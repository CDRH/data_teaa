United States Consulate
Loanda. January 15th 1885

Sir

I have the honor to inform the Department
that I have today taken passage for the sailor,
Albert Svenson to St Thiago per ss "Portugal."

This man is a deserter from the Bark
"Horace Scudder" having stolen a boat and gone
on shore at Novo Redondo, he was handed over
to me by the Portuguese Government having been 
brought to Loanda, by the Gun vessel "Vilhena"
together with another man also a deserter. I 
put them in prison, but this man falling ill
had to go to the hospital and was unable to 
leave in the ship

For his passage I have passed a draft 
on the Secretary of State @ 15 d/s in favor of
Snr Ernst George, Agent at Lisbon of the Steamers
for $36 94/100.

I have the honor to be Sir
Your obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul

To the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC
