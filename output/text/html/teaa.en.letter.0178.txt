To His Excellency
The Minister for Foreign
Affairs of the United States

Sir,

The President of the Republic
of Liberia having thought proper
to name Mr John B. Pinney
Charg√® d'Affaires of Liberia near
the Government of the United States.

I have now the honor of announcing 
the same to your Excellency,
and of praying you to
give credence to whatever he shall
say to you on my part.

He is thoroughly acquainted
with the history and condition of 
Liberia and bore an active and
prominant part in bringing about
the amicable international relations
which



which now so happily subsist
between the United States and
Liberia.

He knows the earnest
desire on our part to cultivate
and perpetuate this friendship
of your powerful Republic and
to deserve it by all the good 
offices in our power.

I have no doubt that
Mr. Pinney will so conduct
himself as to merit your confidence; 
and I avail myself
of this occasion to tender to
you the assurances of my 
distinguished consideration.
