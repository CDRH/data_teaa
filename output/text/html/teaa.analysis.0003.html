Article Analysis

John A. Kasson held diplomatic posts as U.S. Ambassador to Austria-Hungary from 1877-1881
and to the German Empire from 1884–1885. It was during this latter assignment, that
he attended the Berlin Conference (a.k.a. the Kongokonferenz) of 1884-85 and subsequently
persuaded the United States to recognize the sovereignty of the Congo Free State and
to ratify the General Act of the Berlin Conference. Kasson proved successful in the
first endeavor, but failed to convince President Cleveland to present the treaty to
the Senate for ratification.

The purpose of Kasson's 1886 article was to convince readers of the necessity for
the U.S. Senate to ratify the General Act by the April 1886 deadline. The article
opens with a summary of President Cleveland's address in which the president explained
his objection to bringing the Act before the Senate based on his belief that the U.S.
held "no established interests or control" in the "remote valley of the Congo." Kasson
then lays out a detailed summary of what transpired at the conference and the obligations
outlined in the Act, emphasizing that the Act does not obligate the United States
to commit troops to enforcing freedom of navigation of the Niger and Congo Rivers
and free trade in the Congo Basin—the latter a claim made by the State Department.
Kasson concludes that in the interest of promoting Christianity, civilization, and
commerce in the Congo region, the United States should either ratify the Act or accept
it "as a 'separate act' for which it makes provision."1 

Kasson was among the few public American voices that encouraged the United States
to ratify the General Act of the Berlin Conference. As the article makes clear, the
State Department and the President feared that ratifying the Act would bound the country
to intervening in foreign conflicts in foreign colonial possessions where the U.S.
held no strategic, commercial, or diplomatic interest. Despite the fact that the country
was engaged in its own expansion across the continent and overseas in the late nineteenth
century (i.e., the "new imperialism"), many U.S. politicians advocated an isolationist
foreign policy, with some exceptions made for affairs in the Western Hemisphere.

In contrast, Kasson was an expansionist who believed that the United States should
abandon the Monroe Doctrine and pursue territories abroad. Kasson played an active
role in the conference, persuading the delegates to adopt British explorer Henry Morton
Stanley's boundaries for delineating the Congo Basin. He also encouraged the European
powers to respect the rights of Africans and African rulers in deciding if and when
to cede their land. Kasson's plea for ratification of the Act constituted one important
current in the American discourse on the Africa Question which focused on the potential
commercial and economic benefits of the agreement for the United States.2






Excerpt Analysis



Kasson lays out the boundaries of the regions covered by the General Act of the Berlin
Conference, underscoring the commitment of the signatories to insuring freedom of
commerce in the Congo Basin, as well as on the Congo River and all its tributaries
to the east as far as Lake Tanganyika and the Indian Ocean and westward to the Atlantic
Ocean. In addition, he explains that the Niger and Congo Rivers, their tributaries,
and any canals or railroads leading to them, are subject to freedom of navigation
in times of war and peace.
