I last wrote your Honor under date
of August 14th informing you that the US Commercial
Agency at St Paul 'd Loanda was very much
in want of a flag &amp; Sign, &amp; requesting they might
be sent to my care at Salem for me to forward.

I now have to inform you that the Barks

will leave this for Loanda by the 16th or 17th inst.
Any Letters or Packages that the Navy Department
may wish to send to the African Squadron will be forwarded
free of freight, by directing them to the care of
R Brookhouse or myself at Salem. Will you please
notify the Navy Department of this opportunity &amp; will
you cause the sign &amp; flag to be forwarded to me.

Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt
