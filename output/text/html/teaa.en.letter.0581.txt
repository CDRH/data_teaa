U.S. Consulate
Loanda, April 13, 1892

F. O. St. Clair, Esquire 
Chief of Consular Bureau
Washington

Dear Sir:

On the receipt of your letter
dated February 16, 1892, I at once wrote to
the missionary in charge at Gaboon requesting
him to give me the information you desire
concerning the U.S property at that post.

Pending his answer, I hasten to give 
you what I already know on the subject.

Mr. Graham C. Campbell; whom
you mention as having the last, on June 30, 1886,
drawn for salary as U.S. Commercial Agent
at Gaboon, has been since then in the
States and is not expected to return to Africa.

Mr. Joseph H. Reading, who sent,



in February 1887, the last communication you
received from Gaboon, has also been in the
States, for some four years past, and will probably
stay there. He published in 1890 as Philadelphia
a description of the West-Coast entitled "The
Ogowe Band" and was then residing in a 
small town of New Jersey.

Through a Gaboon missionary who called
on me here about two months ago, I know that
at that time the U.S. Coat of Arms was still
hung out at the American Presbyterian Mission
House of Baraka near Libreville, the Capital 
of the "French Congo"; for this is now the official
native of the former Colony of Gaboon.

Probably all the Consular Archives are
there intact as left by Mr. Reading, the
mission station having been uninterruptedly
occupied since his departure.

It is well nigh decided that, owing 
to the prohibition to teach in any but the French
language, all the American Presbyterian
Mission Stations in French territory should



be passed over to the Paris Evangelical Missionary
Society who has a young work in that region.

The efforts of the American Presbyterian
Mission (North) will then be chiefly directed
to the southern and inland portion of the German
Protectorate of Kamer√∫n, where there is greater 
liberty. The flourishing station of Corisco and
Benita will no doubt be kept up as long as 
Spain allows them to develop peacefully.

As to the expediency of continuing or
discontinuing that consular post, allow me to
suggest that unless they be disinterested
philanthropists, consular officers from America
at $1000.00, in a deadly climate like that
of Tropical Africa, will not in fact can not
be of a quality to honour their country or 
to give satisfaction to the Department of State.
They will never stay long enough in their districts 
to form an intelligent opinion of their
state and resources, or obtain reliable information 
of any sort.

In the present state of Africa, the Department 
of State need Consuls who are or
promise to become, authorities on African questions



whose word is of greater weight then the accounts
published in daily papers, who are determined to
make a serious study of their districts, and who
are able to condense the results of their investigations
into readable reports. Such Americans cannot be expected
to spend or sacrifice their lives in tropical 
Africa for $1000.00 per annum.

Any one acquainted with modern Africa, who
peruse our Consular reports on this great Continent
South of the Sahara and north of the Cape, must be
struck with the sad inefficiency of our Consular
in that region, and must realize the need of a 
complete reorganization of that service if it is
do justice to the incalculable importance of that
immense region, not only to humanity at large but
directly to our United States not only morally,
commercially and industrially, but on the highest sense
politically.

Unless our Government's adhesion to the
Brussel's Act is to be an empty form, it behoves
the United State to be kept posted by its own agents
on the real state of slavery and slave-trade in
Africa and this cannot be without our Consular
system in said region entailing a new phase.

I am preparing a series of reports of
Angola.

Very respectfully yours
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Coml Agent
