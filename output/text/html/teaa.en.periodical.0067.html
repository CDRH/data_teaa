The Brussels Agreement.—We are much gratified to find that there
has been a movement, apparently simultaneous and without concert, on
the part of many representative bodies in the United States to petition the
United States Senate to assent to the ratification of the Brussels Agreement
for the suppression of the slave and liquor traffics in America. The
American Board, at its recent meeting, appointed a Committee, consisting
of Rev. Dr. Storrs, Presidents Angell and Rankin, D. Willis James, and
Hon. Chester Holcombe, to present a memorial to the United States Senate
on the subject. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church has.
also spoken clearly its sentiments, and petitions are being numerously
signed by citizens asking the assent of the Senate to the agreement The
Congregational Club of Chicago has also forwarded resolutions on the
subject. We trust that from every quarter petitions will reach our Senate
that shall show it that the Christian and philanthropic people of the land
are in earnest in desiring the suppression of this infamous traffic in liquor
in which many citizens of our country are engaged.—The Missionary
Herald.

King Somayou.—A young student at the Nichols Latin School at
Lewiston, Maine, who goes under the name of Lewis P. Clinton, is really
Somayou, King of the Bassa tribe in the Northwestern part of Africa. The
tribe occupies a territory running back over the Kong mountains, 500
miles in length and 200 miles in breadth, with an outlet to the sea. In
his boyhood Somayou had a strong desire to learn the English language,
so that he might trade for his people. With this determination he ran
away from his tribe and finally found his way to this country under the
care of a missionary. He is not only a good English scholar, but has
shown average ability in mastering Latin, Greek, mathematics, and other
studies. He contemplates a course in Bates College, after which his plan
is to go back to his people; not as a ruler, but for the purpose of 
establishing a civilized colony and devoting his life and energy to the interests
of his people, educationally and religiously. Somayou defrays his 
expenses at school by lecturing.—New York Evening Post.
