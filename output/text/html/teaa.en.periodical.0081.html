The Congo Infamy

At last the world is waking to the shocking truth that King Leopold's pretended philanthropy
in the Congo is in reality a ghastly lie. The whole Congo country is recklessly exploited
for private gain by this human monster. The report of a commission appointed by the
Belgian Chamber of Deputies showed that the natives had been flagrantly robbed of
their rights, that shocking and revolting cruelties were practiced in forcing the
natives to gather rubber for the government and that whenever prosecutions were begun
against white men for crimes against natives, the proceedings were always quashed.
The Berlin Conference of 1885 intrusted the Congo to Leopold's keeping. Then, as now,
he pretended to be a philanthropist and said he wanted to improve the country for
the natives. His whole course in the matter has belied his words. Today there is discernable
the rising of an international indignation at Leopold's indecencies. A resolution
has been introduced in Congress calling for action by the United States in promoting
an international investigation of the Congo. Of course, the first thing Congress ought
to do is to appoint a commission to investigate the Southern part of this country.
But still the Congo question deserves attention from Congress. The newspapers have
discovered that Leopold has a paid lobby in Washington to prevent the adoption of
the resolution introduced. The Congo Reform Association of Boston is doing great work
in promoting the investigation. Leopold in the Congo is a stench in the nostrils of
modern civilization.
