Commercial Agency of the United States,
at Loanda, Washington Febr. 10, 1893

Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

In accordance with your telegraphic 
order "Close Consulate" of &nbsp; &nbsp;
I have closed the U.S. Commercial
Agency at Loanda and returned
to the United States.

The Governor General of Angola,
officially informed by me, announced
the closing of the Agency in the Official
Bulletin, previous to my sailing.

The furniture and archives of the
Agency I left in charge of Mr. L.
C. Burling of the American Methodist
Episcopal Mission at Loanda. This
mission is willing to buy the furniture
at a cheap rate, or to keep it in trust
until the consulate be re-opened.
The archives I have packed in various



boxes, ready for shipment, if the Department
should want them removed: The bound
books (Statutes, Commercial Relations, Consular
Reports etc) fill one large case. The Records 
are packed in a separate box; and so are
the unused Forms and the Manuscripts
(Instructions, Circulars and Correspondence),
with the seals.

As the archives do not contain any
document of real value, and as the Mission
is willing to store them for the government,
I would suggest to the Department to
lease them in their present condition
until the Consulate be re-opened.

Even after my exit of office and
return to the States, the Department will
always find me most willing to serve
the government with my experience and
knowledge of Angola and African
matters generally.

"Care of the Smithsonian Institution"
will always find me.

I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Coml Agent
