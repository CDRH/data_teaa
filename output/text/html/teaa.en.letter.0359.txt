(This is diplomatic)





British Government
propose to take regarding
the numerous protests
and claims arising from 
this arbitrary Coast duty,
and nothing has occurred
to shake me in my opinion
that the Sultan is
responsible for a 5% drawback 
on all duty-paid
goods held by American
merchants on January 1st 91
for German Coast trade.

The question of
making Zanzibar a free
port has been agitated
for some time and meets
with the approval of all
friends of Zanzibar and
as nearly everything is
now passed in bond, the
law to the Sultan would
be only the revenue on
imports consumed in
the islands of Zanzibar
and Pemba



and Pemba and smaller
islands, which revenue
I do not estimate at more
than cost of collecting.
It would therefore appear
that there is no obstacle
in making this a free
port, but the treaties provide 
that the Sultan
must provide suitable
Custom House and go-downs
and transhipment stores,
free of all storage charges
other than the 5% duty
take away this duty and 
we have the Sultan removing 
a Custom House for
nothing. Of course he
objects. It will therefore
be necessary to alter the
treaties to make this a
free port and any such
alterations would probably
be opposed by Germany
as against the interests
of the



Coast Colony opposite
as it doubtless would be.
It is my opinion that
a free-port will be the
only salvation of Zanzibar
and I should strongly
advocate any reasonable
surrender of treaty rights
as regards Custom House
charges, harbor or tonnage
dues, to bring it about.

The question of the
total prohibition of cheap
spirits imported for native
use is also being considered
and like the free-port
question is advocated by
the friends of the place
opposed by the Germans,
and would necessitate a
change of treaty. I am
very strongly in favour
of absolutely prohibiting
the importation of low
proof spirits for native use



I also consider that
with a British Protectorate,
exterritorial rights have
ceased to be of value and
I think it would be for
the best interests of all
concerned, if most of our
judicial powers were
transferred to the British
Court. In fact, as I
look at the situation here
I cannot see why the
English Government does
not make this a crown
colony and be done with
all these half-way
measures. Germany would
probably be the only power
to seriously object, and it
seems to me if the transfer 
of the German Coast
had been used at its full
value England might
have had Zanzibar
without trouble.



In submitting my
views on these important
questions thus freely to
the Department, I trust
I have not exceeded the
bounds of propriety.

I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant.
E. D. Roper Jr
U.S. Consul
