Same as above.



U.S. Consulate,
St. Paul de Loanda
New York Aug 18, 1888.

Hon. G. L. Rives,
Asst. Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform 
the Department that I hereby tender
my resignation, to take date from the 
receipt of this of the office of U.S.
Consul at St. Paul de Loanda,
Africa.

Explanation of this my
action is found in the fact that the
compensation of the office is such as
will force any one no many embarrassments. 
This has, unfortunately,
been my experience both in Africa and
at home.

After having been incumbent
of this office for longer than a year, I
find



find that I am compelled to resign
not only deeply in debt, but actually
without means and with no prospect
of immediate employment.

The poignancy of my sorrow is
added to when I remember that the 
difficulties surrounding my situation
does not alone touch me but, threatens
also my wife and children.

Praying that my resignation
will be accepted and thanking the
Department for its patience and
great consideration.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Henry F. Downing
Consul
