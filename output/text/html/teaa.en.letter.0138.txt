Sir,

Referring to my Despatch
No 79 requesting leave of Absence,
I have the honor to state that it
is of the utmost importance that
I should go to Europe not later
than May, and I also require a 
change as I have been far from
well for some time past, and I 
have therefore to request the Department
to grant my request for
leave of absence as soon as possible.

The gentleman I propose
leaving in charge during my
absence in A. Coleen Esquire
British Consul at this port, who
has already been Acting Consul at the
port of Surinam to the American
Government.

I have also to request the
Department to give me permission 
to

To the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC



to authorize Consul Coleen to 
draw my Salary during my absence.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient Servant
Robt S Newton
U.S. Vice-Consul
