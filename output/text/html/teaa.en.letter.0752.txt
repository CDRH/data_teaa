The latest news from 
Bakel



No 41

US Consulate Goree-Dakar

To the Honorable
James D Porter
Assistant Secretary of State

Sir

There is no further news from
the Bakel district excepting that
the natives home failed in their 
assaults on the post and that
a return column of French troops
from a place farther up the River 
is hastening to relieve the garrison.
It appears however that although
the natives were not able to 
capture the post they killed many
French traders in the town and 
destroyed merchandise valued
at about a hundred thousand
dollars. The wire from St Louis
to Bakel has been cut by the 
natives so that the news that
comes cannot be much depended on  



Troops are being assembled
here for a March into the interior 
but the distance is long to 
Bakel and Steamers cannot
at present ascend much above 
Podor. The rest of the way 
is across deserts and through 
marshes containing sluggish
Marigots which are passed 
with infinite difficulty. The 
French however anticipate
a quick and decisive campaign
and there is but little excitement
about it here.    

It is rumored here that
Ziginchor, the lost Portuguese
post on the Casamansa River
has passed into the hands of 
the French but this I believe
requires confirmation.

I am Sir
Yours truly
Peter Strickland
US Consul
