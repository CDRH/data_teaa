Honorable Wm F. Wharton
Assistant Acting Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

In reply to your circular
dated July 13, 1889. Conveying 
a request from the Secretary
of Agriculture to collect and
forward to the Department 
a small quantity of seeds of 
variety of small quantity of seeds of
varieties of Sorghum, I have 
to inform you that such plant 
is unknown here.

Bishop Wm Taylor of the 
American Mission here, some
time ago informed me that
he intended to try and introduce
it from America, and would
make his experiments on some 
of this mission stations in the
interior. Whether he has
done



done so or not, I am not at
present in a position to say,
as I have heard nothing
further on the subject, and
the missionary in charge of
the station here is at present
in the interior thus preventing
my getting any information
from him on the subject.

I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant
Ed Bannister.
Acting Vice Consul.
