To the Honorable
William F Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington

Sir

In my Dispatch to the Department,
No 128. I took occasion to point out
that the new duties levied here
might prove quite unfavorable to
the interests of American Commerce.

At the date of the Dispatch
however I had conferred with no
American party on the subject, and
the remarks made were simply a
reflection of my own judgment in the
matter. But a few days later I 
received a letter from the Agent of
the American firm from Portland, Maine,
lately established in St Louis, on the 
last page of which he casually mentioned
how the new duties were already affecting
his trade. I have sent and obtained
permission to use this last half sheet
which you will please find enclosed.
The last paragraph contains the summing



up of his views on the subject of 
the duties. The senior member of this 
firm in question is now on his way 
here to look into the condition of
things as lately developed by the duties,
and in the present temper of his agency
it would seem that the business,
established in the beginning with
considerable expense, may not be of
long continuance. Other American
parties have communicated to me
their discouragements, but some of 
them will doubtless keep on until
a change for the better appears
entirely out of the Question.

It would not be so bad if this 
unlooked for check to the business
affected only the few shipowners who run
vessels here. The furnishers of goods "expressly
for this market" are now numerous
throughout the West, and in fact are
represented in most sections of the
United States.

I am esteemed Sir
Very truly Yours
Peter Strickland
U.S. Consul

Inclosure
Last leaf of a letter
mentioned in the text.





Trade is fearful in St Louis, the
retail trade is delivering daily, for example
guinea cashing $7.55 - $7.65 I have bought in
retail for cast at $7.25 Rice that costs me
landed here $31 is offered wholesale at $29 and
in retail $30 by the pound.

Duties have advanced, and there has 
been no corresponding advance in prices.

I am so disgusted since all my
hopes were chopped by the extra 7% slapped
at us that I feel much like "giving it up"

faithfully yours
Francis Lawton
