Bathurst as will be observed from the 
above table is the most considerable
settlement and the only port of Entry:

the Island of St. Mary upon which it is situated 
is but a few feet above the level of 
the sea, sandy and barren and could 
only have been selected as a site for 
a town, from the just of its harbor
affording the only good anchorage in
the neighborhood.

The Colonial Government 
consists of a Governor with an Executive
and Legislature Council the is composed
the former; of the Colonial Secretary, the 
Queen's , and the Collector of
Customs, all of whom are members by 
virtue of their offices: and the latter
has for members The Commander of
the Troops, The Chief Justice The 
Colonial



Colonial Secretary and the Queen's 
by virtue of their offices, and three other persons,
generally selected from the mercantile
community, who are recommended by the
Governor and appointed by the House 
Government. Both of these councils are
presided over by the Governor, who has a 
casting as well as an original vote.
All ordinances and Colonial laws are 
submitted to the House Government for sanction.    

There is no political  nor
assembly.

It is only for a few years past that
the exportation of Ground or Pea Nuts
has been so considerable; now it by
far exceeds all other exports in importance, 
and its cultivation has greatly 
benefited the agricultural interests



of the Colony and the surrounding
country. France is the principal
Continuer and mostly for oleaginous
purposes and its importation gave
employment in the past year to 
18,800 tons of French shipping.

As is well known the quantity used 
in the United States for manufacturing 
or oleaginous purposes is very
small, owing chiefly to the heavy import 
duty of fifteen per centum ad
valorem. What an opening (in a
small way) for the employment 
of the surplus shipping of the United 
States, what a benefit to manufacturers
were those duties abolished: the producers 
in the United States would
perhaps suffer but would not the
benefit to shipping, and manufacturers,
more than counterbalance, any statement 
to the agriculturists.

The number of vessels which arrived 
in this port and their nationalities
is as follows viz

I regret that this Consulate should 
be one of so slight an importance
as to give but little interest to my 
report, however such as it is, I have
the honor now to submit it to you.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most obdt. &amp; humble servt
Danl RB Upton
U.S. Consul.

The Honorable Lewis Cass
Secretary of State of the United States
Washington.
