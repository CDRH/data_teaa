Hon William H. Seward
Secretary of State Washington D.C.

Dear Sir

My Exequatur together with the 
Circular No 47. has been received.

During an interview with the Commander 
in Chief of the French Squadron upon the 
West Coast of Africa, he informed me that 
Three Clyde built steamers had recently 
left Glassgow in Scotland. Some suspicious 
circumstances in regard to the vessels lead
the Authorities in England to notify the 
English and French Admirals here to be
on the look out for them. One of them has
been upon the coast and succeeded in 
making its escape with seven hundred negroes,
though watched by thirteen by thirteen steamers 
of the English squadron. Stationed at 
regular intervals with boats between the vessels

This was in the vicinity of Wydah in the 
Bight of Benin. I have no information of the 
others. The Admiral expressed fears that 
should these vessels not succeed in securing 
slaves they would hoist the Rebel flag 
and



and prey upon American Commerce

By the time I receive an answer to this
I shall have been at my post of duty two  
years, which I suppose is as long as any one 
can remain in this climate upon their first  
residence with safety to health and life.
I would therefore request permission to visit
my family and should my request be granted
to be informed if it will be necessary for 
me to appoint a Vice Comml. Agt.

I have the honor to be your most 
obedient Servant
Henry May 
U.S. Comml. Agt.
