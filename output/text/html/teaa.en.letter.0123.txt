United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
23rd July 1880.

Sir,

I have the honor to inform
the Department that, despatch
No 75, and circular No 18,
and circulars dated Feby 18th 
and 24th, and March 19th marked
separate, have been duly received
at this Consulate and will have
due attention.

Circular of Feby 24th referring
to my not having sent
in the weekly reports required by
the National Board of Health.
The reason of my not having
done so is that it is difficult
to get correct information, and
that since my return to my post
I have not been able to attend
to it owing to illness, but will
see to it in the future. 

Circular 19th March, referring
to Cotton Yarns. No Yarns
of



of the quality mentioned are
used in this market, but I will
get samples of Cotton goods
used here and as requested send
them with all information as
soon as possible.

I have the honor
to be Sir
Your most Obedient
Servant
Robt S Newton
Vice Consul
Acting Consul

To the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
