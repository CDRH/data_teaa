49. Negro Colony of Liberia, 1817-1861.

While Brother Jonathan was adding to his



territory, and gaining experience in colonization, a movement had begun for ridding
him of a part of his children, by colonizing the free blacks in Africa. The first
trouble was to find a part of the earth where persons would be received who, as Jefferson
neatly phrased it, were "not malefactors, but guilty of what the safety of society
under actual circumstances obliges us to treat as a crime"—that is, men who were determined
to be free. In 1820 the first realization of the idea was carried out by President
Monroe, in connection with the American Colonization Society, when eighty-six negroes
were sent to the African coast. From that time for many years the United States took,
in the scattered settlements first known as Liberia and Monrovia, an interest summed
up by Amos Kendall as follows: "To colonize captured Africans, to build homes for
them, . . . to purchase ships for their convenience, to build forts for their protection,
to supply them with arms and munitions of war, to enlist troops to guard them, and
to employ the army and navy in their defence." If this be an exaggerated statement,
it is certainly true that the permanent site of the colony—at Cape Montserado—was
secured by Lieutenant Stockton of the United States ship Alligator, and that the United
States paid for supplies to keep the colonists alive.



In 1837 the people of these African settlements constituted themselves the commonwealth
of Liberia, and in 1847 the little state declared itself sovereign and independent.
Like many other small nations, Liberia soon found herself involved in a quarrel with
Great Britain. Had the settlement been one of white men, there can be little doubt
that the United States would have acknowledged the duty of protecting it. As it was,
the administration of President Polk refused even to acknowledge Liberia as an independent
nation. England, however, came to terms with the little land, agreed to respect the
"sovereignty" of Liberia, and gave her a cutter with four guns—all exactly like a
picture in Punch; but not till 1862 did the United States recognize Liberia as a sister
nation. In 1884 Secretary Frelinghuysen said that "Liberia, although not a colony
of the United States, began its independent career as an offshoot of the country,
which bears to it a quasi-parental relationship."

The colony of Liberia is almost the only example of an eddy of American civilization
turning eastward; and it was too feeble a movement to affect either slavery or territorial
rights in America or Africa. President Lincoln made an attempt to revive the scheme
by placing a new colony in Central America, and was much disappointed at the refusal
of 



the Central American colonies to receive free negroes. Perhaps the Liberians may some
day be stirred up by the good fortune of the Hawaiians to offer themselves to be a
recognized colony of Brother Jonathan's. At present our relation to Liberia is practically
that of a protectorate.
