Hon Thos F. Bayard
Secretary of State.

Dr Sir

I wrote you some
days ago, asking your approval of
my claim for salary as U.S. Consul.
Your letter of the 15th inst. in reply thereto,
is at hand.

I beg to submit in reply that the
circumstances surrounding my case
are extenuating; and that my claim
is entitled to recognition for reasons
stated in my letter of the 4th inst.

Hoping and believing that you will
kindly reconsider your decision of the 
15th inst, and advise me.

I am, my dear Sir
Your obt. servant,
Robt. H. Davis
late U.S. Consul.
