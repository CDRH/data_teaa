Legation of Liberia
Yonkers, N.Y. March 31st, 1870

Sir

In Jany 1857, in answer to 
an application from me, for a U.S. 
Cruiser to visit Monrovia, Liberia,
as an uprising of the natives was
apprehended, and a combination of
of the various tribes was understood
or reported to be forming, for the
purpose of attacking the Liberian
settlements, I received a communication 
from the U.S. State Department,
under date of 5th February 1867, stating
that Admiral Goldsborough, commanding
the European Squadron had been in a instructed

to Honble Hamilton Fish
Secretary of State
Washington 
D.C.



to direct the next cruiser sent by
him to the coast of Africa, to visit
Liberia.

Advices by telegraph from Paris
have appeared in the various papers,
stating that the Liberians were engaged
in war with the natives.

It has heretofore been reported, that
the natives have been incited to war
by English traders; and the late
humiliation of Liberia by English men
of war would naturally further encourage 
them to attack the settlements.

I have heard no particulars,
but if not inconvenient, or inconsistent 
with other requirements, I respectfully 
ask that the same countenance
or support may be afforded as was
done in Feby 1857.

I have the honor to be, with
the highest consideration
Sir, Your obedient Servant
H. M. Schieffelin
