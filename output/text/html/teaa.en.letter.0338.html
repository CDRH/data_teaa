Inclosures 1.



Nassau Rens. Co. N.Y.
May 29th 1879.

Hon,
William M. Evarts
Secretary of State
Washington 
D.C.

Sir:

In consequence of my health not 
being fully restored, it is deemed 
important that my return to Gaboon 
should be defered a little longer.
Permit me therefore to solicit from 
His Excellency the President, an extention 
of my leave of absence till 
October, when I hope to be able to 
return to Gaboon accompanied by a 
reinforcement of several American Missionaries.

Also permit me most respectfully,
to ask the President, to change 
the title of the Commercial Agency,
that of a full Consul-ship. 

This 
change, I solicit, because of the 
increasing importance of Gaboon as a naval



and Commercial port, mid-way,
between the Niger and Congo rivers,
in connection with the grand 
Interior Explorations and prospective 
increase of American Commercial, 
Philanthropic, and Christianizing 
interests in the "Dark Continent."

I have the honor to be
Sir:
Most respectfully, 
Your obt. servt.
Albert Bushnell.
U.S. Com. Agent.
for Gaboon
