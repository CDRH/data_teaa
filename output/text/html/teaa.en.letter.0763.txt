U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar
January 18th 1887

To the Honorable
James D Porter
Assistant Secretary of State

Sir

Enclosed please find a
Statement, in duplicate, Form 130, 
showing the direct imports &amp; exports
between Goree-Dakar and the United States
for the year 1886.

Apparently the imports have been
less than usual, but this erroneous
showing is principally owing to the 
fact that none of the European
Colonial firms have had goods
arrive for more than a  year direct
from America.

It is for the interest of all 
large European concerns to discourage
as much as possible direct trade
with America: hence they curtail
their dealing with resident American Merchants and import



such articles of American production
as are absolutely needed in the 
prosecution of their business either
through their correspondents in Europe
or if the articles be bulky sometimes
direct from America, more often than
not however in foreign bottoms. It
thus becomes evident that no statement
like the one enclosed can indicate with
any degree of exactness the amount 
of American Goods actually consumed
in a country like this: the enclosed
statement merely indicates what has
been done here by means of American
vessels in face of an opposition
organized as much as possible
to exclude them from the coast.

I am esteemed Sir
Very respectfully yours
Peter Strickland
US Consul
