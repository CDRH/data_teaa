United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
Oct 15th 1882.

Hon J.C. Bancroft Davis
Asst Sectry of State
Washington D.C.


Sir

In consideration of the unhealthy state of
this locality at times, I would most respectfully 
solicit the Depart. of State, for a standing
permissions to leave this consulate in charge
of the Vice, or actg. vice consul, whenever
circumstances and urgency in case of 
sickness may compel me to leave Loanda
for a few weeks further North or South as 
may be directed by the Doctors

This request may appear to you, from
one who has but just joined his post,
of duty, to be a departure from the general
principles of the Depart. but I trust 
that the special nature of my humble 
request may induce you and the Hon:
Secty of State to take the matter with
favorable consideration.

Having consular agencies further North
and South I may be able if such 
is granted to me, to see personally 



how the agencies are, and instruct them
in their duties toward the U.S. govt,
commerce, shipping &amp;c. &amp;c.

I have been sick for over a month with 
Bilious or green fever and have tried to 
perform the duties I have been intrusted 
with the best of my ability

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
L de R du Verge
US Consul.
