The Influence of Talladega College

By President Benjamin M. Nyce







Do the students do what they can to support themselves and is there an increase toward
self-support which induces toward self respect? Are they in turn becoming the helpers
of their people? Let the story of Talladega College in Africa, Lucy Gann Sheppard,
Maria Feering and Lillian Thomas working in the hear of the Congo Free State be your
answer. Let thousands in every



walk of life in the South, with Talladega's Christian training, be your answer. Let
hundreds of loyal alumni who have given thousands of dollars to the institution and
who have to-day forty of their own children at Talladega be your answer.

These facts concerning the Negro cannot be gainsaid. When he is helped he improves
very rapidly. If flat on his back he is always looking up and is grateful for assistance.
Left to himself and his old time surroundings he is not improving, he is retrograding.
Work for the southern Negro must be pushed. We cannot stop if we would. National destiny
is concerned in this matter. Now as surely as in '61 and '65 our peril is largely
in the South and thither we must send our forces. We must increase and better supply
the army that is here warring against ignorance and sin. A little aid will go a great
way in the South. What in a northern college would be considered a trifle, in a southern
school would be considered a princely sum. Board is cheap, dress is plain, salaries
are meager. A small sum would endow a scholarship and not a large sum would provide
perpetually for a teacher. What is expended on one gymnasium in the richer states
would equip an industrial department in the South. No colleges need help more than
these and nowhere will aid go farther than among the schools which are doing as exigent
and as fruitful a work as the sun shines upon. Yet no colleges are so liable to be
neglected, and for obvious reasons. The abolitionists



are mainly an extinct race. War memories are fast fading. Few now read Uncle Tom or
think of his cabin. A new generation has arisen which knows not the black Joseph or
whether he be still in prison or not. Continually the stream of benevolence is irrigating
places already well watered, while currents small and few flow toward he more needy
South. For the present the help needed must come largely from the North. There is
no other base of supplies. The South, white or black, is not yet able to meet the
need, although in many  cases they are doing what they can. There is no better way
to help save the country and at the same time lift up the dark continent, than to
generously equip these southern colleges. This beyond question is the most wise and
efficient means of solving the great educational and missionary problem in which both
North and South must share the responsibility.
