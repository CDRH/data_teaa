Sir

Under Date of July 1st, I
informed Your Honor that I had returned from
St Paul 'd Loanda on Leave of Absence, &amp; at same
date sent my Returns for the Quarter ending March
31st 1861.

The Commercial Agency at Loanda
is very much in want of a sign &amp; flag. 
Will you please direct these to be sent to my care
at Salem Mass &amp; I will see that they reach
their proper destination.

Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt
