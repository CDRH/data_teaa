Assistant Secretary of State

Sir

I have just received "Shoe
&amp; Leather" Circular dated April
6th 1885, and as there are no statistics
at hand or indeed available
to impart information I can
only reply from impression
derived from long experience.

There are probably no articles
of American leather manufacture
used in Senegal at present.
About 1878 an American merchant 
named Matthew Bartlett sent
two or three small Invoices
of light fancy shoes &amp; slippers
which sold well, but on his 
retirement from the business
which happened two or three



years later all such shipments 
were discontinued.

The only American Merchant
now doing business regularly in
Senegal is F C Butman Esq. No
34 Central St. Boston. All others
have either failed up or been
driven off by European competition.
Mr Butman for reasons which
will appear hereafter has hitherto
made no shipments of articles
of leather manufacture.

There is at present no 
demand for leather in Senegal,
but of Shoes the Consumption
is quite large and rapidly increasing.
All finds are in request, but
light fancy shoes are most wanted.
All sizes are wanted, but 
for the most part they should
be medium inclined to small.
Very long-heeled plantation
feet are not prevalent in
this part of Africa.

The principal reason



why shoes cannot with advantage
be exported from America to Africa
lies in the fact that excepting to 
a very limited extent, as in the case
of Hides &amp; Rubber, Americans cannot
take the produce of the country in 
payment. American vessels consequently 
earn scarcely any freight homewards,
so that an outward voyage only
can be counted on to pay all
expenses and yield a profit. 
American Merchants under such 
conditions can only handle at a 
living profit a few staples,
generally not much manufactured
that are peculiary American, 
such as Tobacco, Lumber, Petroleum,
and some kinds of provisions.
It is next to impossible without
taking produce in payment, as
Europeans do, to complete successfully
against goods of European manufacture.
Our Merchants are now obliged
to deal only with the large 
European Houses who can give    



Bills in payment, and most
of these large houses being always 
stocked with Goods of European 
manufacture which they are compelled
to receive from their principals in
Europe are of course keenly interested
to keep competing American Goods
out of the market.  

The principal production 
of Senegambia is peanuts, of
which 7,000,000 bushels are said to 
be exported to Europe annually.
For a few years subsequent to our
Civil War a portion of this peanut
trade, in spite of our high tariff,
was diverted to the United States.
All our vessels then carried full
and paying cargoes homewards,
which enabled our merchants to
deal with traders of small means,
and introduce new articles in
spite of the opposition of the 
large European Houses. Senegal
ports were at that time
much frequented by American



vessels, and the business for 
all engaged in it including
Merchants, Shipowners, Agents,
Manufacturers and Supercargoes
was thriving. But in time 
the wide margin of 32 cts
per bushel afforded American 
Nutgrowers by our protective 
tariff had its effect and 
Africans disappeared gradually
from our markets. Simultaneously
our West African trade began
to languish for lack of return
cargoes, until one American
Concern after another was
obliged to withdraw with their 
vessels from a business which 
under the changed circumstances
could no longer yield them 
a living profit. Whether 
the notion has on the whole
been a gainer by paying
for the creation of a nut
monopoly within its borders
at the expense of many



other important industries
it is of course not my 
province to determine. I 
simply state the facts
which have come under
my observation, because 
they have a practical
bearing on the questions 
I am expected to answer.
Probably however the 
American nutgrowing interest 
is now so well established
that if the duty which has 
festered it were repealed
to-morrow the receipts of the 
farmers would suffer no 
sensible diminutive, while
if American Merchants could 
only be enabled to ship enough
of nuts to ballast their vessels 
it might give them a hold 
of this market sufficient
to control it for all articles
in the manufacture of which 
Americans are supposed to excel.



Perhaps I should state
before clubing that the shoes
now current here are of French 
origigen and no dearer than 
ours. But they lack the 
style and finish that ours
have and on strictly even
terms I am sure they could
not compete. It is also
worthy of note that childrens
shoes are getting to be used 
in considerable quantities
which perhaps more than
any other circumstances indicates
that there will soon be
an increase in the quantity
wanted. The prevalence of 
Chigres, a species of flea,
which had lately been imported
from the West Indies and
burrows in the toes of the 
natives when exposed is 
also having considerable 
influence to compel the 
wearing of shoes among them.   



Finally, there seems
to be no reason but the one 
referred to why American 
Shoe-dealers should not 
find as profitable a market
here for their wares as in
any other foreign country, 
of like population and 
resources. It will perhaps 
be a century before the 
Senegambians begin to 
manufacture shoes for 
themselves, but their
purchasing disposition
and capacity are
improving every day.

I have the honor to be
Very truly yours
Peter Strickland
US Consul
