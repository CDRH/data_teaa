Liberia.

The Americo-African Republic. Prof. T. Mc'Cant Stewart's Book.





Prof. T. McCant Stewart's book on Liberia or the Negro Republic, is  worthy literary
production. He says the name "Dark Continent" has lost its significance. He says Mungo
Park is the father of African exploration. The Phoenicians sent out colonies to the
dark continent, and the war like Greeks made conquests there. The Roman standards
were also unfurled on African soil; but so far we know these nations confined there
operations to the coast of the Red and Mediterranean seas and Egypt. In 1788, "The
African Association" was formed in England, for the purpose of exploring inner Africa.
They sent out Mungo Park, whose great career as an explorer inspired Overweg, Livingston,
Stanley, and De Brazza, and led them to achieve a work for Africa. * * * * *

Africa is a beautiful country. The golden-sanded beach stretches away into the distance.
The waves look like crystal drops so they break amidst the golden sands. The water
of the ocean, lake and river are clear as crystal, beautiful as a sea of glass. The
azure skies glisten in the light of the sun, but grow soft when the stars hold their
vigil around the midnight throne.

Monrovia, built on a plateau including an area of about three quarters of a mile,
square, eighty feet above the level of the sea, on the summit of the Cape Mesurado.
The Plymouth Rock of Liberia is picturesque. Sixty five years ago, a band of brave,
heroic colored people from America landed and established a home of their own. Here,
thirty eight years ago, a government of the Negro, for the Negro and by the Negro,
was instituted, amidst praises and prayer.

The Americo-African

Republic is situated on the western shore of Africa, occupying what is known as the
Grain Coast. Running down the west coast we come to a French possession, Grand Bassam;
and next, the English colonies, Axim and Cape Coast. Space will not permit a longer
review.
