To the Department of State

Subject. Requesting
leave of absence







No 79

United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
16th September 1881.

Sir

I have the honor to 
request the Department to 
grant me leave of absence for
6 months as both the partners
in my Commercial firm having
died in April last, it may be
absolutely necessary that I 
should visit Europe about
February or March. I will
arrange with one of my friends
to take charge of the Consulate
during my absence, whose name
I will advise in good time to the
Department. As I only intend
going to treat of business matters
I do not expect to be away for
a longer period than 3 or 4 months.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most Obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul

To the 
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
