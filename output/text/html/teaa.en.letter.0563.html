No. 9

U.S. Commercial Agency
at St. Paul de Loanda,
Lisbon, July 24, 1891

Mr. Heli Chatelain
to the Hon. William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to report my
arrival at this port, en route to
St. Paul de Loanda, and to mention 
some of the difficulties met 
on this route.

1) The shortest, or rather quickest,
route to Angola (St. Paul de Loanda)
is that of the Portuguese mail,
provided one is able to find suitable
communication between England and



Portugal. I had read of the project,
or decision, of having steamers sail
from Lisbon to Loanda on the 21st
and 6th of each month; but not being
sure, I determined to inquire in
New York. Here the Portuguese Consul
knew only of the departures on the 6th;
Cook's Agency idem. I sailed to 
England by first opportunity in
order to find out there, both about
the Lisbon packets for Loanda and
the steamers from England to Loanda.

2) In England I learnt that there 
is indeed a steamer leaving Lisbon
on the 21st and there I might
catch it by one of the Southampton
steamers, all of whom were due in Lisbon
about the some time.

3) The time for the connection being



very limited, and the required
custom house despatches and visas
of Passport taking to much time,
the steamer of the 21st was missed
and I must wait for the next 
one of the 6th of August, which is
due in Loanda about the 1st of
September.

Besides the visa of the American
Consulate I was obliged to get
another from the Police of the Port
which cost 2.800 reis  that
is a little over three dollars. My
baggage had to go through the same
process as that of non-consuls, and
I found that most Portuguese officials think
a Commercial Agent is nothing more
than a Consular Agent.

The result of my experience is that



although the British and African lines
from Liverpool to Loanda is not the 
most direct nor the quickest in
theory (in the time actually spent
at sea) yet it is the most convenient 
both as regards speed,
comfort and economy, because the
correspondence between the steamer
from America and that going to 
Loanda can easily be arranged
from America, and there is no
custom house delay nor pass-port
expense etc., to the English
steamers do not call at Lisbon.

4) I am improving the fortright I
am forced to spend here, in getting
useful information on the subject
of commercial possibilities between
my consulate and Angola America, and



on the plains and purposes of the
colonial centre at Lisbon with regard
to this African colonies. In the present 
crisis, however, nobody knows
what may happen in the nearest
future.

I found the people at Oporto
deeply and seriously excited and
here the highest and lowest clans 
are, so to say carelessly, in response on the ""
looking out for "somebody to do
something or anything", but no one
knows who is to do it, nor what 
is to be done.

I have the honor to be,
Sir, your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Commercial Agent

No. 9

U.S. Commercial Agency
at St Paul de Loanda,
Lisbon, Portugal, July 24, 1891

To Hon. William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to enclose the Report
on U.S. Coaling-stations in Africa
referred to in our interview when I 
left Washington, and to beg you to transmit 
the same to the Navy Department

This Report tries to show what points
are most desirable as coaling-stations
and may possibly be acquired by 
the United States.

I am, Sir, Your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Commercial Agent



Enclosure No. 1

Report on U.S. Coaling-stations
in Africa, their desirability,
possibility and suitable points.



Report
on Coaling-stations in Africa.

(1) The desirability of coaling stations
for the U.S. Navy on several points
of Africa is best understood, no
doubt, by the Navy Department, and
needs not to be dwelt upon.

(2) Some of the desirable, and probably 
acquirable, points are the following:

a) Fayal, or some other point on 
one of the Azores. The whole population 
of the Azores would rejoice to
see the U.S. acquire some land in 
their islands, and the Portuguese Government 
might not object persistently 
in the present state of affairs

b) Some port of the Cape Verde Islands,
where the whole population is also



most favorably disposed toward the
United States.

(c) An island, or the whole, of Portuguese
Guinea. The sale or abandonment of 
this colony, which has given Portugal nothing 
but trouble and expense, has often
been demanded by Portuguese statesmen
even when the national finances were
in a relatively flourishing condition.
If anything could be got for for it, there
is little doubt that the Portuguese government 
and "Cortes" would hail with
joy an honorable opportunity of
parting with that irksome colonial
appendage. Under American administration 
there need be no fear of 
rebellions like that which the Portuguese 
have recently had to deal with.
I think that possession is both the



most promising for a good administration, 
and the one that can be obtained
on the most favorable terms. The Navy 
Department is the best judge of its
excellency as far as geographical
situation and anchorage are concerned
The climate is, whatever some may
say, not a bit worse than that of 
the British and French possessions
to the north and south of it.

d) Some land might be obtained
on the Principe and St. Thomas Islands,
but Cabinda, just north of the
Congo mouth, is by far the most
desirable point of the whole coast
and could probably be acquired
either as a whole or, at least, in
part. Portugal has already spent
more money on it than it is worth



to a nation that holds so much
valuable lands, and there is no prospect 
of Portugal extending is as
the expense of either the Congo State
or France. The American fleet of whaling
vessels has for many years make
Cabinda this gathering point, and
the sea-faring Cabindas are well
acquainted with American ships.

This concludes the list of the
available places under the Portuguese
flag and situated on the West-Coast
I know from personal friends connected 
with more Portuguese statesmen 
and from the discussion of
the subject in the "Cortes" that
the best solution, (if a solution be
possible) of the present financial
crisis would be found in these



sale of superfluous colonies or territories, 
and that the United States
would have the preferences. Only
it is considered inconsistent with
the national dignity to make the
first other. But overtures of the
U.S. on this subject would be welcomed, 
and the mission of Sr. Arroyo
to the U.S. for other objects could
be utilised for negotiations of this 
sort.

It does not look as though there
would be any insuperable difficulty
in obtaining from the Portuguese
some harbor of their East-African
possession.

e) Of the Spanish possessions in
West-Africa, which have no promising 
future before them unless they



fall into better hands, a point of
Fernando Po might be ceded to the 
U.S. as well as to Germany, who
already has a coaling station on that
large island. But Corisco and Benito, where
the missionaries of the American
Presbyterian Church (North) have been,
and still are, the only pioneers of
civilization and Christianity, and where
important congregation of 
have already been gathered, would
seem to be every way a more bearable
site. The island of Anno Bom,
too whose most regular visitors are
our American whaling ships, and
which is to Spain a main source
of expense, might prove to be a 
good place for the object in view.

f) Finally Liberia, our ward



and the light-house of the rising
African (native) states, would probably 
welcome the moral support which
the pressure of a U.S. coaling station
would offer it. Still, some of the
preceding points seem to be preferable,
principally Portuguese Guinea (Bissau
and Bolama) Cabinda or Corisco.

The present crisis or Portugal
which cannot last long, at least
in this acute stage, offers the
best, and possibly the last,
opportunity for the acquisition
of desirable points for coaling-stations 
on the route from America
to Europe (Azores) South Africa,
India and Australia. One 
of the Azores, Portuguese Guinea
and Cabinda would form a



splendid chain both for our
Navy and our coming merchant
navy to Africa.

I shall gladly furnish any
more information that may be
desired on the subject of this
Report, and past my personal
influence with the Portuguese, and
fearlessness of African climate, at 
the disposal of our government 
for the attainment of the objects 
in question.

Respectfully submitted
by Heli Chatelain
U.S. Commercial Agent
