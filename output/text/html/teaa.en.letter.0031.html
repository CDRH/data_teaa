Dear Sir,

Yours is just at
hand.

Send me the $300, and I
will resign.

Truly yours,
(Signed). S. A. Andrews.






March 19.

S. A. Andrews Esqr.

Dear Sir, Yours of the 17th instant
is received. You must have misunderstood
my letter of the 14th inst. wherein on second
reading you will perceive I did not offer to
pay you $300.- in advance, but $100.- per
year for three years provided I or an Agent
of the House of Brookhouse held the office
of U.S. Coml Agent at Loanda for that
space of time. It certainly would not
be



be right to pay you $300.- in advance for an
uncertainty, as on your resignation the State
Department might appoint someone else.
I hold myself responsible to do exactly as
I wrote you on the 14th, and will on those
conditions send you on obligation for $100.-
payable at the end of each year for three
years to any party you may authorise 
to receive it.

Very respy,





Department of State.
