Hon G. L. Rives,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to submit
to the Department the following:

The desire of our people to 
extend their foreign trade is inducing
them to look towards this and adjoining 
parts of Africa as a possible field
for cultivation. If this is true, it is well
for them to know that, while it is by 
no means impossible for them to secure
a valuable market here, there are many
obstacles to overcome, the greatest of which
is inexperience but an examination
of the methods of other countries will
teach them much.

The commercial nations of 
Europe recognizing that the success
of



of endeavor in these parts depended
upon a knowledge of its people, adopted
a system the wisdom of which is paved
by their large and successful dealings,
and, if our people act upon the belief
that they can conduct their enterprises
under different rules, they are making
a mistake which will cost them dear,
for costly experiment will only prove
the value of England's and Germany's
methods.

An internal knowledge of the
people, their wants and their habits in
a necessity. This is to be had only by
contact and American resident representatives 
of houses, learning the dialects &amp;c.
is of first importance; for often, the 
purchase of produce, does not so much
defend upon the quality of the goods,
as it does upon the reputation of the
trades.

As all or any of their habits
may be of value as guides to a study
of their character. I have taken this 
method of describing a few of those
customs



customs which are more or less general.

That part of this country
which is on the coast line and between
Lat. 5ยบ South, and Lat. 15ยบ 20' South,
contains some twenty different tribes.
These again are divided and subdivided
and, while in some respects are alike, there
are many points of divergence.

When referring to the habits
and customs of these natives, attention
is drawn to the question of slavery; but
as practiced by them, it takes a complexion 
so mild that it carries with it
amongst them, no hardships. Their laws
make it a necessity for the owner to
give them every care, attend to them when
sick, feed and clothe them, bury and marry
them and happiness in every direction, and so
little difference is made, that the owners
in speaking of their slaves, call them,
"son or daughter."

The peaceful dispositions
of these coast tribes prevents war from
being a purveyor for the ranks of
slavery



slavery, but these are found, through
the workings of their laws, which are
strict, a plentitude of victims. Offences
against property are causes for slavery or
death, any one caught stealing becomes,
be he who he may, chief or subject, the
property of the one stolen from the most
trivial things; for instance, spitting on
another's shoe, is looked upon as a heinous
crime deserving of death or slavery.

The source from which flows
the greatest supply is their superstitions.
Witchcraft is their only belief, and all
cases of accident or misfortune are
ascribed to it. Sickness, death, failure
of crops are all reasons for consultation
with a "fetish" man, who, selecting a
victim charges him with being the cause.
The accused, and often his family, are
either killed or sold into slavery, yet
they have the right to appeal to trial
by ordeal.

Trial with these people is
an ordeal by poison. This custom is 
not particular to Angola but, is 
common



common to the whole West African
Coast; for I have seen the same superstition 
displayed with slight changes,
in Liberia and on the Gold Coast. As
the "modus operandi" of applying the
test may be found interesting, I will
attempt to describe it.

The poison used in this savage
performance is prepared by pulverizing its
powder the hard, thick bark of a tree
which the natives call "sassi-wood",
the powder so made, is then dissolved
in hot water and is taken by the individual 
in small and frequent doses,
until it acts. It expresses itself either
as an emetic, meaning innocense, or
as a laxative, meaning guilt, or causes
causes a cessation of the pulsation
of the heart, and death.

The scene surrounding the
preparation of this poison, called "casca",
are horrid beyond the powers of description,
and, when seen by one, who in a sense,
is a descendant of these people such
thoughts spring to being as suggests grati-
tude



tude for causes which have made me 
what I am.

The victim being found, the
act begins; "fetish"men and assistants,
with old and toothless hags adjourn
to the depths of the forest where in 
a place so formed by nature that its
echos will multiply their howlings,
they choose a spot and "fetish" it as suited
to their incantations. In a central position 
a mortar containing a pestle is
sunk into the ground. when the head
"fetish" man, mute and with stealthy
motions, take a position alongside the
mortar, with his assistants and the 
old hags forming, a circle around him
and thus, in immovable silence, they
remain until the gloom of night
descends to lend assistance to the
horrors of the scene. Then animation
takes the place of quiet and, the 
of the forest is polluted by the 
howlings of the savage crew, several
circles of fires spring to life, having
for a central figure the head "fetish"



"fetish" man and the mortar, between
each of the fires are displayed their
grotesque idols "fetishes" and "charms," and
the making of "casca" is commenced.

The head "fetish" man putting
a piece of the bark in the mortar gives it
a blow with pestle. This example is
followed and repeated by his assistants
and the old women. As the night 
grows old action becomes more violent,
until the savages in drunken and
delirious frenzy discard their cloths and
brutal in their superstition, moisten the
fatal mixture with blood flowing from
self inflicted wounds.

Blood painted savages naked
in maddened, dance, amongst many
fires, whose lurid flames, accents
the forest's gloom where echoes, in answer
to the howlings of the yelling throng,
find fitting accompaniment in the
roaring of the beasts of the woods.
The flitting bat, and mournful
cry of the owl, with the moon
sending her light between the 
overhanging



overhanging branches of the trees,
to cast fantastic shadows over all
form a scene worthy of "Dante's Inferno."

The victim, in the meantime,
has been made the solitary occupant
of his hut where, during the long
hours of night, he has been forced
to listen to the scoldings and threatenings 
of the women of his town, who 
surround it. This is no light infliction 
for many of them have vivid
imaginations and are celebrated 
for their descriptions of the powers
of "fetish."

The hottest hour of the 
following day being the time appointed 
for the application of the
test, the subject is then taken to
a place which has been "prepared."
A path, fully exposed to the rays
of the sun, at both ends of which
are vessels containing "casca," and 
lined on both sides with natives,
young and old, male and female,
armed with all sorts of weapons is



is a course on which he is to run
back and forth until the fetish,
which is given to him alternating at
each end of the course, works.

In running he has his 
advocate, who preceeds him with a 
bunch of palm leaves in his hand,
and encouraging him in these words,
"run, run, run, do not stumble, do not
fall, you are innocent and "fetish" can-
not catch you," at the same time he
is closely pursued by a native holding
a naked sword, who shouts "fetish"
pursues you, confess, confess, you are
guilty and must die." If in running
he should stumble or fall he is at
once and with great cruelty killed
by those that line the path, but
if enduring the fatigue, the poison
asserts itself as an emetic, he is
declared innocent. if as a laxitive,
guilty; and either dies or is sold into
slavery.

Every town has King
but he has very little power as it 
is



is all in the hands of a council composed 
of the old men. The crown is
hereditary but because of the uncertainty 
of paternity, the natural
sequence of their understanding of the
laws of morality, it descends to the 
child of the sister of the King

When a civilized traveller
arrives at a native town he is received 
with ceremony and treated
kindly. Before entering a town he
advises its king of his desire to visit
him, and after receiving permission,
it is well for to forward
his compliments to King and council
by a bottle of rum, as well as by
sending a few glass beads to the
King's wives after entering the town
he is at once escorted to a large
enclosure when he finds the King
and all his subjects, salutes are
then given and returned, by clarifying
the hands in a peculiar manner,
followed by a welcome in words,
replied to in like manner by the
traveller,



traveller, who, after making the
King a present or "dash" of cloth
and rum, is conducted to a hut
where he finds food and a bath
already prepared for him, as well
as one of the maidens of the town
to act as his handmaiden. When
the time arrives for the traveller to
take his departure another general
meeting and more presents the
King, in return receiving a sheep
or goat. Bidding farewell to 
to the King and council some of the
young men, warriors, conduct
him a short distance and then 
leave him free to pursue his journey.

There is no ceremony of
marriage except mutual consent.
The man has to make a large
present to his wife's family and
on the night when his wife is
delivered, give a "batuka" or dance.
If he fails to supply his wife,
who comes to him naked, with
clothing and house keeping ap-
pliances



pliances, it becomes her right to
return to her fathers house.

Women give birth to children
with the greatest ease. At one time
I had occasion to want some rice
flour, I directed a woman to prepare 
it and after putting her to work,
went away, becoming occupied I
forgot it. After a few hours I was
reminded of the want and went
to find out what caused the delay.
I discovered the same woman singing,
and busily working at the mortar,
and when I asked why it was not
finished, received this reply; "Massa
I been go bush biffa make do some
ting", at the same time lifting
from the ground and showing me
a new born baby.

The methods of burial are 
more complicated. The body immediately 
after death is put into
a shallow hole which has been
dug in the floor of the hut in 
which it died. It is then covered
with



with a thin layer of earth, even which
fires are kept burning until the body
becomes hardened. It is then taken 
out and stretched on a frame and
suspended over fires until it became
smoke dried, after which it is stood
in one of the corners of the hut,
where it remains, one of the family,
for years before final burial.

The belief of the natives in
"fetish" engenders a general fear of
one another, causing them to indulge
in many strange and amusing practices. 
Hospitality makes it necessary
that the guest be provided with "meal
and meat." This omitted offense is given
and an appeal is made to"fetish." It
sometimes happens that the unexpected
visitor finds the larder empty, but
the host, equal to the occasion,
sends and borrows a "lent rat,"
which is a common field rat which
has been roasted on a spit. The rat 
is then covered with a paste made
of mandiocea meal and handed
to



to the guest, who, careful not to
touch the meat eats the meal. this
is continued until his hunger is
satisfied, when the rat is returned
to the owner. The guest has been
entertained with "meal and meat"
and the host is relived from any
fear of "fetish."

Time being of no value to
these people they will when seeking
a market for their products travel
miles for a difference of a few
beads or a yard of cloth, or to
find a trader known to them. I
remember when I was trading
in Liberia, that in barter for
a quantity of produce, I gave
with other goods, a lot of powder;
some two months afterwards the
native who had received these
goods returned, bringing with 
him all he had received, and
complained that one of the kegs
of powder was light in weight.
Examination showed that it



wanted about 1/2 of a pound, the
mistake corrected he went away
satisfied. so, to recover a value 
of about twenty cents, he, with
some twenty carriers, had spent 
at least six weeks on the road.

A peculiarity is their
dislike to trade with strangers.
They prefer to take less from
or be cheated by traders whom 
they know and who are familiar 
with their habits. This prejudice
is overcome only by contact
and learning their ways.

The customs and habits
as before described are more or
less common, to Angola and the
whole of the West Coast. There are
many more, local in their nature,
that, or which, may be subject
matter for future despatches.

I have the honor to be;
Sir
Your obedient servant
Henry F. Downing
U.S. Consul.
