Africa.



—Bishop William Taylor, now in his 68th year, left New York for a second four years'
sojourn in Africa, December 1. Notwithstanding his age, he plunges into the wilds
to accomplish a work sufficient to tax the physical energies of the strongest man,
thirty years younger. Fevers, perils from the natives, a burning equatorial sun—these
have no terrors for him. He is "moving out on the high lines of human impossibilities,
trusting alone in Him with whom all things are possible," and he is strong in faith
for the conversion of the heathen millions of the "Dark Continent." He was to preside
over the annual Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, at Greenville,
Liberia, on January 10.
