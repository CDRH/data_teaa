Sir

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 
2 circulars dated Sept 5th and 13th 1882. In 
answer to your circular of Sept. 13th I would 
respectfully state that I have already brought
the subject before the civil and military goods of 
Angola with the Islands of St. Thom√© and Princess
included, offering them the best of refined Petroleum
for city and military use, as mentioned to the state
Dept. in my despatch No 6. "That Kerosene oil was
in great demand here and all over this coast.
But the shippers and masters of Am: vessels should 
be very careful how they deal with the Whites and 
Blacks of this part of the country, Am: commerce
has almost run down by Am: shippers and 
own fault, as reported in my despatch No 17.
Another important trade will soon be of 
farming implements of all kinds.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
L. de R. du Verge
