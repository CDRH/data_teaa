Extract of Royal Decree of
21st October 1880

Having heard the Council of 
the Foreign Office and the Cabinet Council
I have decreed the following:

Article 1: A tonnage due is hereby
established in the Colonies of
Portugal leviable on Foreign &amp;
National Vessels either on

either sailing or steam entering
the ports of the Portuguese
Colonial Provinces are subject to
the tonnage dues laid down in
the annexed Table signed by
the Minister and Secretary
of Marine &amp; Colonies

This due is collected by 
the Custom House of the first
port of the Colonial Province or
by the "Posto Fiscal" where
there



there is no Custom House. The
vessel continuing the same 
voyage can enter any other port
or ports of the said Province
without paying fresh tonnage
dues.

Article 3: All dues that may now be in
force collected on Foreign or
National Vessels in the ports
of the Colonial Provinces under
the title of Anchorage, tonnage
or light dues are hereby revoked.

in the port of Macau with
regard to the dues actually
collected on shipping and the
