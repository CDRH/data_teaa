No. 28.

Consulate of the United States,
Loanda, April 29, 1891.

Honorable W. F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

In compliance with
the instructions conveyed
in the Circular dated 20
September 1890, I have the 
honor to transmit herewith
a "Report on the production
of Crude India Rubber" in the 
Province of Angola and
its dependencies.

The delay in forwarding
it is owing to want of quick
communication with the
sources of information, and 
certain difficulty in getting
at statistics.

I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obedient servant
Ed Bannister
Vice Consul.
