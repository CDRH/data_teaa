The African Slave Trade.

Professor Drummond in the June Scribners', and a writer in a recent issue of the United
Presbyterian Magazine, give us a chapter of horrors on the slave traffic as at present
carried on in Central Africa, so terrible, so diabolical in cruelty and atrocity as
to call loudly for a combination of all the civilized nations of the world to arrest
and put it down. The continuance of so tremendous a curse as this, and the rum traffic,
with Africa opened, accessible on every side, to Europeans and missionaries from all
lands, with great European interests already planted there and railways introduced—is
a disgrace to the civilization of to-day. Combined Europe and America could put a
stop to it speedily. The blood of these friendless and slaughtered millions cries
aloud to Heaven; and is there no power in Christianity and in the Christian civilization
of Christendom



to avenge it and cause the horror to cease? Oh, for another Milton to thrill the nations
as did the blind bard two centuries ago when the Duke of Savoy slaughtered the Waldensians
in the valleys of Piedmont. "Cromwell flew to the rescue, raising £40,000 for the
wretched outlaws. Switzerland interfered; the King of Sweden, the Elector of Palatine,
and the Landgrave of Hesse Castle interceded," and the bloody work ceased. So would
it be in this case, if the nations interested in Africa would rouse themselves and
combine their efforts.

Says Professor Drummond:

"Do not let it be supposed that this horror is over, that this day of tribulation
is at an end. This horror and this day are now. It is not even abating. Slavery is
on the increase. Time, civilization, Christianity, are not really touching it. No
fact in relation to the slave trade is more appalling than this.

"The cause of this revived activity of the slave trade is not far to seek. It is the
normal expansion of a paying business. More men engage in it; more capital is invested
in it. The Arab never retires from business. With the prophets of his first small
caravan he equips and heads a larger one. As the years pass, his flying columns grow
larger and larger, and fiercer and fiercer. Now he can attack with impunity a region
which, in former days, he must have let alone. Formerly he fraternized and traded
with the great interior nations; now he overthrows and carries them off bodily. Having
much capital and better fire arms, he can push farther and farther into the country,
establishing depots as he goes, which become minor centers of the trade. Long ago
the Arab dared not venture beyond a limited distance from the coast line. Now he pervades
and almost dominates the continent. As one region after another is drained of its
slaves and ivory, fresh and remoter fields have to be sought out. So home after home
is made desolate, region after region is ravished, state after state is demolished,
nation after nation is mowed down like grass. Such being the state of matters in the
interior of the country, to talk of the civilization of Africa, till this butchery
is stopped, is but a mockery. . . . It is an open secret that several large and defined
markets for slaves exist in many parts of Africa and in the adjoining islands. Off
the Zanzibar coast, for instance, the extensive plantations of Pemba are wrought by
slave labor. Owing to the nature of the work and the fatal insalubrity of the climate
the death rate here is terrible, and a ceaseless traffic with the coast has to be
kept up to supply the almost daily blanks."

Says Regions Beyond:

"Cardinal Lavigerie has stated, and the statement has never been called in question,
that 400,000 slaves are annually brought to the coast of East Africa. Livingstone
reckoned that for every slave embarked from the coast, at least ten human beings had
perished, either in the capture or on the march. Many even of the number embarked
die on the voyage, or are purposely drowned—thrown overboard with stones tied to their
feet—to escape capture by the cruisers. This gives over four millions of our fellow-creatures
enslaved, tortured, or killed, year by year, continually, to gratify the inhuman greed
of gain of a few murderous Arab thieves. Is this to be suffered to go on? Cardinal
Lavigerie takes a much lower estimate, and assumes that only five perish for each
slave secured, but he is probably below the mark. The track of the slave-caravan is
marked by a line of bleaching bones. Never, in any part of the known world, or in
the pages of history, has there been such butchery and murder."

Father Bridoux, a Roman Catholic missionary, writes from the south-east coast of Lake
Tanganyika that on his journey from Mpwapwa to the lake he passed many caravans of
slaves, who were for the most part living skeletons. In spite of their miserable condition,
the men wore the slave fork on their shoulders, while the women were fastened together
in long lines by chains. All the children who could walk bore burdens in proportion
to their size. Father Bridoux tells terrible stories of finding wretched captives
who, overcome by weakness, had been left to die along the route, and who were still
alive when he saw them. The Comoro Islands, south of Zanzibar and Madagascar, have
in the pats been the destinations of many thousands of slaves captured by the Arabs
on the mainland. The Sultan Abdallah of the Comoros has now, under the influence of
Dr. Ormieres, the French Resident at his capital, issued a proclamation abolishing
slavery in his islands. He forbids the purchase and sale of slaves, and



announces that any person landing on the Comoros shall be free, whatever his previous
condition. There are about 23,000 slaves in the Comoros, who have been brought from
the mainland. March 8 the Queen of Madagascar issued a proclamation to her people,
in which she says that all slaves who are landed in her dominions shall be free when
they touch her soil. "If the natives of Africa are brought across the sea and introduced
into any part of Madagascar to be slaves, they shall not be slaves, but free subjects."

From all parts of East Africa comes the same horrible story. On his second journey
up the Congo Stanley found 118 villages, which on his first trip he had seen smiling
and prosperous, desolated, burnt, deserted! On his present expedition, in the region
between the Congo and Lake Albert, he nearly perished with all his party in consequence
of famine in the desert produced by the destructive raids of the Arabs. People, villages,
stores, fruit-trees, all were gone, enslaved, or killed, or burnt, and naked desolation
and gaunt starvation had to be faced, where human hearts and homes abounded a year
ago.

The brave words of Prof. Drummond ought to crimson our nation's cheek with shame,
and call forth a proper response to his burning question. He asks:

"What will America do to help? Time was when the United States kept a cruiser on the
West Coast of Africa to check this trade. But when the attitude of America to the
Congo treaty is remembered, and her refusal to touch the question of the exportation
to Africa of arms, ammunition and liquor,* can it be said that she keeps her place
to-day in that moral reformation of the world which is the duty and privilege of all
the foremost nations? Is it true of that Constitution of which she is so worthily
proud, that with reference to these questions, and in the words of the Prime Minister
of England: "They (the United States) have told us that, owing to the peculiarities
of their Constitution, they are not very anxious to enter into obligations with foreign
powers?" America has never been provincial. She must not become so. So manifold and
pressing are now the interests of her own great country that she might also be pardoned
if she did. But the world will be bewildered and disappointed if she separates herself
now from the rest of mankind in facing those great wrongs of humanity from which seas
cannot divide her and which her poorer brethren in every part of Europe are giving
themselves to relieve. America does well in refusing the entanglements of European
politics. Let her be careful lest she isolate herself from its humanities. None who
know her will fear for a moment that the breadth of her sympathies and the greatness
of her national heart will not continue to be shown in her sustained philanthropies,
in her joining hand to hand with the advanced nations of the earth in helping on all
universal causes which find their appeal in the world's great need and tribulation."

* The reader will remember that in the Conference in regard to the Congo Free States
treaty, our representative refused assent to the provision excluding the importation
of liquor, etc.—an eternal stigma to us!—Ed.

Thank God there are signs that the two most crying evils of the nineteenth century,
as they apply to Africa, are to receive the consideration which they demand. Two Congresses
are to meet this autumn to deal with the difficult and tremendous problem. One is
to assemble at Brussels. For more than a year the King of the Belgians has wished
to convene a Congress of the signatories to the acts of the Berlin Conference. But
the German troubles in East Africa prevented the realization last autumn of this desire.
Now most of the Great Powers have agreed to the proposal of such a Conference to be
held this coming autumn. It is to consider not only the slavery question, but the
scarcely less pressing one of the demoralization of the native races by drink; and
also that of the supply to them of arms and ammunition.

The other Conference assembles at Lucerne at the invitation of Cardinal Lavigerie
from the 3d to the 10th of August next. The Council of the Canton have granted the
use of the local "House of Commons," and invited the Convention heartily. The Convention
will, it is hoped, represent most of the experience gathered on the painful subject,
and will use



its united wisdom to discuss, devise, and recommend the practical measures most likely
to succeed in putting an end to the present horrible state of affairs. It will be
a popular Congress, composed of the lovers of God and of men—the ministers, missionaries,
philanthropists, travelers, explorers, and other benefactors of the human race. It
is hoped that by means of this conference public opinion throughout Europe will be
roused so that the governments will unite in such pacific plans as will lead to the
suppression of the trade.

"The assembling of these two great Conventions," says Regions Beyond, "is cause for
profound thanksgiving to God. The evil with which they are to grapple—the East African
slave-trade—has already assumed gigantic proportions, and is still growing greater.
Unless it can be arrested and extirpated, the civilization and Christianization of
Africa is hopeless."

Says the Christian Union:

"The British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society has for a long time past been agitating
the subject, and has done much to educate and direct public opinion in England. The
most effective and hopeful instrumentality, however, is to be found in the organization
of anti-slavery societies all over Europe—the noble work of Cardinal Lavigerie, who,
like Peter the Hermit, has gone from country to country, pleading eloquently and passionately
for the mute thousands in Africa. These anti-slavery societies are rapidly spreading
in Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and other countries, and large sums of
money are being raised through their endeavors."

It gives us great pleasure to add that the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church,
in which President Harrison is a Ruling Elder, at its recent session in this city,
directed its stated clerk to officially announce to the President of the United States
that it views with horror the present slave trade in Africa, and to inquire if some
steps cannot be taken for a co-operation of this country with European powers for
the suppression of the traffic.

The New York Evangelist adds these pertinent words to this announcement:

"It cannot be charged, under the circumstances, that this action is either premature
or too vigorous. It might have been earlier, if the public had been sooner informed
of the extent and atrocities of the slave-trade in Africa, as they are portrayed in
a recent issue of The United Presbyterian Magazine, though it might not have been
more efficient. The suggestion of our Assembly's resolution should receive prompt
and efficient action by Government if the way for it can possibly be opened. It certainly
can be opened, if instead of contenting ourselves with praying 'that Ethiopia may
soon stretch out her hands unto God,' and with sending half a dozen white missionaries
into Africa every year, we awake to efficient civil and political action under this
trumpet call of Divine Providence."
