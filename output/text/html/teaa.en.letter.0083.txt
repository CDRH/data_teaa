No. 46

United States Commercial Agency
St. Paul de Loanda 21st August 1868.

Sir

I have the honor to acknowledge
the reception of all the despatches from
the Department up to No. 24.

I was not able to take advantage
of my leave of absence last
year, but I desire to this. I find 
however some difficulty in leaving the
Commercial Agency in charge of an 
American, as Mr Frederick A. Silva the
Vice Commercial Agent has returned
to the United States, and I am the 
only American remaining here.

The speciality of the case
warrants me to suggest to the Department
the propiety of leaving the 
office in charge of Mr Robt. S. 
Newton, during my absence. This
gentleman


To Hon: Wm H. Seward 
Secretary of State
Washington




gentleman is of Scotch birth and a 
member of my Counting-house, and to 
whom I shall entrust the management
of my business during my absence.

The Department will confer
a favor to reply as early as convenient.

I have the honor
to be
Sir
Your most Obt. Sert.
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent.
