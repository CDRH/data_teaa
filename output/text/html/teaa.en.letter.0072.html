No 22

United States Commercial Agency. 
St. Paul de Loanda. June 24, 1866.

Sir,

I have the honor to 
acknowledge reception of your 
Despatches Nos 10 11 and 12 respectively.
In reply to your Despatch 
No 11 I was pleased to learn the 
satisfaction of the Department  
with my proceedings in the case 
of Baxter.

I regret that I should 
have drawn a wrong impression 
by intimating that I should 
cause Baxter to be rearrested 
for deserting the American Bark 
Governor

Hon: William H. Seward
Secretary of State
Washington.



"Governor Carver" I was acting 
in conformity with the Eleventh 
Article of the Treaty between 
Portugal and the United States 
and with the supposition that 
the said vessel would return to 
Loanda to claim him.

It fortunately happens 
from the prolonged physical 
weakness of Baxter I did not 
carry out the views expressed 
to the Department. Baxter is 
waiting for an opportunity to 
leave the Country. He still 
continues out of health.

I Have the Honor
to be
Your Most Obt. Sert.
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
