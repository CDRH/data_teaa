No. 60

Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar January 31 1889

Honorable G. L. Rives
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
the Department of my arrival
at my port on the 30th inst.
and that immediately on my
arrival, I sent my Credentials
to the Sultan who has returned
them to me, accompanied by his
Exequator.

Accordingly I have this
day received charge of the
United States Consulate at
Zanzibar.

His Majesty the Sultan
required me this morning in
audience on the course of
which he expressed himself
as much pleased with the
good relations since existing
between



between the Government of the
United States and Himself
and hopes for a continuation
of the same.

I shall be sending
an account of the conditions
of affairs by the earliest 
opportunity. Meanwhile I 
would observe that everything
is quiet in the town of Zanzibar: 
but the rebellion on the
main-land renders it unsafe
for Europeans to venture
there on business or otherwise. 
And this together
with the uncalled for blockade 
of the Coast, restricts
business, and has caused
great losses to the merchants.

I shall be sending
documents relating to the
transfer of the office by the
following mail.

I have the honor to be, Sir
Your obedient servant
Seth A. Pratt
U.S. Consul
