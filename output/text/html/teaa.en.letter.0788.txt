Philada Sept 4th 1885.

Hon Thos. F. Bayard
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Dr Sir

I submit the following
for your approval.

Having been appointed by
the President and confirmed by the Senate as
U.S. Consul to St Paul de Loando I left Phila
for my post last December. After reaching
Europe protracted ill health necessitated
my return to this country. during several
months at home, fully intending on my
recovery to health to proceed to my
destination, I notified your Department of
my convalescence, when your letter of
the 26th ult. reached me, apprising me
of the fact that the consulate at Loando
would be treated as vacant

My salary from Dec 30 1884 to Aug 26 1885
(the date of your communication) making two (2)
Quarters and 57 days amounts to $642.50.



Having been to considerable expense on my
preparation to go to Africa, and in going 
to and from Europe and having given
up my business with the intention of
remaining abroad for an indefinite time
in the service of the United States, I 
trust you will see the justice of my
claim for salary due and notify me of
your approval accordingly.

I am sir
Your obt. Servant,
Robt. H. Davis,
Late U.S. Consul.
