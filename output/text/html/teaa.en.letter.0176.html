Washington, Aug 23rd, 1862

Hon. Wm. H. Seward,
Secretary of State,

Sir,

Permit me to
state that I have been requested
and empowered by John D. Johnson
Esq., Special Commissioner of 
the Republic of Liberia, to aid
him in bringing to your
notice the wants and conditions
of the commerce between this
country and that.

The power to associate
some citizen of this country
with him, in this matter, is
stated in the within note,
as will more fully appear
on the presentation of this
communication.

I will therefore
respectfully represent that we
are ready to receive the
draft of a treaty, or to
suggest one, just as you
may elect.

The importance of a



favorable Treaty with that
young Republic, can not be
too strongly stated, it is
one of the places of refuge
and repose for the oppressed
of this land, its commerce
if developed would cut out
a deep and wide channel
to which a flood of inexpensive 
colored emigration
would flow; nor could
other nations murmur,
if we extended special
privileges to the creature
of our own effort and enterprise.

Relying on your well
honor liberality,
I remain Yours with much Respect,
James Mitchell
