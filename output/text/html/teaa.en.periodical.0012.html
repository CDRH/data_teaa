The Conference at Berlin on the West-African Question.

Daniel De Leon



[ . . . ]





This declaration constitutes an agreement on the part of all the governments adhering
to it that the commerce of each of their nations shall enjoy complete liberty in all
the region drained by the Congo and its affluents, including therewith Lake Tanganyika
and its eastern tributaries: also in the Atlantic zone lying on both sides of the
Congo basin proper between latitude 2° degrees 30' south, and the river Logé, prolonging
these lines eastward from the Atlantic until they reach the Congo basin also: in the
zone lying eastward of the Congo basin and situate between the 5th degree of north
latitude and the river Zambesi on the south and extending to the Indian Ocean on the
east. But it was expressly understood that the provisions should only apply to the
territories of any independent power in this eastward zone (like Zanzibar) after such
Government should give its assent; and the Conference powers agreed to use their influence
to obtain this consent.

[ . . . ]



The fourth and fifth of the resolutions of the Conference establish an agreement that
the two greatest commercial rivers of Western Africa, the Niger and Congo, as well
as all artificial water ways or railroads connecting their waters respectively, shall
forever remain open to the navigation and commercial use of all nations, on terms
of perfect equality. No embarrassing or discriminating regulations shall be applied;
and other national interests shall have the same liberty and rights on these rivers
as those of the possessory powers. No nation may create a monopoly on either river.
This navigation is to remain forever free and open to neutral commerce, even in time
of war.
