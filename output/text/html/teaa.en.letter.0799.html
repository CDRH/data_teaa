United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
30th September 1886

Sir

I have the honor to request
the Department to grant me leave of 
absence. I wish to take my wife to 
England in December next as I find
the climate does not agree with her,
and as I intend returning in March
next, I shall be absent only three or
four months.

I beg alas to request the Department 
to allow me the liberty to
nominate my chief clerk in my
commercial business, Mr Edward
Bannister, to act as Vice Consul 
during my absence, Mr Bent who
formerly acted being no longer in 
my



my employ and not likely to return
to Loanda.

As I have been here now nearly
twenty years I find it necessary that
I should visit a cold climate more
frequently than I have hitherto done,
and when last at home my Doctor
recommended that I should at
least try and take a run home once
a year.

In consideration of these circumstances, 
the unhealthy nature
of this locality, and the long time
I have resided here I take the liberty
to solicit the Department for a standing
permission to take leave of absence
whenever circumstances compel
my departure from this place.
This request may appear to be
a



a departure from the general
custom of the Department, but
I trust that the special nature
of the case may induce you to
take the matter into favorable
consideration.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most obedient servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul

Assistant Secretary
of State
