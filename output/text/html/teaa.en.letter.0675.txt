Department of State Received Nov 3 1884

United States Consulate
Loanda 9th September 1884.

Sir.

I have the honor to report for the information
of the Department, that, the German Frigate "Leipzig"
of 3980 Tons, 4800 Horsepower, carrying 13 guns and
commanded by Captain Otto Herbig arrived at this
port on the 17th August on her way from the China
Station, having touched at Angra Pequena. She
took in coal and proceeded on the 21st for Gaboon
where the Captain hopes to meet the Gunboat "Moewe"
with Dr Nachtigal on board or receive orders.
Receiving no orders she proceeds home.

I hear Dr Nachtigal has been making
treaties on behalf of the German Government 
at different places on the North Coat, especially
at Cameroons and the Forcados Rivers. But
I am not well enough informed to give 
particulars.

The



The German Gunboats, "Wolf" and "Moewe," (the
latter with Dr Nachtigal on board) are expected
here shortly.

I have the honor to be, Sir
Your most Obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
U.S. Vice-Consul.

The Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC.
