Hon. Wm. L Marcy
Secretary of State U.S.A.

Sir

Your circulars of Octo. 
8th '53, March 15th &amp; September 18th 54 more received since
my return from St. Paul de Loanda at which Port I
have the honor of acting as U.S. Commercial Agent. 

On my arrival I addressed the department to
that effect &amp; now advise you of my intended return 
to that port which will probably take place about
the 28th or 30th inst.

As many of the Queries in the
Circular of Octo 8th 53 &amp; Interrogatories of March 15th
'54 cannot be answered by me at the present time. I
am compelled to postpone my answer until my
return to Loanda. I much regret that I am
unable to give the desired information previous to
the close of the year 1854, but on my arrival at
Loanda I will give it my earliest attention &amp;
forward by first opportunity.

Accompaning this I forward to your
Department the Returns of the Coml Agency at
the Port of St. Paul de Loanda ending June 30 '54.

I am Sir, very Respectfully
Your obedient Servant
John G. Willis
