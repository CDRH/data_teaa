Called at the White House.

A Representative of the King of Belgium Meets the President.





Washington, Oct. 18. -- At the request of the king of Belgium, Col. Henry L. Kowalsky,
of the San Francisco bar, and a personal friend of King Leopold, called at the white
house Monday by appointment and presented the reply of the federation for the benefit
of Belgian interests abroad to attacks made on the government of the Congo Free State.
Col. Kowalsky presented to the president an autograph picture of King Leopold framed
in silver. In the course of an extended audience with the president Col. Kowalsky
said:

"Interested Britishers are endeavoring, under the guise of benefactors of the Congo
natives, to open the question of sovereignty over these regions by calling a conference
of the powers at which, it is hoped by the Britishers, England may establish the contention
that Belgium is impotent to maintain an effective government in the Congo."
