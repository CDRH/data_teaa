Sir

I had the honor in 
my despatch No 15 to place before 
the Department a full statement 
regarding a case of an alleged 
American Seaman by the name 
of Edward Baxter who deserted 
from the American Bark "Governor 
Carver" at Mossamedes, and 
accused the said vessl of 
having embarked a cargo of 
slaves at that port; for which 
failing to prove the accusation
was thrown into prison by the 
Portuguese authorities to await 
his


Hon Wm H. Seward
Secretary of State




his trial. The trial being 
delayed I requested several 
times the judicial authorities 
to have the case decided 
which took place on the 26th 
inst the trial was a short 
one his own confession proving 
him guilty of the charge 
against him. The judge applied 
to his case the most
lenient version of the law, deciding 
that the imprisonment 
he had already suffered was 
the punishment they should 
impose upon him. He was therefore 
set out at liberty, and 
presented himself to me.

I am conscious
of



of its being my duty to inflict 
upon him an additional 
punishment for deserting the 
American Bark "Governor Carver"; 
but seeing him very much 
reduced by bodily weakness from 
the hardship of a Portuguese 
prison in Africa which he 
suffered for nearly five months, 
when he had been seriously 
sick with fever on two occasions, 
humanity directed me to allow 
him to be at liberty to 
recruit his health which being 
accomplished I should cause
him to suffer a moderate 
imprisonment that he may 
have impressed upon him the 



consequences of deserting an 
American vessel in a foreign 
port without justifiable reason.

I have the honor
to be
Your Most Obedt Servt
