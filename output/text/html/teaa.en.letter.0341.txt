Lincoln, Neb. April 14th 1884

Hon. John Davis 
Assistant Secretary of State 

Sir

Your communication 
No 8 received. The enclosed draft
correct. I hasten to comply 
with your instructions and 
enclose the voucher for 
miscellaneous expense at the Agency.

My health and that of Mrs.
Campbell is very much improved 



by our sojourn in this country, and 
we are looking forward to our 
return in a few months, to our 
station in Africa. Before going 
however I wish to place before 
you the political aspect there 
as it appears to us and received 
as definite instructions as the 
case may demand. The aggressiveness 
of the French Govt  
in that part of the world, where 
there is no power to resist, and 
no one to speak for that poor 
degraded people is something very 
much to be deplored. Before 



leaving I will also ask the Department
for flag staff, flag, stationery and 
blank forms.

I am Sir,
Your obedient Servant 
Graham C. Campbell

Enclosure - Account of Miscellaneous expense.
