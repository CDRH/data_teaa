Detroit September 11, 1877.

Hon F. W. Seward,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington D.C.

Sir,

By my instructions, I am directed 
to proceed to my post at the 
expiration of thirty days from the
date of my oath of office. I find it 
impossible to arrange my business so 
soon, and beg the indulgence of the 
department for two weeks.

I am Sir, your obedient servant,
Joseph E. Jackson,
Consul at St
Paul de Loanda.
