United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
November 18th, 1881.

Sir,

Thinking the following
particular may prove of Interest,
I have the honor to lay before
the Department the following 
extracts of a letter received from
Mr W. S. Bent, an Englishman
at present at Mossamedes,
with reference to the Boers
who have lately settled at 
Humpata, under Portuguese
rule, where he visited them.

"The Boers left the Transvaal
about 5 years ago, and arrived
at a place called Humpata,
a distance of 120 miles from
Mossamedes or Little Fish Bay.
They left the Transvaal numbering
about 700 persons, men
women and children, and 
have been traversing the
Country in all directions for
5 years



5 years in the hope of hitting
upon a suitable place to gain
a reasonable likelihood. In
February 1881 they arrived at
Humpata, a place up to that
date unfrequented by the Portuguese
but appertaining to
the Province of Angola, and
decided to take up their abode
there, and have now Corn (Wheat) 
in large quantities, Potatoes and
Vegetables of all descriptions, and
intend to grow vines for the
production of Wine, and 
Cotton, as the means of gaining
their livelihood.

They number to-day 420
people about 250 of whom are
women and children, the remainder
having died on the journey.
They seem to be a very hardworking
peacible set of people,
and have placed themselves
entirely under Portuguese law
and protection, and have a 
Portuguese



Portuguese Officer and 1/2 dozen
soldiers residing amongst them
in a sort of hut termed a Fort,
where the Portuguese Flag flies.
The land is free from any tax
for 10 years. The Boers have
executed a wonderful piece
of work in the shape of a
canal, the ingenuity of which
the Portuguese marvel at, they
having brought water into the
place, which was the first thing
they did after they settled, bringing
it from a distance of 3 1/4 miles,
and now a running stream of 
pure Iron water passes by the
front of each house. There are
44 different houses to-day, the
construction of all of which
being very similar, having a
thatched roof and walls composed
of stone sand and clay.
The land of Humpata is pretty
fertile, and Copper and Iron
abounds in large quantities, but
no



no person has troubled themselves
as yet about either.

Lions, Leopards, Elephant,
Camel, Wolf, Ostrich, Giraffe,
Hippopotamus, Aligator, Wild
Goat, and many beautiful birds
are found in great abundance
close to this district, and the
Boers have every hopes of being
able to carry on a good business
in the export of Ivory and
Ostrich feathers to England
and the Cape. They have about
70 Horses and 2500 head of
Cattle, but are losing day by
day horses and bullocks, owing
to the scarcity of proper pasture.
the natives (Gambos) being in the 
habit of daily setting fire in 
all parts to the good grass.

The Boers have frequently
complained to the Governor of 
Mossamedes, Senhor Sebastias
Runes de Matta, but up to 
date that gentleman has not 
been



been able to move in the matter,
except in two cases where the
natives had to compensate the 
Boers for the death of 4 bullocks,
and where the Boers received
compensation in Cattle from
the natives for having willfully
stabbed several valuable horses.

The Tribe of the Gambos
have attacked the Boers on two 
different occassions, with the
view to driving them out of the
place, but repulsed; and the
Gambos are now gradually
settling down to the idea that
they must submit to the "White-dogs,"
as they call them, having
taken possession of part of their 
country.

The Portuguese Goverment
has arranged with the Boers to 
to give them £2,500 for the purpose
of opening a Carriage road from 
Humpata to Little Fish Bay
and



and the Boers commenced the
work on the 20th September last.
This work I hear was calculated
by some Portuguese Engineers
to cost about £20,000.

It is calculated that the
road will take 6 months to 
make, when the Boer's will
have communication by Cars
with the Merchants in the Bay.
At present it is impossible to 
travel by Car, the only way 
being by Hammock or on
Horse-back, there being at about
4 Leagues from Humpata, a very 
steep ascent called Shella, the
only available passage, and
where no person can ascend on
horse-back, or even in a Hammock
but is obliged to ascend on
foot, the ascent taking 3 1/2 hours.

The water in this
district (Shella and Bruco)
is beautiful, there being such a 
quantity of Iron in the district,
and



and it is even better in Humpata
and Huilla, the latter place being
about 18 to 20 miles S.E. of Humpata.

The writer, the first Englishman
who has visited the colony of the
Boers, was wonderfully well received,
and was able to give them
all the news of the War in the
Transvaal, and the news he communicated
to them of the conclusion
of the War created great excitement,
and for 24 hours after, succeeded
a series of thanksgiving's to the
Almighty for having brought
to a conclusion such an unhappy
War. Almost all these people
had relations who fought in
the War, and up to date do
not know who was killed or
saved, they having had all
their letters stopped since the 
commencement. It is not known 
where this happened.

Humpata is a most
healthy locality, and at this 
time



time of the year (November) is 
almost as cold as November in
England. It lies in a valley
almost entirely surrounded by
rocky mountains, the country
on all sides for 3 Leagues being 
mountainous. The name of the
Commander is Josephius F. Botha,
and the secretary Peter J. Botha.
Each man is supposed to have
about £50 in English Gold Coin 
to-day and his horse, and they
are said to have altogether
about £7,000 

It is expected that another
Colony will shortly arrive termed
by the Boers, Bastards, being
the children of a Boer Father
and a Hottentot Mother. They
number some 1000 people, and it
is reported by a Swedish hunter,
that they intend to travel down
here, with a view to settling
about 20 Leagues S.E. of Humpata
with the same intention as the Boers.
These"



These people at present are said
to be near Cape Town, but are being
driven away into the interior
through the English farmers
there buying ground daily.

The Portuguese hold great
expectations from the Establishment
of the Boers at Humpata on
account of the export of Ivory,
Feathers, and Cotton, and the 
production of Wine and Flour."

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most Obedient Servant
Robt S Newton
Vice Consul.

To the 
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
