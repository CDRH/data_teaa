Memorandum on Christian Missions in Africa at the Peace Conference.

(1) This Memorandum is submitted by the Standing Committee of the Conference of Missionary
Societies in which the missionary organizations of all the Christian bodies in Great
Britain and Ireland other than the Roman Catholics are officially represented.

(2) The General Act of the Conference of Berlin in 1885 contains an article providing
in explicit terms for freedom of conscience and religious toleration and for liberty
for Christian missions to carry on their work in the parts of Africa covered by the
Act. The full text of the article is quoted in an appendix. The Standing Committee
of the Conference of Missionary Societies desire to represent to His Majesty's Government
that in the event of any international agreement with reference to the future government
of tropical Africa being reached at the Peace Conference the rights and liberties
secured to Christian missions under the Berlin Act should be conserved. The Committee
are confident that Christian public opinion in Great Britain and America will expect
that in the endeavours of the Peace Conference to lay the foundations of a new order
based on justice and right the disinterested and beneficent work of Christian missions
on behalf of the native races of Africa will not be placed/ 



placed in a less favourable position than that accorded to it by the Berlin Act.

3. The Committee are aware of the practical difficulties arising out of the war in
reaffirming the Article of the Berlin Act in its present form. They do not regard
all the provisions of the Article as essential. Having given careful thought to the
subject they desire to submit a statement of their views of the course that might
reasonably be adopted in conformity with the declared policy of His Majesty's Government
and of other governments with reference to Christian missions. While other Powers
have at different times entered into treaties guaranteeing religious toleration and
freedom for the work of Christian missions, reference is made here, for the sake of
brevity, only to the policy of the American and British Governments. 

Policy of the American Government.

(4) The general policy of the Government of the United States in regard to missionaries
and missionary questions is set forth in a statement from the Solicitor for the Department
of State in Washington communicates to the World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh
in 1910, and printed in Volume VII of the Report of that Conference (pp.123-34). A
summary of the policy as expressed in treaties and correspondence between the United
States and other Powers is given in the following quotation:

"The policy of the United States is that missionaries and merchants stand upon an
equality in the eye of 
the law; that every man, whether he be preacher or 



or man of affairs, is first of all a citizen of the United States, and, as such, entitled
to protection to his person and property so far as international law permits, and
the right, whether he be tradesman or churchman, to follow his calling. Just as the
United States has entered into innumerable commercial treaties in order to secure
for American industry and commerce in foreign parts equal rights and privileges with
the native, so the United States has entered into treaties with various countries
by the terms of which American missionaries are specifically granted the right to
reside within the territory, to acquire property necessary for their mission, and
to preach the Gospel to natives, provided that this be done without seeking to disturb
the political organisation of the country in which they reside."

Policy of His Majesty's Government.

(5) The policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to Christian missions has recently
been the subject of discussion between the Government and the Conference of Missionary
Societies in Great Britain and Ireland. As the result of these discussions the Government
has drawn up memoranda embodying its policy. The memoranda in their present form deal
only with India, but it is understood that the same policy will be applied to other
parts of the Empire. This statement of policy has received the approval of the Conference
of Missionary Societies. The main features of this policy are the following:

(a) The/



(a) The services of Christian missions in protect the material and moral welfare of
polulations under British rule are recognised and their co-operatives in the future
welcomed in the opening paragraph of the memoranda in the following terms:

"Appreciating to the full the value of the work done in the past by missionary and
other philanthropic societies and organisations, His Majesty's Government and the
Government of India cordially welcome their co-operation in the future in furthering
the moral and material well-being of the peoples of India."

(b) So far as Great Britain and America are concerned the policy rests upon the voluntary
co-operation of the Conference of Missionary Societies in Great Britain and Ireland
and of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America with His Majesty's Government.
The Conference will submit to the Government lists of "recognised" societies which
they believe to be prepared to assume, and to be capable of exercising, responsibility
for the control of their missionaries. No restrictions will be imposed on missionaries
of these societies. Missionaries of societies that are not "recognised" must obtain
a permit from the Government authorising them to carry on their work. In any question
that may arise between His Majesty's Government and any recognised society or member
of such society the Government will address the Conference, who will use their good
offices to regulate the affair.

In regard to Roman Catholic missions, His Majesty's Government will  Cardinal Archbishop
of/



of Westminster who will in the same way recommend to His Majesty's Government a list
of "recognised" societies.

(c) In the interests of public security missionaries of alien enemy nationality are
excluded for a period to be defined hereafter and missionaries of other nationalities
than British or American must obtain a permit authorising them to carry on their work.
These restrictions, however, are based on the abnormal conditions created by the war
and the way is left open for their removal and for the extension of the principle
of freedom and of the voluntary co-operation of missionary bodies with His Majesty's
Government when political conditions justify it. 

Proposals in regard to Africa.

(6) It is in the view of the Standing Committee of the Conference of Missionary Societies
essential that any new international agreement that may be reached in regard to the
future of tropical Africa should contain provisions guaranteeing freedom of conscience
and religious toleration and securing to both natives and foreigners freedom from
interference in the exercies of their religion and from any political or civil disability
on the ground of their religious beliefs or in consequence of a change of faith.

(7) The Committee are further of opinion that Christian missions are entitled to claim
that the services which they have rendered in the past to the cause/ 



cause of education and civilisation should be recognised by the Powers and their co-operation
in the future in promoting the material and moral well-being of the natives of Africa
should be explicitly welcomed. This claim they believe to be justified on the following
grounds:

(a) The position already secured to Christian missions under the Berlin Act:

(b) the fact that the education of the natives of Africa has up to the present been
mainly the work of Christian missions and the further services rendered by them in
the exploration and opening up of the continent, in linguistic science, in the study
of the customs and habits of the people and in the advancement of civilisation generally;
and

(c) because the disinterested work of Christian missions on behalf of the natives
of Africa is a valuable support to the principle of trusteeship which is the acknowledged
basis of British policy in the government of subject races and which it is hoped will
be embodied in the constitution of the League of Nations to be established at the
Peace Conference.

(8) The Committee recognise that it may be necessary in consequence of the war to
impose temporary restrictions upon missions of certain nationalities. So long as such
restrictions are imposed as temporary and exceptional measures rendered necessary
by abnormal conditions, they are not in conflict with the principle of freedom for
missionary work which must be the basis of/



of any policy that will satisfy Christian public opinion in Great Britain and America.


(9) Governments may justly claim that missionaries of foreign nationality admitted
to work in their territories should abstain from all interference in the political
organization of the country. The missionary societies represented in the British and
American Conferences are willing to give voluntarily to any foreign government in
whose territory they may be working a declaration recognising that all the obedient
and respect should be given to the lawfully constituted government and that while
carefully abstaining from political affairs it is their desire and purpose that their
influence, so far as it may be properly exerted in such matters, should be so exerted
in loyal co-operation with the government of the country concerned and that they will
only employ agents who will work in this spirit. It is believed that missionary societies
in other countries would be equally willing to give such an undertaking.

(10) It is recognised that it may sometimes be right and necessary for governments
to impose temporary restrictions on missionary work in the interests of public order
and security: and, further, that the necessity may occasionally arise of restraining
the activities of indiscreet individuals, more particularly of those who are not the
agents of some responsible missionary organization. It is submitted that if difficulties
should arise in connection with these or other matters involving the relations of
missons/



missions with governments any differences that may exist can best be adjusted by friendly
discussion between responsible missionary bodies and the government concerned.

The settlement of such differences has been made easier by the growth in recent years
of a missionary organization adapted to the purpose. There are now in Great Britain
and America conferences in which all the important missionary organizations in each
country, other than Roman Catholic, are represented. Similar organizations exist in
some of the countries on the continent of Europe and there are links, which may be
expected to become closer in the future, between Protestant missions on the continent
and the conferences in Great Britain and America. There are further, in the principal
mission fields, local conferences representing all the missions working in each area.
These bodies which in the mission fields are composed of the most experienced missionaries
and at home include responsible leaders in the different churches and men experienced
in public affairs, may be relied upon not to put forward or support unreasonable claims.
A more detailed statement of this missionary organization is given in an appendix.

It is respectfully submitted that the voluntary co-operation of these responsible
missionary bodies with governments furnishes and adequate and sufficient means of
dealing with any difficulties which may arise and may be expected to result in an
increasing understanding/



understanding between missions and governments and in their more effective co-operation,
each in their own proper sphere, in promoting the welfare of the native races of Africa.

(11) The Standing Committee of the Conference of Missionary Societies have not sufficient
information regarding the probable action of the Peace Conference with reference to
tropical Africa to justify them in making definite proposals. But for the sake of
clearness and to indicate the practical bearing of the views expressed in this memorandum
they suggest that, in the event of a new international agreement being substituted
for the Berlin Act, it should include an article to the following effect:

"Freedom of conscience and religious toleration are guaranteed both to natives and
foreigners. The followers of all religions shall be free from interference in the
exercise of their religion and from any political or civil disability on the ground
of their religious beliefs or in consequence of a change of faith.

"The Powers appreciate the value of the work done in the past by Christian missions
and cordially welcome their co-operation in the future in promoting the moral and
material well-being of the peoples of Africa. Subject to such restrictions as they
may find it necessary in consequence of the war to impose for a period on missions
of certain nationalities, the right of missions to teach the Christian religion, to
acquire and hold property and/



and to erect buildings for missionary purposes is recognised."
