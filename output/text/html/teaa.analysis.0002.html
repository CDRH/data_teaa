Article Analysis

Curaçao-born, Jewish intellectual Daniel De Leon joined the Socialist Party in 1890
while in the United States. He began working with the American Federation of Labor,
but in 1895, left the group to form the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance.1 A noted
Socialist scholar, De Leon offers an anti-imperialist, Socialist interpretation of
the Berlin Conference, in which he provides historical background to what he called
the "West-African Question." De Leon considers the Berlin Conference "an event unique
in the history of political science," because it brought together all the "important
powers" of Europe—except Greece and Switzerland—and the United States. More importantly,
he argues that the conference was purely motivated by economics, despite its pretensions
at being a diplomatic gathering, serving the interests of German Chancellor Bismarck
and Germany to not only secure trade rights in West Africa, but also to find land
for German settlers.2

De Leon's article offers a detailed history of the African Question that takes into
account the role of Spain and Portugal in establishing sustained contact with West
Africa in the fifteenth century. As De Leon points out, Portugal proclaimed "inchoate
rights of ownership" over the Congo (Zaire) River and most of the West African coast
based on the right of discovery which was upheld by the papacy. Portuguese trade dominance
in the region went relatively unchallenged for nearly 400 years, however, in the nineteenth
century, as Europeans increased their exploration of Africa after the abolition of
the slave trade, Portugal's near trade monopoly in the region was challenged. The
Berlin Conference, in effect, divested Portugal of its control over the navigation
of the Congo River.





Excerpt Analysis



Cabinda was an Atlantic coast port city located at the mouth of the Congo River. Beginning
in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese—followed by the Dutch and the English—established
trading posts in the city. European merchants traded for palm oil and enslaved Africans,
and Cabinda became integral to the Atlantic trade. In the nineteenth century, Cabinda
rejected the slave trade and began engaging in "legitimate" trade led by resident
merchants, most notably Chico Franque, a Brazilian trader. In 1883, the governor of
Angola sent Guilherme de Brito Capelo to occupy Cabinda and Massabi. Both cities lay
on the north coast of the Congo River, and King Leopold II claimed the Portuguese
possessions as part of his Congo Free State. During the Berlin Conference, the Portuguese
argued strongly for their rights to Cabinda which the General Act of the Berlin Conference
recognized in 1885. Cabinda became a Portuguese enclave surrounded by the French Congo
and the Congo Free State, however, as the above excerpt attests, the French were not
satisfied with this disposition. While the 1885 Treaty of Simulambuco established
the Portuguese Congo—of which Cabinda was a part—it was the Franco-Portuguese Convention
of May 12, 1886 that drew the boundaries between the French possessions in the region
and Portuguese Cabinda.3






The Portuguese—led by the governor of Angola, José Coelho do Amaral—seized Ambriz
in 1855. A port town under African rule, Ambriz had access to the Loge River, which
flows directly into the Atlantic Ocean. After the Portuguese occupation of the town,
Ambriz and Luanda served as the main ports for Portuguese trade and constituted part
of the buffer zone that separated the Portuguese kingdom of Angola from the indigenous
kingdom of Kongo. After the General Act of the Berlin Conference declared the Loge
River the southern boundary of the Congo Basin, Ambriz benefited from the Angolan
rubber and coffee trade as well as its proximity to the Congo Free State.4 As this
excerpt highlights, France and Portugal clashed over the boundaries of their colonies,
territories, and protectorates in West Africa. Like the British and the Dutch, the
French argued for extending their trade to Ambriz on the Loge River, which De Leon
mistakenly refers to as the Ambriz River.






Cape Padron is located on the left bank at the mouth of the Congo River. Named by
the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cam (or Diogo Cão) in 1484, the cape gave the Portuguese
direct access to the Congo (Zaire) River. On May 4, 1493, Pope Alexander VI issued
the Papal Bull "Inter Caetera," which gave Spain rights to claim and exploit the Americas
based on the country's first "discovery" of a land unpopulated by Christians. This
document laid the groundwork for the "doctrine of discovery," which Portugal used
to solidify its claim to exclusive trading rights with Africa, as it was the first
European nation to navigate the African coast from the Azores to Zanzibar from the
late fourteenth century to the turn of the sixteenth century.5 Portugal attempted
to maintain their claim of sovereignty over the area north of Cape Padron and the
Congo River, however the General Act of the Berlin Conference required free navigation
of the Congo, which opened up the cape to other European "powers."






Located on the Congo River, Noki (also spelled Nokki) was a European trading post
that fell under Belgian control in 1884. The General Act of the Berlin Conference
recognized Portuguese control over "legitimate" trade in that region as far inland
as Noki. It was the "principal port" in the Portuguese side of the Congo River and
had been an important stop on the caravan trade from the coast to the kingdom of Kongo.6






In 1472, Portuguese explorer Fernão do Pó became the first European to spot the island
of Bioko (or Bioco) and the coast of present-day Cameroon. The Portuguese claimed
Bioco as a colony and renamed it Fernando Po after the explorer. The island served
as a base for Portuguese participation in the Atlantic trade, including the slave
trade. In the eighteenth century, Portugal ceded the island to Spain to settle a dispute
over territory in South America. Through the Treaty of El Pardo in 1778, the Spanish
gained control of not only Fernando Po, but also the island of Annobó and trading
rights in the Gulf of Guinea. From 1827-1834, the British used the island as a base
to combat the slave trade along the Guinea Coast. During that period, missionaries
and formerly enslaved Jamaicans settled on the island, and shortly thereafter, Africans,
Europeans, and Creoles began cultivating cocoa. By the 1880s, the island experienced
a "cocoa boom."7 DeLeon suggests that when the Berlin Conference convened, Fernando
Po had become an important entrepôt for maritime traders seeking access to the interior
of Africa. Chancellor Bismarck clearly wanted to "profit" from the location of the
island to foster trade with Africans on the Atlantic Coast and the interior via the
Congo River and its tributaries that emptied into the ocean.
