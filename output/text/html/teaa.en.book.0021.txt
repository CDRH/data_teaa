A Nubian Face on the Nile.






One night we touched the lily shore,
And then passed on, in night indeed,
Against the far white waterfall.
I saw no more, shall know no more
Of her for aye. And you who read
This broken bit of dream will smile,
Half vexed that I saw aught at all.



The waves struck strophes on the shore
And all the sad song of the oar
That long, long night against the Nile,
Was: Nevermore and nevermore
This side that shadowy shore that lies
Below the leafy Paradise.
