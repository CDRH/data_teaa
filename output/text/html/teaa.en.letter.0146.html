United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
June 29th 1882.

The Hon. J. C. Bancroft Davis
Asst. Secretary of State
Washington D.C.


Sir

I have the honor most respectfully
to request that the U.S. Govt. may
furnish this consulate with a boat
oars and sail. My reasons for asking
such are: that a boat here is the most
essential piece of furniture this Consulate
could have, as to travel by land to the
places under this jurisdiction, in a
Hammock cost too much, and being
a seafearing man, I will be able to
manage a boat to any point of my 
Consular supervision with more speed
and less expenses, when such is required
for the benefits of Americans and the
govt I have the honor to represent here.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
L. de R. du Verge
U.S. Consul
