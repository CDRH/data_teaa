Vice Consulate of the United States,
Loanda, March 29, 1893.

Honorable
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

Some months ago a rumour got
about and came to my ears that the
U.S. Government had decided to abolish
the Loanda Consulate. This rumour
shortly took form in the departure of Mr
Chatelaine, Commercial Agent.

2. I have not as yet received any
others intimation as to the abolishment
of this Consulate, officially or otherwise.

My Commission from the United
States govt. as Vice-Consul is dated
July 17, 1890 and is endorsed with
my Exequatur from the King of
Portugal dated 16 Sept. 1891.

I had to give a Board for $2000
on my appointment, and I would
respectfully request you to inform
me



me if my post as Vice-Consul
is abolished, and if so why my
Bond has not been returned to me.

If you cannot get more
courteous and suitable people
to represent you here than Mr. Chatelaine
it would be as well you should
keep this Consulate closed.

I am
Sir
Your obedient servant
Ed Bannister
U.S. Vice Consul.
