your notice the fact, that American
Commerce has been very much 
depressed on the West Coast of Africa
by the countenance of  War Tax
of one cent gold new pound weight on
Groundnuts or Ground Peas.

tax was imposed during the
Rebellion of the Southern States -
the high prices  current in the 
United States for this article enables
Importers to pay it easily, but now 
prices rule very low and this duty
amounts

To the Honorable
Hamilton Fish
Secretary of State

amounts virtually to a prohibition.
American Goods can be imported
via France and England and
bartered for Ground Nuts to better

United States and bartered for 
Groundnuts to be imported here in 
return.

I am Sir
Your the obedient Servant
