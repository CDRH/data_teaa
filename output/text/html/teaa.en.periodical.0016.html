Missions Established — Anglo-Portuguese.





London, Sept. 22 — Henry M. Stanley's lecture in the Chamber of Commerce on "The Congo:
Its Past History, Present Development and Future Commercial Prospects," was listened
to by an audience whose houses represent a business of not less than $250,000,000
per annum.

The chair was occupied by Mr. Tritton, of the Lombard street banking house of Barclay,
Bevan, Tritton &amp; Co. Mr. Tritton introduced the lecturer in a highly eulogistic speech,
in which he referred to various noteworthy incidents in his adventurous career, and
especially to his labors in the cause of science, commerce and civilization.

Mr. Stanley, on advancing to the table, met with an enthusiastic reception, the heartiness
of which evidently surprised and gratified him. After dwelling briefly upon the earliest
known history of the Congo, the lecturer proceeded to give particulars of the work
of the International African Association, for which he claims the credit of being
the pioneer of civilization in the Congo districts.

Stanley says that in 1872 he wrote a letter from Fleet street to a friend at Banano
Point, on the Congo, pointing out to him that there was a field for commerce in the
great basin of the Congo, which he (Stanley) proposed to open up to the world. he
also indicated to his friend the region he proposed to develop, namely, between Mboma
and Stanley Pool. In 1874 and 1879 he explored the broad natural highway from the
west coast of Africa. He found a race of natives who were willing to trade with merchants
who dealt fairly on the basis of blood and brotherhood. When he returned to Europe
he found several schemes under consideration for exploring the district, of which
that of the African Association proved to be the most useful. Stanley Pool was gained
by treaties made with natives, who ceded to the African Association sovereignty of
the land, and the association thereupon entered upon its peaceful possession. After
entering into possession, the association invited the nations of the world to come
and trade, irrespective of nationalities. [Applause.] On returning to Stanley Pool,
he (Stanley) found that an Anglo-Portuguese treaty had been concluded. The Portuguese
said: "No; we will not allow this; we founded Congo. To maintain our superiority we
must obtain a lien upon all goods imported from Manchester." The goods, said Stanley,
were beads, wire etc. To this the association replied that they had spent nearly £500,000
sterling upon the basin of the Congo, and wished to extend further their communication
along the basin. Whatever possessions, privileges and immunities the association possessed
they wished to give it away for the benefit of bonafide travelers, the missionaries
and agriculturists. The association demanded of the Portuguese that he (Stanley) be
allowed to travel from England to Stanley Pool without any further trouble or expense
than regular passage money. The association also protested against the right of the
Portuguese to tax them for giving away money freely to philanthropic work, whereof
no one connected with the African Association ever expected to receive one penny in
interest. Stanley, continuing, sketched the history of the Congo River from the discovery
of its mouth by the Portugese navigator, Diego, 400 years ago, by the time of the
expulsion of the Portuguese by the natives, in 1630. In 1873 Lieutenant Grandy, of
the Livingston search expedition, passed through San Salvador, at the mouth of the
Congo River. Five years later, Stanley stated, he had himself arrived there. Protestant
missions were afterward formed. The English Baptist Society succeeded in establishing
a mission near the ruins of an old Catholic mission house. There was no historical
evidence on the banks of the Congo River to prove that the Portuguese ever possessed
any political establishment there whatever. Stanley said further that there is not
one single proof that the Portuguese ere erected any fort, government building or
office upon the banks of the Congo. Dutch, English and French merchants made that
river a commercial mart. 





Area of the Congo Country.

A few Portuguese traders in 1877 were there, but merely as commission agents for large
Dutch and English firms, which held the principal trade of the place. Imports to the
Congo country in 1882 amounted to £884,000 and exports to £1,856,400 sterling. The
area of the Congo country which supplies the exports is about 15,000 square miles;
navigable portion of the river only 110 miles, and coast line 160 miles. At the head
of navigation the Congo was not obstructed, and before navigation of the river would
be again possible for commerce it would be necessary to travel 235 miles to where
is situated the settlement of Leopoldsville on Stanley Pool. For fifty miles of this
distance there exists a ready and willing trade, they having something to barter which
is needed in Europe. Beyond Leopoldsville there is 3,000 miles of river penetrating
an area of 330,000 square miles, the 235 miles separating traders. The lower Congo
is impassable, and exploration is inpracticable. Stanley characterizes the colonial
policy of the Portuguese as detrimental and constrictive. he said if the claims of
the Portuguese Government were allowed by Europe all enterprise in the Congo would
be arrested. The most eager philanthropists would be sickened of the idea of sending
one through to the civilization of the Congo country. [Hear! Hear!] Commerce cannot
be extended into a new-born region like the Congo basin unless it were relieved of
all fear of that dread Portuguese tariff. Portugal does not understand the art of
colonizing. Stanley then described the rise and progress of the African Association.
Its constitution, he stated, was being prepared by eminent men, and when completed
would be published as the "Constitution of the Free States of the Congo." The name
of title then given would replace that now known as the African Association.





The Anglo-Portugese Treaty.

Mr. Stanley expressed his satisfaction at the collapse of the Anglo-Portuguese Congo
treaty which, had it been ratified would have handed over the commerce and the immense
impossibilities of the Congo to Portuguese civilization, which he could compare to
nothing but a withered and fruitless tree. He reiterated his belief in the enormous
future development of trade in the Congo region, which is fitted to yield and receive
products and merchandise to the extent of fill ions of pounds per annum. To realize
these possibilities, however, channels of commerce must be provided, and he predicted
that the Congo trade would be trivial in comparison to what it might be made, until
a portage railway was built to connect the upper and lower stretches of the river
and avoid the falls.
