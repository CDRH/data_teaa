Leopold's Present to New York





King Leopold of Belgium, who controls the Congo Free State, (so-called) has made a
present to America consisting of samples of everything grown, produced, or found in
the Congo. The exhibit is to be established in Manhattan Square, New York. Some of
the newspapers think this is a sly way this venal and unscrupulous old sovereign has
a placating public sentiment which has crystalized very thoroughly against him, because
of the reputation he has made both for personal immorality, and the atrocious deeds
he has allowed to go on against the Negroes of the Congo Free State; many of whom
now carry handless arms and branded bodies because they refused or could not give
to Leopold's agents all the ivory and gold they asked for. We might take Leopold's
gift and install it along side of the pictures of these poor people whom he has so
cruelly treated.
