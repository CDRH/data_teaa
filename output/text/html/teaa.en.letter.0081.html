Sir

I have the honor to enclose 
for the information of the Department 
a copy of my official letter to Mr. 
George E Miller master of the 
American Ship "Wm Cummings" of 
Philadelphia, now at this port.

Mr Miller does not as yet 
feel disposed to comply with my demand 
I therefore hold his ship's 
papers until he does.

I am now preparing full 
accounts of this case to forward to the 
Department per "Ionic" now loading 
for Boston, when the Department 
will learn of the justifiable 
causes which influenced my official 
action


The Hon: William H Seward

Sir

Having thoroughly examined the 
whole of your ship's company including 
yourself and officers, on a charge of 
ill treatment and cruelty, lodged against 
yourself and chief officer by your crew. 
I consider the evidence of sufficient 
consequence to justify me in discharging 
your entire crew of sailors, twelve 
in number; I therefore request, in 
conformity with consular regulations, 
that you repair to this Commercial 
Agency and deposit the balance of 
their wages and also three months 
extra pay to each man.

I have the honor 
to be
Your Mo Obt Sert
(Sg) Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent

Master of the American
Ship "Wm Cummings"
