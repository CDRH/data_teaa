No. 123.

Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar December 14 1889

Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir

I have the honor to advise 
the Department of the
arrival at Zanzibar on
the 6th inst of Mr. Stanley
and the Emin Relief Expedition.

Emin Pasha unfortunately
met with quite a serious
accident immediately after
the banquet given by the
Germans at Bagamayo and
it has not been deemed
advisable to have him
removed to Zanzibar.

Mr Stanley is the  
guest of the British Consul
General and the Emin Relief
Committee and has been
shown every attention



a reception rendered him
last evening at the British
Consulate General was largely
attended and was a 
success.

It is expected that Mr.
Stanley with his  will
take his departure from
Zanzibar about the 25th inst.
by one of the  Steamers
that is coming here to
convey Emin's people to 
Egypt. It is hoped that
Emin Pasha will be able
to go at the same time
but it is considered doubtful 
if he can be moved
with safety.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
Seth A. Pratt
U.S. Consul
