Department of State,
Monrovia, Liberia,
Feby 16th 1898

Sir

The bearer of this letter Bishop 
Hartzel is in the confidence of this Government, 
and we have availed ourselves of the 
opportunity afforded by his visit to the 
United States, to ask him to have an interview 
with Your Honor in the interest of 
this Republic and to point out the 
reasons that led us to transmit to you 
our despatch under date of 14th of August 
last asking the negotiation of a Treaty 
on the part of the United States of America
and Great Britain, which will guarantee
the independence of this Republic.

Very recently events have transpired
which convince us of the importance 
of the effort we are putting forth in that 
direction, a full statement of which Bishop 
Hartzel will disclose to you.

With distinguished considerations, 
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obdt. Servant,
G. W. Gibson 
Secretary of State.

Hon John Sherman,
Secretary of State, U.S.A.
Washington, D.C.
