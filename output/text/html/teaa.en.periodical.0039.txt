[By the Associated Press -- P.M.]

Washington, Oct. 17. -- Henry L. Kowalsky of San Francisco, one of the attorneys in
this country for the Belgian government today presented to the President a message
from the King of Belgium and in answer on the part of the Belgian government to the
memorial laid before the President recently by E. D. Morel, honorary secretary of
the Congo Relief Association. Mr. Kowalsky later had a conference with the officials
of the State Department.

He declares that an effort is being made to make the American government a catspaw
in the Congo affair, and he does not believe it will be successful.

In an interview with the Associated Press. Mr. Kowalsky said:

"I presented to the President a letter from King Leopold in reply to the baseless
charges of the British humanitarians and also other documents stating the Belgian
side of the controversy.

"The testimony of travelers, from the days of Sir Henry M. Stanley to the present
time, is unanimous and emphatic in praise of the Congo Free State government. If it
were necessary to disprove such inconsistent and palpably false charges as those which
try to make it appear that the Belgian officers in the Congo chop off the hands of
the blacks whom they are trying to enslave we could bring the statements of such eye
witnesses as Maj. James Harrison, Sir Harry Johnston, Mr. Grenfell, Capt. M. D. Bell
and Michael Holland, themselves all Englishmen, who assert that the Congo Free State
is far more advanced in civilization than British East Africa and Uganda. Cardinal
Gibbons has given his testimony also regarding the great work performed by King Leopold
in Africa.

"I have also called to the President's attention the fact that all this uproar in
England over the atrocities in the Congo is fathered by missionaries whose applications
for big concessions were turned down by the Belgian authorities. Not a single charge
of cruelty, as I said to the President, has been made except by those who have been
seeking material advantages in that region. I told him that this fact and the fact
that Great Britain has failed in her effort to open up the Congo question accounts
for the attempt now being made to work upon the sympathies of the American people
by trumped-up stories of cruelty to the Congo natives.

Cordially Received.

Mr. Kowalsky was cordially received by the President, who expressed his pleasure that
King Leopold had thus honored an American. After the matter had been carefully considered
by the President and Secretary Hay, a reply will be made to the Congo Reform Association.

After his visit to the White House, Mr. Kowalsky sent a cablegram to King Leopold,
assuring him of the President's appreciation of His Majesty's thoughtful consideration.

King Leopold, in his letter to Mr. Kowalsky, a copy of which was left with the President,
encloses a statement about the Congo from the Federation for the Defense of Belgian
Interests Abroad, and says [illegible] You will, in delivering this communication
to the President [illegible] to him on my behalf the feelings of esteem I have for
him and the unshaken confidence I place in his spirit of justice and impartiality.

"I have to express the desire that Mr. Roosevelt will kindly take cognizance of this
address in your presence so that you may be afforded an opportunity to give him any
further information he might wish to obtain from you. 

"The foundation and fairness of the case which you have been good enough to undertake
will supply you with such numerous and conclusive arguments as to confound the enemies
of the Congo Free State."
