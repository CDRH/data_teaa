The Return of the Exiles.

A Lecture Delivered at Lagos, West Africa, January
2, 1892, by Prof. Edward W. Blyden, L.L. D.





It affords me great pleasure to stand before you to-night to
greet for the first time a Lagos audience; and, if your Excellency*
will permit me to say so, I feel it a special privilege to have come
to this settlement during your administration, and while you are.
stimulating an enterprise upon which alone, among many 
agencies, I believe that the rapid regeneration and permanent
prosperity of Africa depend; I mean the Repatriation of the Exiles
from the Western Hemisphere. And it is a source of further
gratification to me to know that in your efforts in this direction
you are supported by a band of officials, foreign and native, who
share in your sagacious appreciation of that great work, and do
everything to render efficient co-operation in all the statesmanlike
schemes for the good of the country and the people which you
are endeavoring to carry out.

As I intimated a few days ago to a committee of gentlemen
whom I had the honor to receive, I look upon Lagos as one of
the most hopeful spots in West Africa. Notwithstanding all I
had heard of the developments here I was taken by most 
exhilarating surprise when I entered the lagoon and witnessed the
evidences of material growth before me—the result of only thirty
years of peaceful and judicious administration.

As I gazed with something like rapture at the scene, I was 
reminded of some of the cities in the Southern States of America
which I visited a year ago, especially Charleston, South Carolina,

* Governor Sir Alfred Moloney, K. C. M. G.



and Jacksonville, Florida, though the advantage seemed to me
far and away in favor of Lagos, considering the remote date of
the origin of those cities compared to that of this "Liverpool of
West Africa." And when I landed and saw the inhabitants the
comparison was still suggested by the large population of unmixed
Africans. The cities of Charleston and Jacksonville, from the
color of the people who throng their streets, may be called
African cities in America; and from its business-like appearance,
as well as the novelty of everything-the newness of its 
improvements—Lagos might be called an American city in Africa.

But I was very much struck by the difference in the general
bearing of the people here. They resembled their brethren
across the sea in nothing but their color. While it is true that
the only original thing produced in the Southern States—that
which may be said to be most distinctly American—is the music
of the exiles, still there is, in spite of their inexhaustible melody,
an evident air of depression and unrest about them—a sullen 
acquiescence in their surroundings. Although they have charmed
the ears and melted the hearts of nobles and crowned heads in
Europe by their unparalleled gift of song, yet for them the keynote 
of their music is degradation and despair. They are exiles
kept in perpetual dread, carrying about with them the marks of
their besetting and obtrusive infirmities. Their constant and
pervading feeling is that of the character in Wordsworth:

My apprehensions come in crowds;
I dread the rustling of the grass;
The very shadow of the clouds
Have power to shake me as they pass.
I question things and do not find,
One that will answer to my mind;
And all the world appears unkind.

On the other hand, the visitor to Lagos sees in the people—in
the openness of their countenance, the brightness of their eyes,
the freedom of their movement—a fullness of life. We see men,
and women, and children, living in the joys of home; and there
is not a breathing of the common wind that blows which does
not inspire them with the love of that home. The trees and the



clouds, the sluggish rivers, the quiet waters of the lagoon, the
boisterous and perilous bar, are all their own.

And for the exiles who have returned, Lagos has all the elements 
of genuine patriotism. The natural beauty and fertility of
the country, the increasing development of its material resources
—the noble names among their ancestors—the lives of kings and
warriors of their own blood, of whom they have heard—the
great deeds these heroes have performed—the legendry and 
historical songs and ancient dances of the tribes—all become 
inspirations. No suspicion haunts them that the country will ever
be taken from them. They rest, not only in the conviction, but
in the conciousness that it is theirs by divine right, preserved for
them by divine interposition, however for temporary purposes,
and in small localities, it may be ruled by foreigners.

Despite of every yoke she bears,
This land of glory still is theirs.

I have visited the quarter of the Brazilian Repatriates, and I
have been deeply impressed by the results of their labors and
enterprise, under the impulse of the spirit of freedom. They are
drinking in the healing and invigorating influences of their new
surroundings. They are taking advantage of the unquestionable
advantages they enjoy in the land of their fathers.

The use of their own language, which the people of Lagos
have not only retained, but are sedulously cultivating, is another
element of joy, of safety, and of strength. In their religious
gatherings, in their secular meetings, the use of their mother-
tongue must give, for the majority, clearness, precision, and vigor
to their expressions, and carry force to the mind of the hearer,
of which the English language, even in its simplest form, must
always be shorn.

But we must remember that it has not always been so in Lagos.
Less than fifty years ago the place now occupied by this beautiful
settlement was the scene of all the horrors which have ever
marked the track of the piratical monsters who disgraced 
humanity by their atrocious deeds; good government was unknown,
and utterly impossible under the fiendish proceedings of those



enemies of the human race who infested the coast. Agriculture
and honest trade were constantly interrupted by raiding from
within, and rapine from without. Spoliation and bloodshed was
the order of the day.

What a change has been wrought even within tho short life of
a generation! English Christianity and philanthropy, as well as
English statesmanship and commercial enterprise, have brought
about the present promising state of things; and wherever 
England holds sway on this coast, and indeed where she does not
hold sway, the prayer of the natives constantly is, "God save
the Queen."

Africa's relation to the rest of the world has always been strange
and peculiar. Her people have not mingled with the rest of
mankind, except to render service-to give help in times of 
emergency; while there seems to have hung over the country the 
unalterable decree of prohibition against the incursion of foreigners.

The nations of antiquity all tried their hands—Phenicia, Greece,
Carthage, Rome. The Mediterranean nations vied with each
other in endeavors to occupy the country; but they could hold
only the northern margin, and for only brief periods. As we
read the Providential purpose in the events of history, past and
contemporary, we see that God's plan is against the extensive
occupation of this Continent by foreigners. This the statesmen
of antiquity found out after repeated and disastrous failures.
Caesar Augustus, during whose reign Rome was mistress of the
world—whose decree that all the world should be taxed brought
about the fulfillment of a wonderful prophecy which Christendom
has recently been celebrating, and who, like the poets of his day,
believed in the destiny of Rome to sway universal empire—yet
left earnest counsel and direction in his will that the Romans
should never invade Africa. And England, which, in her 
colonizing genius, and in the extent of her empire, is the modern 
antitype of Rome, has until very lately been acting in the spirit of
the advice of Augustus. She has been unwilling to take up lands
in the vast equatorial regions of this country; but recently she
has been forced to depart from her policy by the intermeddling
activity of others, whose enterprises, however, whatever promise



they may now present, must give way to the inexorable destiny
which guards the continent. Lord Salisbury, in his speech in
the Guildhall a few weeks ago (November 9th, 189O), informed
the world that England's departure from her traditional policy
with regard to Africa was an intervention to prevent such an 
intervention as would interfere with the interests of Great Britain,
and therefore with the interests of civilization and humanity.
His lordship vindicated his desire to acquire "large stretches of
African territory and to place them under the British flag," by
reference to the important fact that "every bit of the world's
surface that is not under the British flag is a country which may
be, and probably will be, closed to England by a hostile tariff."
If this had been thought of thirty years ago, Sierra Leone would
not now be hampered on the north in its commercial growth;
and considering how much England has done to open up that
region, the whole of the territory between the Niger and the
Atlantic, with the exception of small strips, would now be under
British rule.

The ancients, who were at the beginning of things, saw many
truths, which, forgotten in the course of time, men are only now
recovering. The Greeks looked upon the interior of Africa as a
place for the abode of the gods, not for ordinary men. They
made their divinities leave the summits of Olympus, and betake
themselves annually to the country of the Ethiopians. It is now
certain that, forty centuries ago, Homer knew of those mountain
kings with their mantle of cloud and snow—Ruwenzori and 
Kilmanjaro. Perhaps it was upon the inaccessible summits of these
African Alps that they planted the seat of the gods.

And what is significant is, that not only could the great men
of antiquity—warriors and kings and statesmen—make no 
impression upon Africa, but even their gods failed to leave any
mark. No writer has told us that these periodical visits left any
trace of their having occurred. To Ethiopia came Jupiter with
his thunderbolts; Juno with her arts and sciences; Apollo with
his brightness and music; Venus with her beauty and love; Mars
with his war—the whole Olympian circle, but they produced no
impression upon the country; at least, even the fertile imagination



of their worshippers could invent none. Africa has always
resisted and thrown off foreign influences, because those 
influences, even of the highest character, have come modified with
elements injurious to the country. Jupiter came with his incest
and adultery; Saturn with his cannibalism; Venus with her 
profligacy; Apollo with his creulty; Mars with his sanguinary disposition.

Europe then, even in the days of her heathenism, though the
very best of her productions, according to her highest conceptions,
were in constant intercourse with Africa, had no influence upon
her. There was nothing in the mythology of Greece or Rome,
in the military prowess of Cambyses or Alexander, in the 
commercial greed and enterprise of Carthage, to make any permanent
impression upon the Continent.

Now let us see whether in the days of her Christianity she has
been able to do any permanent work. Everybody knows the
fate of the Christian Church established in North Africa. This
Church had possession of three thousand towns and villages, and
five hundred and sixty Episcopal sees—the Church that produced
Tertullian, Cyprian, and Augustine. After flourishing for 
centuries, it was driven out by the Saracens who have now held the
place formerly occupied by Christians for more than a thousand
years. France holds the government of portions of North Africa,
but the people are Mohammedans, who enforce the laws of their
religion with the assistance or connivance of their foreign rulers.

In modern times, since the revival of the missionary spirit, the
Christian Missions have striven to penetrate the continent, but
they have had to contend, and they are still contending with
insuperable difficulties. Very little has been effected upon the
aborigines away from European settlements; and indeed it may
be stated that the world has yet to witness the example of a single
community, large or small, of free and independent Negroes in
the interior who have embraced Christianity as brought to them
from Europe. It would seem that neither the climate nor the
circumstances of the people will admit of the introduction o
Christianity into this country by members of a foreign race.
Experience everywhere shows the extreme difficulty and 
impossibility of the enterprise.



As samples of the uniform experience of missionary operations
in Africa, and of the general effect of the climate, even in the
most healthy regions, I will quote first from Professor 
Drummond's book on Tropical Africa, and then from Mr. Stanley's
recent book, "In Darkest Africa." Two missionary regions were
visited by Mr. Drummond. The first he thus describes:

"Our next stoppage was to pay another homage—truly this is a tragic
region—at another white man's grave. A few years ago Bishop Mackenzie
and some other missionaries were sent to Africa by the English 
Universities, with instructions to try to establish a Mission in the footsteps of
Livingstone. They came here; the climate overpowered them; one by
one they sickened and died. With the death of the Bishop himself the
site was abandoned, and the few survivors returned home. Among the
hippopotamus—trampled reeds on the banks of the Shiré, under a rough
iron cross, lies the first of three brave Bishops who have already made their
graves in Equatorial Africa."

The second missionary station on the shore of the upland lake
tells a similar tale:

"A neat path through a small garden led up to the settlement, and I
approached the largest house and entered. It was the Livingstonia
manse—the head missionary's house. It was spotlessly clean; English
furniture was in the room, a medicine chest, familiar—looking dishes were
in the cupboards, books lying about, but there was no missionary in it. I
went to the next house; it was the school; the benches were there and
the black-board, but there were no scholars and no teacher. I passed to
the next; it was the blacksmith's shop; there were the tools and anvil,
but there was no blacksmith. And so on to the next, and the next, all in
perfect order, and all empty. Then a native approached and led me a few
yards into the forest; and there, among the mimosa trees, under a huge
granite mountain, were four or five graves. These were the missionaries.

"I spent a day or two in the solemn shadow of that deserted manse.
It is one of the loveliest spots in the world; and it was hard to believe,
sitting under the tamarind trees by the quiet lake shore, that the pestilence
which wasteth at midnight had made this beautiful spot its home. A 
hundred and fifty miles north, on the same lake-coast, the remnant of the
missionaries have begun their task again, and there, slowly, against 
fearful odds, they are carrying on their work."

Notice again the following:

"Malarial fever is the one sad certainty which every African traveler



must face. For months he may escape, but its finger is upon him, and
well for him if he has a friend near when it finally overtakes him. It is
preceded for weeks, or even for a month or two, by unaccountable 
irritability, depression, and weariness. This goes on day after day till the
crash comes—first cold and pain, then heat and pain, then every kind of
pain, and every degree of heat, then delirium, then the life-and-death
struggle. He rises, if he does rise, a shadow; and slowly accumulates
strength for the next attack, which he knows too well will not disappoint
him. No one has ever yet got to the bottom of African fever. Its
geographical distribution is still unmapped, but generally it prevails over
the whole east and west coasts within the tropical limit, along all the river
courses, on the shores of the inland lakes, and in all low-lying and marshy
districts. The higher plateaux, presumably, are comparatively free from
it, but in order to reach these malarious districts of greater or smaller area
have to be traversed. There the system becomes saturated with fever
which often develops long after the infected region is left behind.

"The really appalling mortality of Europeans is a fact with which all
who have any idea of casting in their lot with Africa should seriously
reckon. None but those who have been on the spot, or have followed
closely the inner history of African exploration and missionary work can
appreciate the gravity of the situation. The malaria spares no man;
the strong falls as the weak; no number of precautions can provide
against it; nu kind of care can do more than make the attacks less
frequent; no prediction can be made beforehand as to which regions are
haunted by it and which are safe. It is not the least ghastly feature of
this invisible plague that the only known scientific test for it at present
is a human life. That test has been applied in the Congo region already
with a recklessness which the sober judgment can only characterize as
criminal. It is a small matter that men should throw away their lives,
in hundreds if need be, for a holy cause; but it is not a small matter that
man after man, in long and in fatal succession, should seek to overleap
what is plainly a barrier of nature. And science has a duty in pointing
out that no devotion or enthusiasm can give any man a charmed life,
and that those who work for the highest ends will best attain them in
humble obedience to the common laws. Transcendentally, this may be
denied; the warning finger may be despised as the hand of the coward
and the profane; but the fact remains-the fact of an awful chain of
English graves stretching across Africa."

Mr. Stanley's experience on the upland plains is not unlike
that of Mr. Drummond. At pp. 31-2, vol. II, of Darkest
Africa, he summarizes his own experience:

"On the plateau of Kavalli and Undussuma Messrs. Jephson, Parke,



and myself were successively prostrated by fever, and the average level
of the land was over 4,500 feet above the sea. On descending to the
Nyanza plain, 2,500 feet lower, we were again laid up with fierce attacks.
At Banana Point, which is at sea level, ague is only too common. At
Boma, 80 feet higher, the ague is more common still. At Vivi there were
more cases than elsewhere, and the station was about 250 feet higher than
Boma, and not a swamp near it. At Stanley Pool, about 1,100 feet above
sea level, fever of a pernicious form was prevalent. While ascending the
Congo with the wind astern we were unusually exempted from ague; but
descending the Upper Congo, facing the wind, we were smitten with most
severe forms of it."

Mr. Stanley concludes his reference to the Central African
climate thus:

"Therefore it is proved that from 0 to 5,000 feet above the sea there is
no immunity from fever and ague; that over forty miles of lake water
between a camp and the other shore are no positive protection; that a
thousand miles of river course may serve as a flue to convey malaria in a
concentrated form; that if there is a thick screen of primeval forest, or a
grove of plantains between the dwelling place and a large clearing or
open country, there is only danger of the local malaria around the 
dwelling, which might be rendered harmless by the slightest attention to the
system; but in the open country neither a house nor a tent is a sufficient
protection, since the air enters by the doors of the house and under the
flaps and through the ventilators to poison the inmates."

With regard to the general effect of missionary work in this
country, we can not shut our eyes to the facts all around us. The
native missionaries on the Niger have been recently censured for
not achieving greater spiritual results under what must be 
regarded as impossible circumstances.

The success of Christianity in apostolic times can not be taken
as a standard by which to judge of its progress in unevangelized
lands at the present day. Primitive Christianity had this 
negative advantage, that it was not theoretically presented and 
practically misrepresented at the same time. The Apostles were not
confronted on mission ground by their own countrymen of the
same creed, doing openly and with indifference the very things
they were commissioned to denounce. Modern commerce in its
agents is a most potent drawback to all the ideas held up by the



missionary. The natives have the example of the white and black
missionary preaching on the one hand against the very things
which the white Christian trader and the black Christian trader
are practicing on the other. And the native can not discriminate
between the mere professor of religion and its possessor.

Wherever it is thought desirable to plant a mission station as
a center of influence, there it is also considered profitable to 
establish the trading factory; and, as "the children of this world are
in their generation wiser than the children of light," the trader
becomes the controlling influence in that region, demanding and
securing the services of the protegés of the Mission, both male
and female, as soon as they have acquired enough training to be
serviceable for domestic and other purposes. The missionary is
helpless to deal with this evil, while, with tears in his eyes, he
sees his work continually neutralized.

The Church Missionary Intelligencer for April, 1887, contained
a most pathetic example of these trials, as given in a report by
Bishop Crowther: "When we come," says the Bishop, "to 
consider the want of suitable agents for the Mission, either from Sierra
Leone or Lagos, now keenly felt, it might appear as if no efforts
had been made at the early part of the Mission to train up 
promising youths from our schools, who might be hereafter employed
as teachers in due time. This was not at all neglected. Since
the commencement of this Mission, I have sent no less than 
fourteen promising youths to Sierra Leone and Lagos grammar
schools and training institutions to be educated, with the 
intention of employing them as teachers in course of time; but out of
this number there are no more than four who remain to be thus
employed. All the rest have resigned connection with the Society,
and are now employed in the service of the national company as
agents in the trading factories, or as stokers or engine drivers in
their steamers, with the exception of one in our employ as a young
carpenter."

When Europe must send out her traders and her missionaries
together, holding the present world in one hand and trying to
point to the next with the other, missionary societies must not
expect to realize those large results which their theory requires.



Apostolic results must have apostolic circumstances. The 
exigencies of trade—and they are increasing daily—are imperious, and
the demands of Christianity are equally so; human nature being
what it is, it needs no prophet to foretell which of the two will
prevail, where commerce is allowed a free hand to regulate its
own operations. The agents of trade feel that their first duty is
to promote their business, which is purely worldly and secular.
They can not be expected to look after the spiritual or 
intellectual interests of their customers. To give support and currency
to Christian ideas, as Europeans understand those ideas, it is
thought by some that the European colony, with its 
administrative and executive machinery, is necessary; but the effect in favor
of the religion of Christ at Sierra Leone, the oldest and the most
important of the English colonies, is not considered encouraging
even by missionary societies, who deprecate the influence of that
colony upon their missions away from the coast.* Sierra Leone
is not only a sea-port, but a garrison town, with its drinking 
saloons and other disreputable houses, the inevitable concomitants,
it would appear, of civilization, but entirely unknown in the regions
beyond. Christianity can not be said to be in the ascendancy at
the other colonies of Gambia, Cape Coast, or Lagos.

In the efforts to spread Christianity in Africa, missionaries
generally lose sight of the fact—if, indeed, they are aware of it
—that no large number of Africans, in freedom, have as yet 
accepted Christianity. No African tribe, no African chief of 
influence, has ever become Christian. In the early days of 
missionary operations in the Congo, some four centuries ago, the
natives were baptized as Charlemange baptized the Saxons—"by
platoons;" but no such wholesale conversions have since taken
place in Africa, and the region where these exceptional scenes
were witnessed, has long since relapsed into heathenism. The
American and West Indian Negroes, and the Negroes in 
European Colonies in West and East Africa accepted Christianity
either by force of circumstances, or through gratitude for deliverance

* One of the charges against a native missionary in the Niger is that he
introduced into his school a Sierra Leone boy.



from their enslavers. But very few free and independent
men in Africa submit to the religion brought to them from Europe.
Canon Taylor says it is too high for them. Perhaps this is true.
It has been lifted above Christ by the complications of Europe,
from Gospel freeness and universality to theological dogmas and
metaphysics; and, as I have just suggested, the progress of 
European commerce is making matters worse. The problem of
introducing Christianity into Africa without the aid of 
independent colonies of Negroes from the Western Hemisphere, with the
experience and discipline of the house of bondage, is impossible
of solution.

Well, now the question might occur, Is there to be no foreign
missionary work in Africa? If not, what is the meaning of the
command, "Go ye into all the world," etc.

The meaning of God's word is often to be arrived at by the
light of His Providence. He has declared that "in Christ all the
nations shall be blessed,"—that "He will give to him the heathen
for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his
possession." This promise it is His purpose to carry out; but, so
far at least as Africa is concerned, not by the methods now 
cherished by the great missionary bodies in Europe and America.
We can not but entertain feelings of the deepest graditude to the
missionary societies and to the missionaries who have so nobly
expended, and are still expending, their lives and treasure in a
work in which they are following their very highest convictions
of duty. But I think if they would study the two books which
lie open before them—the book of revelation and the book of
providence—they might be led to consider whether there are not
other and more efficient agents who should be introduced to carry
on the work. They have attempted to do, and have succeeded
in doing, in many respects, a magnificent work for God and 
humanity. They have poured out money like water, and "have
not counted their lives dear unto themselves." I hope that the
African will never say a word or think a thought incompatible
with the deepest gratitude and admiration for all the sacrifices
and expenditures, all the sufferings and trials endured, all the
good work accomplished by the band of self-denying men of all



Christian denominations who have come and are still coming
from Europe and America to evangelize Africa. But I repeat,
that all the experience of the past, and all the experience of the
present, assures us that no widespread or permanent work can
be done by these means.

Nor is it any better with the secular agencies which are 
attempting to deal with the African problem. About two years ago we
heard of the extensive commercial enterprise in East Africa, 
carried on by Germans; but the difficulties in the way of success
seemed to be too great to be overcome by the money or men at
command. We now hear nothing of that great effort.

We have just witnessed the downfall of the "Province of
Equatoria," over which for thirteen years Emin Pasha presided,
which cost so much money, and of which such large expectations
were entertained—pulled down by European hands. "Though
I pitied Emin deeply," says Mr. Jephson, "for the disappointment 
he experienced at seeing his work of thirteen years 
tumbling in ruins, I could never regret the downfall of the last of the
Soudan provinces, with its corrupt Egyptian rule."*

The King of the Belgians, with a heroic philanthropy, has
gone on year after year spending an enormous fortune in the 
endeavor to establish the Congo Free State. Recent intelligence
informs us that that State is now on the eve of bankruptcy, its
expenditure exceeding its income, after allowing for the subsidies
of the King, by £25,000 a year.

The operations of the Niger Company do not offer the most
brilliant promise.

The traders, scattered in factories along the coast, lead a gloomy
and most forbidding existence while turning over their goods at
enormous profits in a trade between the sea-coast and the 
interior; but as to any impression, good, bad, or indifferent, made
upon the country beyond its margin, the descriptive word must
be nil.

Mr. Edward Dicey, in a recent number of the Nineteenth Century

* "Emin Pasha and the Rebellion at the Equator," etc. By A. J. Mounteney-Jephson.
London, 1890.



(Sept., 1890), after a serious and eloquent survey of the
difficulties attending the efforts of the Europeans in Central
Africa, recommends to the English nation "a policy of masterly
inactivity." This would indeed be a very simple, not to say 
cowardly, method of confronting the grave responsibilities which
rest upon Europe with regard to Africa.

The slave trade was begun by England in 1562, when Sir John
Hawkins, one of the most renowned naval captains of his time,
seized three hundred slaves near Sierra Leone, and sold them to
the Spaniards in Hayti.

In 1713 was concluded the famous Assiento Contract, by which
the trade was placed in the hands of a company of English
merchants for thirty years. From this time the share taken by
Great Britain in the slave trade became greater than that of any
other nation. The annual importation under the British flag
amounted to 60,000 souls, and included two-thirds of the whole
annual importation from Africa. The men who carried on this
trade were sometimes good men, like the excellent John Newton,
the author of the Olney Hymns, who was for several years commander 
of a slave ship, and who made more than one Guinea
voyage after his conversion.

Sometimes, perhaps generally, the slave traders were demons
in human form. They belonged to all the European nations.
Their trade was carried on under Providential control. An inscrutable
Providence allowed the Africans to be carried away for
a two-fold purpose—to assist in building up a home for the 
overflow of Europe; and for their own training and discipline. For
two hundred years He allowed the traffic, with all its horrors, to
go on, unchecked by any public protest, until near the close of
the eighteenth century a man was raised up to be the prophet of
the Lord, to denounce the nefarious trade, and lead to its 
abolition on the part of England and subsequently of other nations.
It was on the 18th of April, 1791, that Mr. Wilberforce moved
in the House of Commons for leave to bring in a bill to prevent
the further importation of slaves into the West Indies. After
years of conflict, the bill was passed, and the trade received from
the British Government the coup de grace which led up to the
abolition of slavery throughout the British dominions.



God—knowing how He has made the climate, how impossible
it is for foreigners to live here and introduce their improvements,
and how strong the antagonism of race—provided for the 
deportation of large numbers of Africans to a distant land, where, as in
a severe school, they might be fitted for the work of building up
and protecting their ancestral home. That educational training,
intense in its almost fabulous bitterness, has lasted now for three
hundred years.

Now the time has come for the return of the exiles, and they
are the only agency which, whether for religious or secular work,
can effect any widespread changes for good. Providence demands
restoration. Masterly inactivity is impossible. "Rachel weeps
for her children, and refuses to be comforted because they are
not." Her cry is, "Give me back my children!" The world at
large seems as yet deaf to the wailings of the bereaved at home, and
to the cries for relief of the exiles beyond the sea. They have
poured out thousands for the rescue from Africa of two individuals
only who did not wish to be rescued—men who loved the people
and the scenes amid which they lived and were devoted to the
work in which they were engaged. The twenty thousand pounds
spent for the rescue of Emin Pasha could have planted on this
coast or in the interior a flourishing settlement of industrious
Negro agriculturists from the United States or the West Indies
who in a few years would have redeemed a large district for 
civilization and made important additions to the valuable articles of
commerce. Surely "blood is thicker than water;" and "to him
that hath shall be given," even when he says, "I do not want."
But the final ground of judgment will be, "Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto the least," etc.

In the mysterious work to be done in this mysterious land we
have two types of the agencies thus far employed, both English—
Sir John Hawkins, who represents the inauguration of the trade,
or the despoiler, and Mr. William Wilberforce, who represents
the extinguisher of the evil. Who shall represent the Restorer?
I may be allowed to say that the name of Moloney will in years
to come be cited as that character. He is the only representative
of Great Britain, in official position, who has announced it as a



public policy to repatriate the exiles. He is the only British officer
who has as yet practically recognized the gravity of the African
situation, and the grandeur and glory of the work of restoring to
their country the long-lost exiles. In the annals of the future,
Hawkins, Wilberforce, Moloney, will stand for the three great
facts or agencies in the work of African development. I must
confess that I feel something of indignation as well as regret to be
obliged to couple the two last names with the first. But in history
such incongruous associations sometimes occur. We have Jesus
of Nazareth and Judas Iscariot. Their names are often mentioned
together in the gospel history.

With regard to Lagos itself, there have been other governors
who have done much and noble work for the improvement of the
settlement. The name of John Hawley Glover will never be
forgotten for his self-denying and important labors; and it is interesting
to see that a magnificent structure, now in course of
construction, will soon adorn and beautify your city as a fitting
memorial of his work and achievements. So, in the history of
West African governments, the names of Sir Charles McCarthy,
Sir Arthur Kennedy, and Sir John Pope Hennessy will forever
stand prominent. They, however, had predecessors in their line;
but the place of the pioneer in any great movement must always
be unique. Columbus discovered America. He will always occupy 
that unapproachable eminence, however others may have utilized
his discovery in a way far beyond his most enchanting dreams.
Bishop Crowther must always stand first in the history of any
native church whatever form it may take. That name must forever
be honorably identified with the history of West African
Christianity. So, in the history of repatriation under British
auspices, the name of Sir Alfred Moloney must lead the train of
successors in that line that must come after him; some, perhaps,
to do in larger measure the work he has inaugurated.

The time is now ripe for the return. The American Colonization 
Society has been for more than two generations pointing out the
repatriation of the exiles as the only Providential plan for Africa's
regeneration, and sending home from time to time repatriates in
small numbers. But the world generally, especially England,



has not been ready for this work. Philanthropic and commercial
associations still think that their methods for the regeneration of
Africa are the most promising. But after a few more decades of
exhaustive expenditure, the whole civilized world, secular and
religious, will turn to the only Heaven-ordained agency for the
great work—viz., the Africans in exile.

I must not omit to mention here, and to put on record, the 
expression of my admiration and gratitude for the important part
which the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the
African Steamship Company have taken in forwarding the work of
repatriation; indeed, those companies and their enterprising agents
have done more within the last forty years than any other single
agency to promote and develop African civilization in all its most
healthful phases; and to them Africans owe a great and 
inextinguishable debt.

The S. S. "Biafra" left here a few days ago on her second
voyage in the work of the restoration.

It will send a thrill of deepest joy throughout the ranks of thou-
sands of anxious and expecting Negroes in North America when
they learn that steam communication has been established between
West Africa and South America for the especial purpose of aiding
the return of the exiles.

And not only is there a preparation going on for this work in
the hearts and minds of the exiles, but men of influence in England
and America are being stirred up to take interest in the question.
A copy of a letter was sent to me a few days ago, written by an
English clergyman, Rev. Francis P. Flemynge, LL. D., F. R.
G. S., on the subject, to G. W. Neville, Esq., who has taken so
active a part in bringing steam to the aid of would-be repatriates
in Brazil. The letter is dated September 25, and is as follows:

"That over one million of negroes should be anxious to return to their
native land, and be prevented by poverty alone, has so stirred my 
compassion that I have resolved to try at once and form an 'African Repatriation
Relief Society' for the purpose of collecting funds to give free and assisted
passages to these poor creatures from Brazils and Havana to Africa.

"I have already written to several friends who I hope will assist me, and
I have laid the matter before Lord Salisbury and other authorities.

"I propose to form a society totally irrespective of all religions or political



differences of opinion, and purely based on philanthropic principles,
to try and carry out this laudable object. I hope I do not overrate the
generosity of Britain, but I can not but believe that there are thosands who
will be glad to help us.

"I propose returning to England next spring. Between this and then I
shall hope to have all afloat, and then I would undertake a crusade, 
holding meetings in all the large towns and manufacturing centers."

It is hardly necessary for me to stop here to recount the 
advantages which would flow from the return of experienced 
agriculturists and skilled mechanics; the influence they would exert
upon the tribes in reconciling their differences, settling their wars
as disinterested mediators and arbitrators, and the lessons they
would impart in the various elements and appliances of civilized
life. Imagine the result of one hundred thousand Negroes from
America settled in the Yoruba country, with their knowledge of,
and practice in the use not only of the implements of peace, but
of the instruments of war. What would become of the King of
Dahomey, with his sanguinary customs and his murderous
periodical raids? And what should we not witness in that 
glorious country as the result of a few years of uninterrupted peace!
This is a work you must at once see that no other agency can
accomplish. Our brethren then will return. What is the part
of those of us who are at home? We are to prepare to welcome
them (as I am glad to see you are already welcoming them), and
make them feel the abounding and overflowing joy of the return.
