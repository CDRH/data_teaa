Commercial Agency of the United States,
at Loanda, Washington Febr. 10, 1893

Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

On my way hence I visited the U.S. 
Commercial Agency at Gaboon and ascertained 
the state of its property.

It consists of:
1 book case
1 desk
1 lounge
1 revolving office chair
The customary collections of Consular Reports,
Statutes etc.
A trunk containing old letters
The usual Records and forums

The furniture has been preserved
in fair condition.

The Records do not contain 
anything of importance.

If the Department decides to sell



the furniture, the American Mission at
Gaboon, which has hitherto taken care
of it, is disposed to buy it at a moderate
price.

I have the honor to be, Sir,
your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Coml Agent
