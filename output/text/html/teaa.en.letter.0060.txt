United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda January 1st 1865

I have the honor to
enclose you the Consular Bond
required of me by the Department
which was returned from Boston
for my signature, I had
omitted to affix before forwarding
it to my friends. This circumstance
will explain why
the Bond has not reached
the Department as soon as advised
in my Despatch No 1.


I have the honor
to be
Your most Obd't Serv't
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
