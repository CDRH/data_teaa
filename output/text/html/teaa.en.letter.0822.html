No. 22 19

United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda.
December 30th, 1887

Honorable George L. Rives.
Assistant Secretary of State.
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
the Department that instruction, relative
to "public mourning" contained in Circular
of Oct. 24th, will be obeyed.

The death of the least useful
of our citizens causes hearts to grieve, but
when such men as the late Honorable E.
B. Washburn "pass on," nations mourn.

I have the honor to be,
Sir:
Your obedient servant,
Henry F Downing,
U.S. Consul
