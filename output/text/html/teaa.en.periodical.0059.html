American Missions. 

The African mission of the Protestant Episcopal Church is nearly 
half a century old, and has a total of 425 communicants. Eighty-six 
missionaries from the United States have labored in it, of whom 
twenty-eight died in the field, and it has had, including the present 
incumbent, four Bishops. The new Bishop is a product of the mission. 
The mission is divided into three districtsâ€”Cape Palmas, which 
gives name to the diocese; Sinou and Bassa, and Monrovia and Cape 
Mount. Of the 425 communicants 247 are classed as Liberians, 177 
as native and 1 as American. Three stations in the Cape Palmas district, 
two of which are purely native, contain 221 communicants, of 
whom more than half are Greboes. The Lutheran mission, on the 
St. Paul's river, Rev. David A. Day, superintendent, is making gratifying 
progress. Rev. D. Davidson, native, was ordained and has become 
pastor of the first self-sustaining church at Muhlenburg. This 
is an industrial mission, coffee planting having become helpful toward 
support. Missionaries of the Baptist Foreign Mission Convention, 
(colored,) have established a station at Cape Mount, Liberia, among 
the Veys. They find the youth quick and intelligent, and report surprising 
progress in conversions. 

Although the restrictions imposed by the French Government at 
the Gaboon and on the Ogove have filled the path of the missionaries 
of the Presbyterian Board with hindrances, there have been 
scenes of hopeful labor, and visible fruits have arisen. The French 
authorities at the Gaboon, bent on Gallicanizing their colony, have 
insisted on having all schools conducted in the French language. This 
requisition, if it cannot be changed, may put an end to the schools. It 
is hoped that France will at least permit the preaching of the Gospel 
to the natives of French Africa in the vernacular and the maintenance 
of the vernacular schools.



The American Board mission at Bihe is suffering suspension for 
a time through the influence of Portuguese traders. It is believed 
that the interruption is but temporary. The result of the fifty years' 
labor of the Board among the Zulus is thus given: The fifteen 
native churches report a membership of 782, with a gain 
this year of 118, or 16 per cent., and their annual contributions 
to all purposes amount to $3,694. The native agency consists of 52 
preachers, two of them pastors; 42 teachers and 43 other help, who,
with the missionary force at 59 different preaching places, are presenting 
the Gospel to a population of 75,000. The work of higher 
education is carried on in a theological school with 15 pupils, a boys' 
boarding school with 46 pupils, and two girls' boarding schools with 
88 pupils, while 41 common schools give instruction to 1,700 pupils. 
The mission located on Inhambane Bay, though one of the youngest 
missions of the Board, shows itself not least in enterprise or industry. 
Three extended journeys of exploration, besides several shorter excursions, 
are reported this year, and valuable results have been secured. 
Large populations in fertile territory, accessible to missionary 
labor, have been found between the Limpopo river and the coast. The 
three families of the mission have their several places of residence 
amid friendly people not far from each other, and from these three 
centres they are now ready to acquire the language and begin systematically 
the evangelical work which they hope in time to carry from 
the sea to the heart of the Continent. 

Bishop William Taylor, who is at the head of a missionary colony 
of over fifty persons, preachers, physicians, mechanics and farmers, 
with their wives and thirteen children, presided at the Liberia 
Annual Conference at Monrovia in January. The Bishop writes from 
Nhangepepe, June 19: "I and a half dozen of our men are out here, 
about 300 miles from Loanda, preparing the way for the settlement of 
our families. We have surveyed a mission farm of over 2,000 acres 
of splendid land, in which we can grow anything tropical or temperate. 
The people receive us gladly. This is a place that we must occupy; 
fine country, 2,300 feet elevation and, large population. This 
is our first inland station."

Colonization.

The Congo is the country to which some Americans would direct 
the people of color to emigrate from the United States. We 
have always felt about the efforts of Europeans to settle the Congo 
State that their undertaking would not prove an exception to the 
rule, viz:, that Europeans cannot colonize Equatorial Africa. The 
policy of the American Colonization Society will always remain the 
true and only policy for the civilization and regeneration of the 
"Dark Continent." Every day's experience is proving this. Liberia 
is not only the most fertile, salubrious and beautiful section of West 
Africa, but it has convenient access to the wealthiest districts of the 
Niger valley. It is not difficult for a man of the least energy to make 
a comfortable living. 

Africa, south of Liberia, may be considered inaccessible to Americans. 
It does not seem possible for them to get a foothold in the 
Cameroons, where the Germans control the trade, or in Fernando 
Po, subject to Spanish rule, or in the Niger country, Dahomey, the 
Gold Coast and Ashantee, all under English influence. Liberia furnishes 
the most promising field for American enterprise, both commercial and agricultural.


A recent writer on "Some of the difficulties in the way of extending 
trade in Africa," complains of the absence of labor for mechanical, 
agricultural or trading purposes. Now the Colonization Society 
furnishes Africa with labor for all these departments. There is no 
other part of the Continent where so many mechanics and practical 
farmers are to be found as in that Republic. Multiply the characteristics 
of Liberia and the civilization of Africa is secured. Bishop 
Gilbert Haven said: "Let Liberia fill up her land with farmers, and 
she will conquer Africa." Only the United States possesses the 
agents for making these farms, and only the Colonization Society is 
able to assist any of these agents to remove to Africa. The Colonization 
Society ought to be much encouraged, for God is showing to 
the world that its methods and plans for Africa's civilization and 
Christianization are the most practicable and effectual methods.



The movement among the descendants of Africa in this country 
for emigration to the fatherland is causing great interest all along the 
coast in and out of Liberia, and an earnest desire prevails to welcome
the returning exiles. There are vast and fruitful districts in the Republic 
awaiting to afford them comfortable and prosperous homes.

To the regeneration of Africa we are definitely pledged by our 
work in Liberia, by our share in the founding of the Congo Free 
State and by our leading place among the nations of the earth. A 
more glorious inheritance and a more arduous and inspiring enterprise 
it is impossible to conceive, and history is not likely again to furnish.
