Sir,

I have the honor to report to 
the Department that Domestic Slavery
ceased to be recognized by the Portuguese
Government, throughout all
their possessions on the West Coast of
Africa, on the 17th July, according
to the Royal Decree of the 29th April.

As I expected no demonstration 
of any kind whatever took place
in Loanda; either on the part of the
Government, the European residents,
or the liberated slaves themselves,
not



not a flag was displayed, nor a gun
fired, to mark the importance of a day
which gave liberty to thousands.
This can be explained only by the 
slaves themselves doubting the reality
of their new state, and the want of
interest taken in the movement by
both Government and residents.
Outwardly the day passed off in the 
usual way, nor has there since been
any apparent difference in the city.
The slaves who liked their masters
have, with few exceptions, remained,
receiving the price of their services, 
which has been determined by Government.
An office has been established 
in Loanda, where all contracts
made between the planters and the 
freedmen



freedmen are registered, according
to the rate of wages fixed by law,
and where they can complain, in 
case that their contracts are not
fully carried out. In contracting
with the freedmen; their late owners
have, according to law, the preference
to their services for a term of two years
they paying them, according to the 
established rate, viz;



Men and women
Per month 3$000  = $3.36


Youths 15 to 21 years
"    "    2$500 = $2.77


dos. 11 to 15
"    "    1$950 = $2.12



If preferred, the contract can be
made for food and clothing, and
a smaller amount per month.
By this plan the planters are enabled
to retain the services of their
best



best hands, and are thus saved from
considerable loss and inconvenience.
Large numbers of the liberated slaves
from the plantations in the neighbourhood,
at first left their employment,
and came to the city,
but when they found that liberty
did not mean idleness, and that
they were obliged to work for the
Government until they arranged
other employment, they have nearly
all returned.

From the interior I have
no definite news of the results of the
emancipation, but I expect that
it will make little change there.
I hear complaints of the great
scarcity of labour in proportion
to



to the increase of the plantations;
but there has been no outbreak nor
is there any anticipated. It will
no doubt take some time before
both planters and natives get accustomed
to the new state of things.
Previously a planter could always
purchase laborers, now he has
to go into the open hiring market,
where he meets with considerable
competition in consequence of a
number of small planters having
recently sprung up, who can now
procure labour, without a large
outlay of Capital in the purchase
of Slaves.

I have the honor to be,
Your most obedient servant,
Robt S Newton
Vice Commercial Agent
