America's Attitude on Congo Question Pleases British Foreign Office.





London, Feb. 24. -- Lord Fitzmaurice, representing the foreign office, addressed the
House of Lords to-day on the Congo situation. He regretted, he said, that his information
from Brussels showed that the attitude of the Congo State toward the demand that it
carry out its treaty obligations was most unsatisfactory. He pleaded, however, that
the Belgian Government should have a little more time allowed it in which to accomplish
the reforms in the Congo region for which the civilized world was calling.

Lord Fitzmaurice expressed great gratification with the attitude of the United States
touching the Congo questions. "I regard the co-operation of the United States of the
highest importance," he said, "not merely because of the influence and power of the
United States, great as these are, but because the United States could not under any
conceivable circumstances be charged with what Great Britain unfortunately has been
charged abroad, namely, purely selfish ambition."
