Hon William M. Evarts
Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir,

As the period, for which I have 
remained leave of absence, from the 
U.S. Commercial Agency at Gaboon 
Equatorial West Africa, will soon
expire; I hasten to inform the Department, 
that I have been seriously
ill during the last few weeks
I am now convalescent, and expect 
to go to New York, in a day or two, 
for medical advice. If the report
is favorable Mrs Bushnell and myself 
purpose sailing October eleventh 
for Liverpool, ene route for 
Gaboon. I will inform you of 
our final decision at the earliest 
day practicable.

I have recently received a despatch 
from Rev S. H. Murphy, who was left 
in charge of the Commercial Agency 
informing me that soon after 
my departure, he had been denyed



the privilege of flying the flag,
because the Government at Paris,
had not been officially informed 
of the re establishment of 
the Commercial Agency, after 
its temporary discontinuance.
If I return as Commercial 
Agent, or as Consul; it will
be necessary for the Government 
at Paris, to be officially informed 
of the fact, and an Exequater 
be solicited.

Permit me to add, new forms 
will be needed, and also flags.
As soon as the question of my 
returning in October is decided, 
I shall have the honor of 
making definite requests to 
the Department. 

I have the honor to be, 
Sir:
Most Respectfully,
Your Obedient Servant, 
Albert Bushnell
U.S. Com'l Agent.
