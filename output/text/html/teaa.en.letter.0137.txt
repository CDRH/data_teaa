Sir,

I have the honor to 
report to the Department that
Small-pox has broken out among
the natives at this port, and 
there are great fears that it 
will extend to the interior. If
it does it will cause great loss
both to Merchants and Agriculturists
as the natives have a 
great horror of this disease and
will keep away. It was brought
to Ambriz by the small steamer
"La Plata" and has now broken
out here and more or less at
all the ports of the Province.
The Doctors are doing all in 
their power to keep the disease
from spreading, and try all
they can to get all the cases
into the Hospital, which is
exceedingly difficult as the
natives



natives hide their sick friends
in their houses, as they have a
great aversion to go to the
Hospital. All the natives about
the town and outskirts are being
vaccinated, and with good
results. It is very rare indeed
when white people suffer from
this disease in these climates.
Any vessel leaving this port
at present will not get a 
clean Bill of Health.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul

To the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
