Sir,

I have to report the arrival here of three
American sailors on the 13th inst, in the Mail Str
"Angola". The Captain of the "Angola" states that 
he was requested to bring them from Benguella to 
this port, where they would find a Consular officer
to understand and look after them.

The men themselves state that they deserted 
from the American Whaling Barque "Matta
Poisette", Captain Stegburgh, of New Bedford, 
at the Port of Equimina and walked about




When out whaling, they also complain 
that the mate refused them water, and
made them pull for hours without a drink,
there being plenty of water in the boat.

The men have nothing but what
they stand in, so I have taken charge
of them, and send them to the Cape
de Verde Islands by the present steamer,
Paying Â£5. (five pounds) passage money
for each

Their names are Andrew Schmitt,
Louis Umlandt, and Niels Hansen.

I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant
Robt S Newton
U.S. Vice-Consul

To the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
