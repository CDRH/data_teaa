Department of State Received Jul 8 1890

95 St. Georges Square
London 26th June 1890.

Sir,

I have the honor to inform the
Department that my leave of absence
expires on the 30th inst, and as my
health will not permit me to 
return to the Coast for some time,
I feel it my duty to tender my
resignation as Vice Consul.
From my experience of the two last
Consuls sent to Loanda, I take
the Liberty to suggest to the
Department that it would be
advisable to have a resident
Vice Consul of experience at
Loanda, whether another Consul
may be appointed or not, and
would recommend the nomination
of Mr. Edward Bannister who is
at present acting for me.

To the Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, 
U.S.



He has been connected with my
firm of Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co.
for several years, and I can
thoroughly recommend him as a
good business man, and every way
fitted to represent your Government
at Loanda.

Mr. Bannister also represents the
British Government and has shown
great tact in the late difficulties
between the British and Portugal
Governments.

I am, Sir,
Your obedient Servant.
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul for
St. Paul de Loanda
