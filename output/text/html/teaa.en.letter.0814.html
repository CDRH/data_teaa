Hon James D. Porter.
Assistant Secretary of State.
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform the
Department that I am seriously ill
and as the limited amount of my
compensation does not permit the
employment of clerical assistance,
I am compelled to ask from the
Department, for the present and until
convalescene, freedom from a too
critical perusal of my correspondence.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Henry F. Downing
