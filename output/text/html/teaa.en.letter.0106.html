No. 119.

United States Commercial Agency
St. Paul de Loanda 12th Decr 1876

To the Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir,

I have the honor to request
the Department the favor to send
to the Commercial Agency two
National flags, of a large size say
15 ft. by 10 ft.

As it is customary here to 
hoist all consulate flags on Sundays
and all public holidays; those now
in use at this Agency are considerably
worn. A large flag is necessary
on account of the height of the flag
staff at my residence
Messrs



Messrs Yates and Porterfield of 
New York have often vessels to 
Gaboon which would be a good way
to send them as there are two
steamers a month from that port 
to this

I have the honor to be,
Your most obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Commercial Agent
