Sir

I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of my Consular Bond
returned to me by the Department
for insertion of name as principal
and to have affixed thereto an
Internal Revenue stamp of one
Dollar.

I expected my friends in
Boston would have completed the
omission now pointed out to me
when said bond was in their
hands to sign as bondmen.

This Despatch with the bond enclosed completed
will be


Hon William H Seward
Secretary of State
Washington

from Charlestown Mass. by my
wife Mrs Isabel D. A. Silva.


I have the honor
to be
Your most Obedt Servt
Augustus Archer Silva
