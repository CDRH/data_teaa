No. 5

Consulate of the United States
Loanda, December 5, 1888

Honorable G. L. Rives,
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
the Department, that having 
been here over 20 years, it has 
been my custom of late to leave
to leave Loanda for two or three
months about February or March
for a change of air, this being
the commencement of what is
considered the most unhealthy
season; and although I have
only just resumed my duties
as U.S. Vice Consul I have
the



honor to request the Department
to grant me three months' leave
of absence dating from or about
the months above mentioned.

I have also to request the 
Department to allow me to nominate
my clerk, Mr Edward Bannister
to take charge of the archives and
assume the duties during my absence
He is well up in the duties of the
Consulate and acted for me in 1887.
His Bond will no doubt still 
exist in the Department

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul
