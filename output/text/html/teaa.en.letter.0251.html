Sir

I have the honor to state that
Despatch No 12 is received and contents
carefully noted, for which I thank the 
Department.

I have been following a real slave
business going on here and carried
out by Portuguese from Lisbon and 
both whites and mulattos of this 
country. I wanted and still
intend to follow them on that business
up to the near interior where the 
purchase is effected by Barter, &amp;c &amp;c
as is the case, I am told, throughout
almost all the trading posts, not
only of the interior but near the seaboard 
and rivers: Such is the case
at the most important town of
Dande on the Quanza river: Ambriz
and



and specially at the southern
ports of Benguella and Catumbella
where large caravans of two and
three thousand negroes are constantly
arriving from the interior, bringing
along with their produce numbers
of young blacks for sale or barter; 
they average in ages from infancy 
to full grown adults, and always
find a ready market with brisk
competition.

From the small seaport of Novo-Redondo
South of Loanda, an export
trade has been regularly carried
on for more than five years by
the agents and on account of the 
Bank Alltramarine of Lisbon. The
agent from this port is a Mr
Patricio Alvares, and although certain 
forms are carried out as prescribed 
by their emigration laws,
it is well known that as soon
as they are landed at St Thomas,
and that by the hundreds. they
are treated, conducted and consi-
dered



dered as slaves; and not one
has ever been known to have returned, 
and most probably never
will be.

But I have been now for a 
long time very sick, and this
month hardly able to write, even
my wife Mrs Du Verge has left
for the United States via Liverpool:
she has with her a live specimen
of slave traffic in Africa; a stolen
child given to her by a respectable
white merchant for the simple reason 
that she was too young to be
sold.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
L. de R. du Verge
United States Consul
