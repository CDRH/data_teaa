Zanzibar,
July 8th 1892.

Sir,

I have the honour to inform you
that, acting under instructions received
from Her Majesty's Government, I have
caused to be closed several shops,
belonging to Goanese subjects of
Portugal, in which an unlicensed
sale of liquor was being carried on
in defiance of the regulations issued
by the Protecting Power with a view
to fulfilling its obligations incurred
under Article XCI of the Brussels Act.
The owners of these shops had been
several times warned of the consequences 
of offering defiance to
the Brussels Act and had been
advised

Jones, Esq.
Consul for the United States
of America
Zanzibar.
