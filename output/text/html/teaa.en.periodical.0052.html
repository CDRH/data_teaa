Late from Liberia.

Return of the Stevens—Letters—Extracts from
Liberian papers.

Return of the Ship Mary Caroline Stevens.





This fine ship, returning form her ninth voyage to Liberia, after a
passage of thirty days, arrived at Baltimore on the 4th of last month.

She left in the port of Monrovia the brig Palmas, of Baltimore,
soon to sail for the leeward; a schooner from Boston, for sale, about
to leave for Sierra Leone; and the Liberia schooners Moses Sheppard,
James Hall, and the Liberia—all soon to leave for the leeward trade.
Several smaller Liberia vessels were also inside the bar in the Mesurado River. The
American brig Ocean Eagle, Capt. Yates, sailed
for New York on the 27th of February, with several missionary passengers 
to the Gaboon River.

Among the articles brought home in the ship we notice 145 casks
of palm oil, over 100 tons of camwood, 53 blocks of cedar, 6 packages
of ground-nuts, sundry bags and boxes of coffee and ginger, 24 bbls.
of molasses, and one or two bbls. of sugar. In the cabin came as
passengers, Dr. James Hall, his daughter and her friend Miss Sumner,
Mrs. Seys, wife of the Rev. John Seys; the Rev. Mr. Rambo and
lady, Rev. Mr. Crummell and family, of the Episcopal Mission; Rev.
Mr. White, of the Methodist Mission; Rev. Mr. Officer, of the
Mission of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Dr. Roberts, of Monrovia, 
and the Rev. M. M. Clark, of the Methodist Mission. There
were also one or two steerage passengers.



The main features of news in Liberia were the operations of the
Liberia troops under President Benson, in settling a long difficulty
between two native tribes in the County of Maryland. It seems that
a powerful and warlike tribe, emerging from the interior, drove a
coast tribe from their towns and took forcible possession. The Liberian 
Government have vainly endeavored to settle the matter amicably, 
and to persuade the invaders to surrender their ill-gotten spoils
and territory and retire. The only reply has been, "Might makes
right," setting the Liberian authorities at defiance. President Benson
found it necessary to take one hundred and fifty men and go down
and bring them to terms. Some pretty serious fighting was the
result, and an ultimate yielding on the part of the native chiefs, payment
of expenses of the war, and retiring again to the bush. The
Liberians lost three men only, two privates and Major Pickett, of
Maryland County, who fell while storming a barricaded town.

It was thought Mr. Benson would be re-elected to the Presidency,
though he is warmly opposed by Mr. Yates, formerly Vice President.

The "Congo question," as the Liberians term the introduction of
recaptured Africans, has caused no little excitement. All, however,
is quiet now on that score. Those landed at Sinou have proved
somewhat refractory, but President Benson will no doubt settle all
difficulties.

The Republic is reported to be in a prosperous condition. The
sugar-making is on the increase, as also the culture of coffee, cotton,
and other tropical productions. The multiplication of interior settlements 
is now under consideration, and a measure so important will
not, we trust, be left long unaccomplished.

No letters from the Liberian authorities arrived by this ship, owing,
it is presumed, to the absence of President Benson, who was engaged
successfully in repelling the hostilities of a native tribe near Sinou.

In our last number we mentioned the negotiation of a treaty with
the Government of Liberia, by our able Commissioner, Dr. James
Hall, under instructions from the Board of Directors, by which the
management of recaptured Africans, after their arrival in that Republic, 
is confided to that Government; which, we are happy to believe, 
will adopt a wise and humane policy for their civilization and
welfare, in preparation for their admission to all the duties and immunities 
of citizenship. We are very happy to publish the following
extracts from a letter from the Rev. John Seys, U.S. Agent; observations 
made by that excellent Missionary of the Episcopal Church
the Rev. C. C. Hoffman, who returned in the Stevens to Cape
Palmas, and other communications.

U.S. Agency for Liberated Africans,
Monrovia, February 20, 1861

Rev. W. McLain,
Financial Secretary A. C. S,

Dear Sir—

* * * * * * *

I now have the pleasure to inform you that the negotiation between
your special commissioner and the Liberian Government ended in
the ratification of the proposed contract, by which the latter becomes
the disburser of all expenditures for the support of liberated Africans.
You will doubtless received a copy of the said contract, and perceive
that, in perfect keeping with the duties assigned by the U.S. Government
to their Agent here for liberated Africans, no portion of the
said appropriation can be realized without certificates from the said 
Agent that the conditions named in the contract with the American
Colonization Society, and by them transferred to this Government,
have been fully and faithfully met.

It would have been very desirable if an Agent representing the
American Colonization Society here could have been appointed,
between whom and the U.S. Agent for liberated Africans, a better
and more perfect understanding of the nature of both contracts could
have been had. For good and weighty reasons, however, under the
existing circumstances, no such Agent was appointed by your special 
Commissioner, and yet all the arrangements for the transfer of the
Africans, and all their provisions and stores yet on hand, were most
amicably made and completed between the proper authorities of this 
Government and the U.S. Agent for Liberated Africans.

It was deemed better, after mature reflection and consultation, that
I should continue to disburse to the end of the year 1860. This has
been done, and a transfer made to the Liberian Government, on the
faith of your contract with them, by which they meet all expenses
accruing from January 1, 1861.

I have also prepared a very lucid and explicit account book, in
which all the Africans, their guardians, the clothes given out, board
money paid to the close of the year, and every thing else connected 
with them is fairly set forth. This appears to be appreciated, as well 
as the readiness with which I render every facility necessary for the 
carrying on of thew work thus taken out of my hands. A matter
which is much appreciated by the authorities here, is the economy
with which I was enabled to meet the expenses of these Africans
during the four months I had the disbursements under my own
control. * * * * * *

I have the pleasure to be,
Your obedient servant,
John Seys,
U.S. Agent Liberated Africans.







Letters from Liberia.

From Rev. C. C. Hoffman.





Ship M. C. Stevens,
December 11, 1860.

Rev. R. R. Gurley,

My Dear Brother:—You will be glad to learn of our safe arrival
on the coast of Africa.

After a voyage of thirty-three days from Cape Henry, we made, 
on Monday at noon, the high and beautiful land at Camp Mount.
We cast anchor in the evening, and this morning the Captain, Dr.
Hall, and a few of the passengers, went on shore. I conversed with
a number of the settlers, and without exception found them contented 
and happy. Both they, as well as the Doctor (Cooper,) spoke of the
healthfulness of the settlement. I saw nothing to render it unhealthy.
The town, now numbering about eighty houses, appears well from the
sea. The houses are scattered amid the green trees, along the hill
side. The hill rises to the height of nearly 1,100 feet. The water is
excellent, and the land fertile.

I visited the Receptacle where now most of the recaptured slaves
live. Of those landed in Liberia, 289 have been sent to Cape
Mount: of these 31 have died, (most of them were sick when they
landed;) and 24 had run away, been enticed away by the natives.
Those remaining seemed in a pretty good condition. They were
under daily instruction, both in school and in the cultivation of the 
land. The teacher spoke of them as being docile, and many of them
as showing a desire for instruction.

The arrival of all these recaptives should make an important feature
in future missionary operations. A portion, at least, of the representatives 
from different tribes should be taken to the mission schools,
in the hope and with the object of training them for teachers and
ministers for their own distant people.

I shall make an application for the three native children who were
taken in the Kibby and detained some months in New York, and
who are now on board our vessel. They are intelligent little fellows.

We have had a good voyage and a pleasant one: no accident has
occurred, and no serious sickness. We have had, daily, morning and
evening prayer, both in the cabin and among the emigrants. our
passengers are all well, and my little daughter has enjoyed the
voyage and improved in health. The captain and officers have been
faithful to duty and kind and attentive to all.

I shall continue my letter as I reach other ports.

On the 12th of December we reached Monrovia, landed thirteen
of our emigrants, and sent twenty-five to Careysburg. As most of 
the freight was to be landed, and Dr. Hall had business with the 
Government, we remained here a fortnight. During this time we
made frequent visits on shore. The people were polite and attentive.
We had the pleasure of dining with the President, and taking breakfast
with the ex-President, Mr. Roberts. The legislature was in 
session, and we attended occasionally the sittings. I was pleased to



meet the Senators and Representative from Cape Palmas. The
Steamer Seth Grosvenor came in while we were there, bringing the
mails from the Leeward Settlements. Letters from our missionaries
gave us the glad news of their good health and happiness.

Just before we left our ladies, with Dr. Hall and our Captain, 
accompanied by Dr. McGill, Mrs. Benedict, Ex-President Roberts 
and Mrs. Roberts, took a trip up the St. Paul's River, as far as Washington's,
just above Millsburg. We were all delighted with the beautiful
river, but most with the thriving farms and comfortable houses along
its banks. We stopped at Mr. Anderson's, and visited his sugar
mill. He was preparing to grind: last year he made 60,000 pounds,
and expects to make 80,000 next year. On ascending the river, we
stopped at Mr. Roberts' farm, and took lunch under the trees; and
coming down, we drew our three boats together, and under the shady
bank refreshed ourselves again. our time did not allow us to accept
the invitations which we received to stop and dine. Instead of returning
through Stockton Creek we continued down the St. Paul's,
and passed out of the bar, which we did without any difficulty.

We were all delighted with the trip, and rejoiced to observe the
prosperity of the settlers. It was Saturday, market-day, and we
counted upwards of sixty canoes taking produce to market at Monrovia.
Most of the farmers cultivate the cane. The Coopers have
another steam mill for grinding it. They made on their own farm
last season 40,000 pounds of sugar.

You will be glad to learn that I visited Careysburg. In company
with the Rev. G. W. Gibson, I left Monrovia at 7 o'clock in the 
morning. We reached Mr. Washington's at one, and then started
off in a southeast direction to  travel twelve miles. The road was 
rough, and much overgrown: some six or eight bridges are still
needed, in place of the logs which are now the only means of crossing
the streams. There are three good bridges made near Careysburg,
but unfortunately the contracts made with the road makers and the
bridge makers were such that both considered their work done,
before they had made the road on the level with the bridges, and as
a consequence the three good bridges which are built are from three
to six feet above the road level! The road is from ten to fifteen feet
wide; in the midst of it, among the stumps, is a foot-path, along
which we traveled. It was evening when we reached there. We 
were kindly received by Mr. Dennis, who has a good frame building
on the hill near the Receptacle. We remained till the next day at
noon. we had sufficient opportunity of viewing the place and visiting
some of the people. * * * The land seems fertile
and good, but the difficulty is to get produce to market: freight and
transportation would more than swallow up the profits. The settlers,
however, seemed to be contented and happy. The twenty-five who
left our ship were all pleased with the place, as well as those who
had been there a longer period. I saw George Burton, of the
McDonogh Estate, who reported his company well pleased; four had
died. Many who came out last spring have settled on the road,



towards the St. Paul's, for the distance of six miles. I visited a
number of them, and found them all well satisfied, though in one 
house I found three members of the family sick. * * *

The Congoes in this county seem to have been well managed by
Mr. Seys. They have been placed out in families, both in Monrovia
and the country. Some who have taken them are, it is true, persons
of no responsibility; but still, on the whole, under the circumstances,
I do not see that any thing better could have been done for them.
Now, if they rightly managed, they will become useful members of society.
The same pan has been pursued at Bassa, with equal success.

But at Sinou things are different. I think there were 380 landed
here. They are not Congoes, who seem a quiet, docile race, but the
representatives of half a dozen tribes—men of resolute and determined
spirit. There are Annagoes, Argis, Mobis, Barabas, and 
Housas. They have been kept together, and are living in thatched
houses at the entrance of the town. * * *

Neither of these [Bassa and Sinou] are places, in my opinion, for new 
settlers. Acclimated persons can occupy such places with advantage. If
an interior station could really be established, at a point (where the inhabitants
would not be buried by its inaccessibility,) of easy access, it
would be of vast importance to the interests of Liberia. Such a
place as, say Harrisburg, or the site of the Lutheran Mission, on the
St. Paul's; both of which places I visited. There is a fine hilly
country back of Bassa, but the bar of the river is almost always so
dangerous that it would be an objection. Of the interior from Sinou
I know little. The neighborhood of Cape Mount might afford some
such locality, for his settlement is decidedly a healthy one, comparatively
so at least. Cape Palmas also would furnish such positions.
Our interior station, near the Cavalla, sixty miles from its mouth, is
surrounded by fine hills—a rich and fertile soil.

Thirty-nine of the emigrants in this expedition go now to Palmas.
Among them, Robert Harris, the Phillipses, Parkers, Copeland, Tate,
Stewarts, and others. This settlement, next to the St. Paul's, seems
to me most important and prosperous. I hope you will direct the
attention of emigrants toward it. The Methodist Conference is to
be held there this month.

Dr. Hall is pretty well, but his daughter is not much improved in
health. My wife and Miss Marrion, with our babe, are all well.
We expect to reach Palmas to-morrow.

Palmas, January 9.—We arrived on the 4th. Things look well
and more thriving in Harper than I have ever known before. Dr. 
Hall and myself went as far as Tubman town to-day. We had unexpected
news on our arrival,⁸the expected departure of Mr. and 
Mrs. Rambo, on account of Mrs. R.'s health. Mr. and Mrs. Crummell
also return with their family, and Miss Ball expects to be married to
a German missionary, and to leave on the 16th in the steamer for Accra.

18th.—The Stevens sails to-day, and I must close, with assurance
of Christian love, in which my wife joins.

I am, dear sir, yours faithfully in Christ
C. C. Hoffman.







Letters from Liberia.

From Rev. B. R. Wilson.





Monrovia, February 26, 1861.

Rev. R. R. Gurley:

Dear Friend and Brother:— * * It affords me the
highest gratification to hear from you at all times, or to receive a line
from you; and I sincerely hope that you will not fail to favor me as
you have done, and whenever opportunity offers I will not fail to give
you all the information of our country in my power.

As to myself, from exposure in traveling among the native tribes 
in 1859, my health commenced declining, so much so that in 1860 
I was compelled to retire from the public service of the Church, for
the purpose, if possible, to recover my health; and would have visited
the United States for that purpose if my circumstances would have
justified it. For the most part of lats year, I was under a physician,
and my health has partially returned. But I doubt whether I shall
ever be able to enter fully into the work of the Church again, but I 
do not intend to be idle or to cease to be a missionary in Africa; and
for that purpose I have selected forty native children or youths, of
both sexes, upon whom I intend to bestow as much of my time 
and labor as my circumstances will admit of. My object is to civilize and 
christianize them, and learn them to work for their living.

In your communication you requested me to give you my views of
colonization, and things growing out of that operation; and if, after
twenty-seven years residence in this country, I entertain the same
favorable views of the whole scheme as I formerly did. In the first
place, I must say that I am not competent for the task. The cause
demands a much abler hand than mine; but, however, I am fully
convinced, (more now than ever before,) that the whole scheme was
and is one of the great operations of Divine Providence. This is to
me more and more developed every year, and must bet to every
unprejudiced mind of eye, which is favored with the knowledge of
things as they exist in Liberia or on the Western Coast of Africa.
Civilization is extending its gracious influence along the coast more
and more every year, and also penetrating the interior to an immense 
distance. There are more natives than emigrants from the United 
States and other countries, who speak the English language. Almost
every day new fields are opening up for missionary operations, and it 
can be plainly seen that God is preparing the way for a great and
glorious revival of religion in Africa. Two natives have entered the
Liberia Annual Conference this yea, one of whom I brought in from
the interior when he was only eight years of age. Others are occupying
lower stations in the Church. So far, our labor is not in vain.

And a great deal is being done in the way of civilization by the
individual families of Liberia; for there are from one to twenty
native children and adults, almost, in every family in Liberia. They
are with us in Church and State, around the Sacrament Table and at 
the family altar: they are speaking the same language, governed by
the same laws, and worshipping the same God with ourselves; and



it is the pride of our best citizens to elevate them to a seat in their 
social circles.

The Congoes brought into this Republic by the United States
squadron, at first created some little excitement with some of our
citizens, but the course adopted by the United States Agent, Rev.
John Seys, in placing them in the families of the citizens, as far as
it was practicable, has banished all their fears, and seems to work
gloriously. Numbers of the children are attending Sabbath schools
and public service every Sabbath, and are learning rapidly. To me
this is another evidence of the workings of Divine Providence.

I was happy to have the honor of taking a part in the arduous
labors, with my old friend Mr. Seys, in his disposition of the great 
number of these recaptives which were placed under his care. Mrs.
Seys, wife of the Rev. John Seyes, has distinguished herself in assisting
her husband in taking care of the miserable thousands which
were placed here. Her labors have been astonishing to all, and one
could be led to believe that God had sent her here for the special
crisis. The noble act of the United States Congress in their very
liberal appropriation, has enabled this Government and its citizens
to bestow upon these miserable sufferers that care which their 
condition demands:—all of which I hope will work to the glory
of God and the up-building of our down-trodden race.

I cannot close this very short communication without some 
expression in relation to yourself and the great work in which you so
long have been engaged; and it is my firm belief that there will be
many to rise up in the Day to come and call you blessed. your
labors in this good work have been and are such as will win for you
laurels which Angels might covet:—you having been among the first
to advocate the great scheme of Colonization.

We have had another visit from our old and tried friend, Mr. Hall;
we are always glad to see him. I have to close, and leave much unsaid
that I wish to say; but I will save it for the next time.

With much respect, I remain your most humble servant in Christ
B. R. Wilson.

Mr. H. W. Dennis, Agent of the Society, writes to the Financial 
Secretary, under date of Monrovia, February 28, 1861:

"Yours by the M. C. Stevens came duly to hand, and contents
noted. A number of the emigrants went to Cape Palmas, and a
family to Grand Bassa. One family stops at this place, and the 
remainder are located at Careysburg. The road is in progress, and 
may be completed before the return of the ship. The Government
was pleased, after Dr. Hall's arrival here, to contract for it with Dr.
Daniel Laing, and not at a public auction. I am very glad,
however, that the road is going ton, and the prospect is fair that we 
will be able to use our wagon and cart upon it before the year is out.



"The two sugar mills have been disposed of, as well as the four
cauldrons. * * Quite a number of persons have requested
me to order for them a small sugar mill and two boilers, just like the
ones you sent this time, and to cost the same. our people often call
for the above articles, and some have requested me to order some for
them. And now, since they have so many Congoes to help them 
work, their calls are more frequent and urgent."

Also, from Mr. J. H. Dennis, dated Careysburg, February 20, 1861:

"Many who were expected by the last arrival to come here, were
persuaded to go with those who came out for Sinou and Cape Palmas,
which lessened our number to twenty-four. Though few in number,
they are a great addition to our settlement, and will become good
citizen, having been very industrious since their arrival, in cleaning
their lands and erecting their houses. Two families have moved into 
their houses this month, and three or four more expect to move within 
two weeks. There have been no deaths up to this date, and but  
little sickness. I hope they will suffer less than the previous 
company. The Cuthbert family are getting along as well as could be 
expected."

From J. H. Deputie.

Tracy Receptacle, Robertsport, February 12, 1861.

Rev. and Dear Sir: * * *

"We were once more greatly disappointed, on the arrival of the 
ship, by receiving no emigrants for our almost forsaken settlement.
We hope, and look forward with blessed anticipation, that the day is
not far distant when our little settlement shall flourish by the accession
of emigrants, and the work of civilization be promoted; and not
only that we but others around us may realize a glorious result. I respectfully
solicit your attention to this momentous point, and hope
that you will use your influence towards the promotion of our settlement,
and let us have a few more people among us, and see what can
be done towards opening settlements up the rivers that surround us.

* * * The recaptives are now in the hands of this
Government, which is to carry out the agreement of the Society and
the U.S. Government, and of which you will shortly hear.

"While the recaptives were under the auspices of the Society,
they attended school under my supervision, and I am glad to say I
could report progress. At the expiration of my last quarter, many
of them could read in primary readers and spell in two, three and
four letters. you will perceive by the roll containing their names
and ages, that they are mostly young, which renders their minds



more susceptible of receiving instruction. The Echoites are doing
well, and of the twenty-five that came to this place none have died.

"In conclusion, I would recommend to you the necessity of having 
the Receptacle reshingled, as the rains will soon commence and the
house is in a very lakey condition." * *

From Nathaniel Brooks.

"Mt. Tubman, Cape Palmas, January 1, 1861.

"Reverend Sir:

"I received your letter on the 16th ult., which found me in good
health: I hope that these few lines when they reach you may find
you the same. I feel thankful for your continuation of correspondence.
When I read your letter I was astonished to hear of the unbelief
of my colored friends.

"Our crops are prosperous for the ensuing year, and great 
tranquility prevails at present. There is a great revival in the Methodist
Church.

"I will send you twelve canes, in the care of Dr. Hall; please
walk with one of them yourself, and please give on to Mr. —,
and distribute the others to the rest of the Patriarchs of the Society.

"The Episcopal Mission has built a house up the Cavalla River,
about eighty or ninety miles distant. It is a beautiful river, and I
think it would make an excellent settlement for emigrants, as it is
well timbered, mountainous and healthy. There is room enough
here to accommodate thousands of my colored friends.

"I have been in this country so long, that I expect the people of
Georgetown and Washington think that I am dead; but tell them
that I am well, and doing well, and invite all to come. Please send
me a journal occasionally."

Extracts from message of President Benson.

The Liberia Herald of December 5, 1860, says:

We publish in this number the Message of the President, delivered
to-day to the Legislature, which convened on the 3d instant. The
Message was listened to attentively by a full house; and it seemed
that there was general satisfaction with the views and policy contained in it.
We hope the Legislature will give to each subject contained
in the Message that consideration which its importance demands.



Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:

* * * *
Your last and highly commendable short session afforded me the
necessary time to have prosecuted, before the termination of the dry
season, the purpose which I signified to you in my last annual
message, "of effecting, during the last dry season, a demolition of the 
barricades of some of our aborigines, especially at Cape Mount and
New Cess; and of establishing peace among them, as far as could be,
on a permanent basis." I am pleased to say, that my expectations
were more than met, without the least hostile demonstration; and the
fruits have been eminently manifested in the unusual and profitable 
increase of our commerce during the past year.

There are one or two chiefs living in the interior, some instance
north of Cape Mount, whose misunderstandings remain yet to be
adjusted, which, for want of time, could not be attended to last dries.
But as they are anxious for government interposition, and have sent
several solicitations, I apprehend no difficulty in having them all
arranged early in the dries, provided the Superintendent at Robertsport
shall not have previously succeeded. In fact, though there are
some minor misunderstandings among several clans along the coast,
yet the only case that seems to have particularly assumed such an
aspect as now to require prompt action on the part of this government,
is the misunderstanding and hostile relations subsisting between the
Po River and Padae people, living thirty or forty miles to the northwest
of Cape Palmas, to which, and especially the obligations of the 
government to the latter, growing out of treaty stipulations, I have 
more than once invited your attention. The efforts of which I made
mention in my last annual message, that were being employed by the
Superintendent of Maryland County, and the bright prospect he then 
had of success in adjusting the difficulties between those tribes, (the
former having promised to remove to their own domain,) have all 
proved abortive; and I am informed that the impression of the leading 
men of that County is that nothing short of the employment of 
force will effect the object, which they regard as indispensable. I
have therefore to request, that if what you may learn in addition on 
this subject, from the representatives from that County now present,
be such as to justify it, you will authorize the coercive removal of the
aggressors, and that you make appropriation sufficient for employing
the requisite military force.

Should you deem it necessary to employ a force for the purpose
aforesaid, it will no doubt be the mans also of quieting two or three
factious tribes in that vicinity, and of putting an effectual stop to the
cruel, heathenish practice of administering the poison of saucy wood,
which still obtains among some of the aborigines living in the vicinity
of our settlements in that County. Several cases of a most revolting 
nature occurred this year, for which the perpetrators should be punished. 
The time has come when such homicidal practices by natives
living (at least) within the vicinity of our settlements, should be
promptly checked. If this government has the right and power to
stop it, (which I presume no one will deny,) then it becomes a moral



duty, and the neglect of such a duty involves moral delinquency and
national guilt.

I am gratified to be able to state, that this new Representative Hall,
commenced the latter part of last year, is now completed, at a cost of
$4,389, and is acknowledged to be the best public building in the
Republic. The second story has been laid off into commodious public
offices, which saves the expense of the rent of two buildings for that 
purpose, to which government was previously subjected. * *

The spirit of agricultural industry has increased most encouragingly. 
Several of the leading articles of domestic provisions have never in
the history of Liberia been more abundant and cheap, than they
were last, and have been the present year. And the production
of exportable articles by our civilized communities this year, will be
more than two hundred per cent. in advance of the preceding year.
It affords me pleasure to say that the National Fair, instituted a few
years ago by your patriotism and wisdom, has, as was but reasonable
to suppose, largely contributed to the industrial interest of the Republic.
It is an institution which every intelligent patriot will ever
duly appreciate; an institution in which the great masses—particularly
the laboring classes of our citizens—take the liveliest interest,
because they regard it particularly as their own; one at which they
can (though occupying an humble position in life) honorably demonstrate
their manliness and patriotism, by an exhibition of samples
of what they are doing, not only for the comfort of themselves and
families, but also for the substantial prosperity of Liberia. And I
cordially endorse the very judicious and patriotic sentiment of the
respected chairman of the intelligent Adjudicating Committee of the
last Fair,—'That every cent expended on the National Fair yields
to Liberia a thousand fold." Much is due to several warm friends
of Liberia in the United States, for contributing so liberally in 
facilitating the development of the productive industry of this Republic,
by the timely supply of machinery, &amp;c., &amp;c., on very accommodating
terms. * * * *

I have already intimated that there has been a manifest increase
during the year in our commerce, at an advance of nearly fifty per
cent. over the preceding year. This has arisen from the increased 
production by our aborigines, as well as civilized communities. While
the former have unusually devoted themselves to the production of
palm oil, dye-woods, cotton cloths, &amp;c., the latter have been equally
diligent in the production of sugar, syrup, molasses and coffee. And
though the quantity may as yet be regarded as comparatively small,
yet the annual increase is very encouraging. And if government 
should continue to be so fortunate in its efforts for the preservation
of peace and the suppression of the slave trade among the aborigines,
there is no doubt that their devotion to legitimate industrial pursuits
will most gratifyingly increase with each succeeding year.

By reference to statistics in the Report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, it will be seen that more than fifty per cent. of the commerce 
of this Republic is carried on with the United States of
America. Considering that Liberia is the offspring of American



benevolence, and the fact that we have brought with us to these
shores the language, religion, and to some extent the customs and
manners of that people, it were natural to suppose that the avenues
to the development of our commerce, so far as foreign instrumentality
was expected to operate, would first emanate from and lead to that
country. And it cannot be denied that Liberia has striven earnestly,
and struggled hard, during the entire length of time we have existed
as a sovereign state, to establish and perpetuate that comity, that 
international and commercial intercourse of reciprocity, so indispensable
for successfully promoting the commercial interest of the citizens of
both nations. These efforts on the part of this government, instead
of being seconded in a spirit of just reciprocity by that government,
have, up to this date, been treated indifferently, if not contemptuously, 
either by silence to the appeals of this government, or by an indirect 
assurance, that while the administration of that government entertains 
the best feeling toward Liberia, and would be happy to do whatever
it consistently can to promote our national interests, finds it impracticable
and impolitic, in the present agitated state of that country
on the all-absorbing "peculiar institution" question, to treat with us 
fully as a sovereign state, or even to temporarily regulate the 
commercial intercourse of the citizens of the two countries under the 
act of Congress which invests the President of that Republic with
the prerogative, in the absence of treaties subsisting with any government,
to admit and treat the citizens and vessels of such nation,
within the jurisdiction of the United States, on terms of reciprocity.

It is for you to determine at this session, if after its close it cane be 
regarded any longer as politic, or even just, for this government to
accord such commercial privileges to citizens of the United States,
as are accorded to citizens of the most favored nations with which we
have treaties of friendship and commerce, based upon principles of
reciprocity, when the United States Government refuses to accord to
us similar privileges. Can this government any longer, in justice to 
itself, to its citizens, and to those nations with which we have treaties
of reciprocity, consistently recognize the pursuit of such a policy of
commercial intercourse with the United States as virtually prevents
our citizens, in their own vessels, from profitably participating in the
commerce of that country, and throws open our ports and line of sea
coast of the citizens and ships of that nation, for an unrestricted and
profitable trade within the jurisdiction of this Republic?

Infant and feeble nation as we are, and emanating form them, it
was to be expected that the magnanimity of that government would
have voluntarily consented to accord to us, in our struggle for national
life amidst great difficulties, commercial privileges more favorable
than those received from us. It is impossible for Liberian merchants,
in their own vessels, to succeed in honest competition in the United
States, under the great pressure of existing discriminating duties.

* * * * * *

Agreeably to your resolution, approved January 14, 1860, a 
contract for one year has been entered into between the Secretary of the
Treasury and the owners of the steamer Seth Grosvenor, to go into



effect the 1st of January proximo, for monthly, and when practicable,
semi-monthly, cruises from this port to the river San Pedro,  touching 
at the ports of entry and the principal intermediate points, each trip
up and down the coast, to convey the mails, also government officers,
troops and property, when required, and to assist in guarding our
line of coast against infractions of the navigation, commerce and
revenue laws of this Republic, and especially the revival of the nefarious
slave trade. I will not here attempt to enumerate the items
of service stipulated to be rendered, as a copy of the contract, if 
desired, will be transmitted to you. In consideration of the service
stipulated to be rendered, the government has agreed to pay them
the sum of three thousand dollars per annum; government reserving
to itself the privilege of abrogating the contract, provided the line of 
British Mail Steamers should, at any time during the year, cease to
touch at Cape Palmas. The Quail will be kept, during the year,
cruising for the same purpose, mostly between this port and Shebar,
our northwestern boundary. This has become highly necessary, since 
the vigilance and late success of American cruisers, in making 
captures on the south coast have resulted in the attempt to revive that
piratical traffic, the slave trade, on our coast.

On the 2d of November, and within four hours after the receipt of 
the despatch from Mr. Superintendent Stryker, of Cape Mount, informing 
me of the fact, I despatched the Quail to Gallinas and 
Solyma, in search of a slaver reported to have been cruising off those 
notorious slave marts of past days, and had been seen for a week or 
more, running into land each afternoon and going to sea in the morning. 
The Quail was ordered to call via Cape Mount, and take up 
Mr. Superintendent Stryker to Gallinas and Solyma, whom I had 
instructed to land and visit the chiefs, of whom and the places at 
which it was reported slaves were being accumulated; and to gather a
ll the information he could as to the fact, and to threaten the chiefs 
with severe punishment if a slave was permitted to be shipped from 
that region. The Superintendent had interviews with the principal 
chiefs: Prince Manna, of Gallinas, professed to know nothing about 
the slaver, except from report. He said that he had permitted none 
to land or operate in Gallinas territory. The chiefs of Solyma 
acknowledged that a number of doubloons had been landed from the 
vessel, which had proceeded to the leeward to be back in a week or 
two; but that they never intended to pay a farthing of the money 
they had received; that they never intended a slave to be shipped off 
from there, because they knew it would bring on them a chastisement 
by this government. The Superintendent learned that some few 
Spaniards had been landed from the vessel and were on shore, 
secreted up some of the rivers, and he reported to me soon after the 
result of his mission.

I immediately, under date of 12th November, wrote to Prince 
Manna, in positive terms, that he was implicated in the matter, and 
his pleading ignorance amounted to nothing; that the Spaniards, 
and such slaves, if any, as may have been accumulated, must be given 
up to the Commissioner; and in the event of his refusing to do so,



or allowing a slave to be shipped off from that region, he would be 
severely punished, and perhaps driven entirely out of that country by 
a military force, which this government would feel compelled, in 
such case, to employ. * * * That part of our coast 
snail be diligently guarded, especially until that vessel has been either 
captured or left our coast. And Prince Manna and other chiefs will 
be held accountable for any implication or delinquency in the present 
as well as future cases. He must be taught, by whatever means will 
prove most effectual, the obligations of allegiance he is under to this 
government. Had the affair not occurred within a few days of your 
session, I would have sent up a sufficient force and brought those 
Spaniards down. My reason for presenting this matter in detail to 
you, is simply that you may be cognizant of a case that may be 
attempted to be repeated within the jurisdiction of this Republic more 
than once within the next twelve months, and to invite your attention 
to the propriety of making a sufficient appropriation, and authorizing 
the raising of a sufficient force, military or otherwise, in the rainy or 
dry season, for the purpose of demanding and arresting such pirates 
in future, upon a moment's warning of Liberia's soil being polluted 
by such incarnate demons. Prompt, and when necessary, summary 
action on shore, both with the chiefs and foreign slavers, will be the 
only effectual means of causing a cessation of future piratical visits to 
our coast. 

I have repeatedly invited the attention of the Legislature to the 
necessity of providing a criminal code of laws for this Republic. 
Until within the last eighteen months, the criminal law of England, 
so far as was applicable to our republican form of government, was in 
general use. But since that period it has been decided by the judges 
that the criminal law of England is not enforcible in this Republic, 
since there is no existing statute adopting it as a part of our laws.

The House of Representatives did, in 1858, adopt a resolution, 
appointing three gentlemen to draft a criminal code; but the resolution 
being the exclusive action of the House, could not be regarded 
as law, and consequently the gentlemen designated declined serving. 
It will greatly endanger the security of life, property and liberty, in 
this Republic, to defer this matter any longer. I recommend the 
immediate adoption of the criminal law of the United States, or of 
England, so far as applicable to our condition—at least until a criminal 
code can be drafted, for which I hope you will make provision 
without delay. 

The Journals of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
commencing from the Declaration of Independence, up to your last session, 
have been, during the year, corrected and legibly transcribed, in 
excellent substantial books, in conformity to your resolution, approved 
February 24,1859, authorizing and requesting the same. I shall be 
pleased to have you appoint a committee for their inspection. 

I shall transmit to you, in a day or two, a communication from the 
State Department, inviting your attention to the equal, if not paramount, 
propriety of authorizing an immediate transcription, in permanent 
books, of the old Colonial records and documents of interest,



which will embrace a period of about a quarter of a century. Those 
records have been, for years, in a very shattered condition, and will, 
in a few more years, be entirely lost to us, if not transcribed very 
soon; the loss of which would be deeply lamented throughout the 
future of Liberia. * * *

Nothing to my knowledge has occurred during the year, to interrupt 
the tranquility of our foreign relations. In view of the great 
anxiety and expense to which this infant State was subjected, (at 
least for three or four years,) immediately after the Declaration of 
our Independence, which trouble and expense grew mainly, if not 
entirely, out of misrepresentations made to foreign governments, 
respecting the policy of this infant State in matters which affected the 
interest of their citizens, I have striven earnestly during my entire 
administration to prevent, as far as I could, even the possibility of 
misrepresentation; and I am pleased to say, that excepting the 
misstatements in the Regina Cœli's case, which have been long since 
corrected, and the policy and character of this government satisfactorily 
vindicated, this government has succeeded in its cherished desire.

No honorable means will be neglected during my future administration 
to cultivate, strengthen and perpetuate the most friendly 
feelings in our foreign relations; and if I should be thwarted, it will 
only be by a well studied plan of mischievous misrepresentation, 
which may be for a time beyond my control. 

I feel unwilling to close this communication without an allusion to 
the sad loss Liberia has sustained during the year, in the death of 
the Hon. A. D. Williams, ex Vice President of this Republic, and at 
the time of his death Superintendent at Robertsport; as also of the 
Hon. ex Senator John Hanson, Senator M. A. Rand, of Grand Bassa 
County, and Hon. Judge Hansford, of Sinou County. The loss of 
those faithful and patriotic public servants is very severely felt 
in Liberia. In fact, the rapid passing away annually of our leading 
men, would almost depress us beyond endurance, if we were not so 
encouragingly relieved by the brilliant genius, and the moral and 
patriotic characteristics, manifested by a respectable number of the 
young men, either born or raised up among us, who, I have no doubt, 
will by the blessing of a benign Providence, be fully prepared, in 
due time, to occupy our places, and acquit themselves honorably and 
creditably as public functionaries. 

I close this communication, gentlemen, with the assurance 
that you shall have my cordial co-operation, as far as may be required, 
in the discharge of the duties of this session.

Stephen Allen Benson.

Government House,
Monrovia, December 5, 1860.



The Liberia Herald of December 19, 1860, publishes the 
proceedings of the Board of Directors of the American Colonization Society 
of October 25th, on the subject of the Recaptured Africans, and 
says, in relation to the visit of the bearer of these proceedings to the 
Government of Liberia, Dr. James Hall:

Doctor James Hall, of Baltimore, than whose name none other stands 
more prominent on the long list of Liberia's foreign friends, is at this time 
paying us a visit: The Doctor is an old, thoroughly tried and well proved 
friend of Liberia. He has ever evinced an unswerving energy, as well in the 
organizing and founding of measures tending to promote Liberia's welfare, as 
a sterling zeal in carrying forward and promoting every possible plan aiming 
at her real interest. This character, so worthily deserved, is universally 
accorded to the Doctor by the entire Liberian public.

The name of Dr. James Hall will occupy no small place in the future history 
of Liberia. Thirty years the Doctor has been variously and most intimately 
connected with Liberia and Liberian affairs. 

The Resolutions copied in another column of this present issue, will give 
information as to the ostensible object of the Doctor's present visit to us; thus,

although now the evening of his days draws upon him, he is still actively 
giving himself to his cherished cause—the interest of Liberia.

The Doctor is accompanied by his daughter, Miss Caroline, who, as also 
the Doctor, is in feeble health, and visits this climate with the hope of improving.

We wish for them both a full realization of this hope.

From the Herald of the same date we select the following articles:

Rev. E. W. Blyden intends paying a visit to his mother and family in his 
native place, St. Thomas, West Indies. Mr. Blyden will probably leave in 
the next month's mail steamer, and will spend a short time in visiting some of 
the principal parts of England, before going to the West Indies. He will also 
visit the Canadas and the United States. The Presbyterian Church here have
commissioned Mr. B. a delegate to the General Assembly to be held in 
Philadelphia in May next.

We have been informed that the Rev. E. W. Stokes has received a call from 
the Episcopal Church in the United States, inviting him to go to Hayti to take 
part in the organization of an independent Episcopal Diocese, intended to be 
established there. 

Death.—Rev. H. Green, Sinou. By the Seth Grosvenor we have received 
the sad intelligence of the demise of the Rev. Hezekiah Green, within the month, 
minister in charge of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Sinou. Mr. Green 
died of consumption, from which he had been suffering for several years.

From the same paper, of January 2, 1861, we copy the following:

Prince Marmora, or Boatswain.—This chief, after a lapse of five years, 
has made another visit to our capital; arriving here on the 29th ult., he immediately

waited on the President and made known the object of his visit. From 



this same chief we procured some of our allies in the Sinou war, and his 
present visit, also, is in some way connected with aiding the Government in
carrying out its purposes. Marmora was sent as a deputy by a number of 
chiefs in the interior, to confer with this Government in reference "to keeping
the path open," to the interior, and to obtain the promise of the Government to 
assist him in procuring property that may be fraudulently brought away by 
his subjects, and also to provide that subjects committing other crimes be not 
allowed to escape justice. The chief is followed by a retinue exceeding 
one hundred; of which his band, composed of five horns, (four of ivory and one of

wood,) two drums, and three cymbals, with several vocal singers to accompany
the cymbals, forms a part. The chief is noble in appearance, although not as
tall as many of his subjects. When visiting, either on business of State or 
privately, he is accompanied, not by his whole retinue, but only his principal
officers, and his demeanor is in accordance with the dignity of his position. 
The last was a year for the visits of princes, and Liberia has had her share of 
the visits.

The Dinner.—To-day we were present at a dinner given by our fellow-citizen, 
Dr. S. P. McGill, at his residence; there were many gentlemen of high 
standing present; and it is easy to imagine our glad surprise when, on entering 
the reception room, we saw the Chief of whom we have just spoken, Marmora, 
present also. At the table there was a toast drank in honor of the Chief, who 
replied in English, in a very appropriate manner. The presence of the Chief 
seemed to have given the guests as much pleasure as the good things under 
which the table (and some of the guests afterwards) groaned. We were delighted 
with this feature of the dinner, and the attempt to pay honor to our 
princely visitor was suggested by a noble idea. The dinner was completed at 
8 o'clock, and the company dispersed, all well pleased with the enjoyment of 
the day.

The "Saratoga" again.—We are pleased to announce the appearance in 
our harbor of this man-of-war. It has been sixteen or seventeen years since 
we first saw this vessel here, on her mission of assisting to break up the slave 
trade on the west coast of Africa. The Commander, Captain Taylor, who 
visited Liberia in the Cyane about twenty years ago, is the same good-hearted 
gentleman that he then was, and appears to be a man of determined energy and 
zeal. His officers, also, appear to be of the right kind. We wish for this
vessel also the good fortune of gathering her "New Year's gift," in the 
capture of slavers.

Officers of the U.S. Sloop of War Saratoga.—Commander, Alfred Taylor;
First Lieutenant, J. J. Guthrie; Second Lieutenant, C. W. Hayes; Third 
Lieutenant, J. S. Skerrett; Fourth Lieutenant, F. M. Ramsay; Surgeon, R. 
W. Jeffery; Assistant Surgeon, J. E. Lindsay; Paymaster, J. N. Carpenter; 
Master, H. H. Dalton; Marine Officer, 1st Lieut. H. B. Tyler; Midshipman, 
N. H. Farquhar; Carpenter, J. W. Stimson; Gunner, R. H. Cross; Sailmaker, 
G. W. Frankland; Boatswain, George Smith; Captain's Clerk, Benjamin R. 
Spekell; Paymaster's Clerk, F. G. Rowe; Master's Mates, Lewis Rogers, A. 
P. Matthews. Passengers, Lt. E. K. Owen, Lt. L. A. Beardslee.



Also, from the same, dated February 6, 1861:

Padee Expedition.—Agreeably to an act passed by the Legislature at its 
last session, authorizing the employment of an armed force to quell the rebellious

movements of the Po River or Naffau Tribes, in Maryland County, a
detachment from the First Regiment of 225 men, left this place on the 4th inst. 
under the command of Lieut. Col. Isaac Lawrence, for Harper, Maryland: 
this detachment will also be joined by 50 men from the Second Regiment at 
Bassa. 

The troops went down on board of the Government Schooner Quail, 
the Steamer Seth Grosvenor, and the Schooner Randall. His Excellency President 
Benson accompanied the troops. Capt. S. C. Fuller, of the Johnson Guard, 
and the Hon. J. T. Gibson, Superintendent of Maryland County, will be Aids 
to His Excellency.

We wish for the expedition a highly successful issue.

Death or the Rev. E. P. Rodgers.—We have learned, with deep regret, 
of the death of the Rev. E. P. Rodgers, at Cape Palmas, about the 19th ult.

Mr. Rodgers will be remembered as one of the three gentlemen who recently 
touched at this port, on board of Captain Alexander's vessel, on their way to 
prosecute the exploration in the Yoruba Country begun by Dr. Delany 
and Mr. Campbell, in behalf of the African Civilization Society. It was Mr. 
Rodgers who so agreeably entertained our townsfolks on the evening of the 
12th of December, in the M. E. Church, by the rehearsal of his Poem—"A 
man's a man for a' that." 

Mr. Rodgers and his co-travelers were awaiting the arrival of the packet at 
Cape Palmus.

During Mr. R.'s short stay at this place he expressed himself as deeply 
interested in our interest, and much attached to our people, who evinced great 
pleasure in welcoming and introducing him among all. We had the pleasure 
of his company on several occasions, and twice at our office, and discovered in 
him an appreciableness of character and ability. 

We join our sympathies with his friends in his native land, in mourning his loss.

The M. C. Stevens returned to this port on the 3d inst., from the leeward. 
After a stay of from three to four weeks, she will leave for the United States. 

Dr. Hall, and the Sinou River Falls.—During the stay of the Stevens, 
upward bound, at Sinou, Dr. Hall paid two visits to the Sinou River Falls 
or Rapids; first as a visit of curiosity, and second, in order to be with and assist

Superintendent Morris in selecting, laying out, and making general arrangements 
for the new settlement, designed to be made there by this Government, 
to which the recaptives now at Sinou are to be transferred. 

Lower Buchanan.—Bishop Payne, writing of Lower Buchanan, (Fishtown, 
Bassa,) calls it the "Fines! Port in Liberia," and regrets that it is "going rapidly

to decay." We endorse both sentiments.

Cape Palmas.—We extract the following from the "Cavalla Messenger"
for November last:

Business is brisk as yet here; the oil season is now coming on, and we look



soon to see long lines of native caravans of rice and oil. If cotton could be one

of our staples also, how soon would we command a large trade all along our 
coast! God speed the day when all our farmers will look to the raising of 
cotton in Liberia. 

We copy from the Herald of February 20th, the following notice 
of the death of Mrs. Benson:

"Yet mourn her not—the voice of wo 
Befits not this, her triumph-hour; 
Let Sorrow's tears no longer flow, 
For life eternal is her dower! 
Freed from the earth's corrupt control, 
The trials of a world like this, 
Joy! for her disembodied soul 
Drinks at the fount of perfect bliss!" 

At 8 o'clock, A. M., 16th inst., at the Mansion House, after considerable 
illness, died Mrs. Nancy Benson, the wife of His Excellency President Benson. 
As soon as the news of her death was heard, the public offices were closed, and 
the doors draped in mourning. The flags in town and on the vessels in harbor 
were half-masted the rest of the day. The funeral ceremonies commenced on 
the 17th, (Sunday,) at 11 o'clock. Previous to that time, the flags in the town 
and the harbor were again half-masted. A large concourse of citizens were 
present, officers of Government, and foreign Consuls. 

The religious ceremonies at the Mansion were conducted by Revs. Thomas 
Fuller, B. R. Wilson, and G. W. Gibson; after which, the Mayor of the city, 
Hon. B. V. R. James, formed the procession in the following order: 

1. The Clergy; 2. The Physicians; 3. The Foreign Consuls; 
4. The Members of the Cabinet; 
5. Pall-Bearers. } Corpse. { Pail-Bearers. 
6. Family of Deceased; 7. Ladies' Benevolent Society; 
8. Officers of the General Government and City Council; 
9. Citizens in general.

This long procession moved in solemn order to the grave-yard; and the 
corpse was deposited near where sleep many of the pioneers of Liberia—to 
remain there until the trumpet of the archangel shall summon it to arise, and 
put on a glorious immortality.

The ladies of Monrovia showed their appreciation of the worth of this noble 
woman, in arranging the drapery of the house, of the corpse, and doing willingly 
whatever female hands could find to do: for which they have our sincere 
thanks, and through us, the thanks of the husband of the deceased.

It was sad, when on the morning of the 16th inst., at the Mansion House, 
Mrs. Nancy Benson departed this life. It was sad, because we were so reluctant 
to part with her; and because we knew not that death would have so 
soon deprived us of such a friend. Mrs. Benson, in her last illness, as in most 
other cases of extreme sickness, was not favored with the presence of her husband;

public duty—an inexorable master—had called him away. When on 
the morning of the 5th inst., he embarked with the troop's for the seat of war, 
there was something that rested heavily on his mind, though he hoped for Mrs. 
Benson's recovery, from the signs of her improvement that were then manifest.


Mrs. Benson was in her fortieth year when she died; and for years she had 
been an acceptable member of the M. E. Church. From her earliest youth to



the grave, she was endued with a calm, holy spirit. Nothing of frivolity, 
nothing of vanity, was seen in her whole life. Her being seemed formed not 
for this world; for in the midst of the bustle of life, in prosperity and in 
adversity, in sickness and in health, she seemed as one unmoved by the affairs of

life, (only so far otherwise as God required,) seeking something that was not to 
be found in the hollow joys of earth. Do we speak too much? Let her bitterest 
enemies testify to the truth of what we have said. 

Lecture.—On the evening of the 15th instant, at the Representative Hall, 
Rev. Alexander Crummell lectured on "The English Language in Liberia." 
The subject was ably treated, and the discussion betrayed great depth of 
thought. After the lecture, it was resolved that the audience show their 
appreciation of the lecture by contributing an amount of money to be placed at 
the disposal of the lecturer. The sum of $32.42 was subscribed. We are 
happy to see this appreciation of literary merit; not because wisdom can be 
purchased with money, or because money is a fair equivalent for literary 
attainments; but because this spirit of appreciation has been so long and so sadly

wanting in Liberia; and because this want has tended, as much as any other 
cause, to stifle literary aspirations.

We beg to repeat our request, made in the last number, that our friends will 
endeavor to procure and send us natural curiosities of Africa, for the Museum 
in the Exhibition at London early next year. We repeat the request, because 
the object aimed at in forming the African Aid Society, and in procuring in 
the Exhibition a place for its African Museum, is one that deserves and demands 
the furtherance of every friend of the African Races. We hope Liberians 
will not be the last to manifest an interest in such matters.
