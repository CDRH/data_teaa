No 21

United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda Dec 13 1864

Sir,

I have the honor to acknowledge 
the reception of your 
Despatch No 2. with enclosures, requesting
information on a claim 
preferred by a British Seaman 
named George Frank, for the sum
of £9.17.6.

To facilitate the information,
I enclose George Frank's 
Account Current with the late 
Commercial Agent, taken from 
the Relief Book which shows 
a balance due him of $35.50 
and not £9.17.6. as represented 
by the British Consul at this 
city

Hon. Wm H Seward
Secretary of State
Washington



city.

The difference of amounts 
arise from not deducting one 
month's extra wages in accordance 
with the laws of United States' 
Consulates, and for not charging 
George Frank with Vouch No. 3 &amp; 4.

I respectfully enclose 
Vouchers No 1 to 5. Number 5 being 
only a copy the original having 
been misplaced by my predecessor,
as every place in the 
Agency has been searched for 
it the past two days. As 
the British Vice Consul took 
a copy of the original as seen 
by the enclosures forwarded 
to this Agency by the Depart
-ment



-ment, there cannot be any 
doubt as to its correctness.

I have the honor
to be
Your Most Obd't Serv't
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
