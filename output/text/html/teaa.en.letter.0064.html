St Paul de Loanda July 28th 1865.

Sir

I have the honor to report 
my return to this City and that 
I reassumed the duties of my 
Office on the 1st Inst.

Despatches Nos 3, 4 and 5 have 
been received at this Agency as also
Circular No 56 and the orders of the 
Department of April 17th to wear 
mourning in honor to the memory of 
our illustrious Chief Magistrate.

Mr F. A. Silva has made up 
the accounts of the two previous 
Quarters and has drawn on 
the Hon Secretary of 
the


Hon William H. Seward
Secretary of State
Washington




the Treasury for the balance of 
Salary awarded by Government 
to this Agency as if regularly 
appointed by the Department.

I observe however by Despatch 
No 5. the Department expects his 
compensation to be taken out of 
the enrollments of this office 
which only amounted during 
the two Quarters to $36.66.

This Province has completely 
recovered from the effects of the 
late Native War and Epidemic
of Small Pox. Trade has revived and 
very nearly approached the 
prosperity of the few years previous 
to 1860.

It is expected now as our Civil 



War is ended American Commerce
will return to this part of the 
Coast again which during the 
period above mentioned was of 
considerable importance and on 
the increase.

I have the honor
To be,
Your most Obed' Servt
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
