London May 10th 1865

Sir

In accordance with my Dispatch
to the Department of State
dated St Paul de Loanda December
31st 1864 informing you of my
unavoidable visit to this country
and my reasons for so doing. I
have the honor to say I arrived
here on the 4th ultimo and on
the 20th inst I return to my
post of duty upon Steamer 
via Lisbon.

While at Lisbon on my
way here I had the honor of
an interview with our minister Mr
Harvey and explained to him my
views on the necessity of creating
a Consulate at St Paul de Loanda
instead of a Commercial Agency.
I recommend this alteration not
with any motive of personal 
or pecuniary benefit, but
only that the representative of the
United States should at least rank
with Consuls of other nations

The British and
Brazilian

The Hon Secretary of State
Washington D.C.



Brazilian nations have first class
consuls there. The Portuguese
officials do not consider a Commercial
Agent  to a Consular
Agent, and it does not appear
to me to be in conformity
with the dignity of the United
States as a first class power,
to rank last and least in a
country situated so long or distance
from its Government, or its
representative in Portugal. Mr
Harvey impressed with the importance
of my representation
promised to draw your attention
to the subject. I therefor submit
these remarks in addition,
feeling convinced as now our unhappy
war is over. Commercial
prosperity with our part of the
coast of Africa and the United States
will be resumed on as prosperous a
note as before the war fully
justifying the  of Office
herein requested.

I have the honor
to be
Your most Obdt Servt
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
at
St. Paul de Loanda
