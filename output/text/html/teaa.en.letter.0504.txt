Date of leaving post. agreement
with Acting Vice Consul Judson Bond
of Mr Baines

Abstract of Contents

Same as above.



Department of State
Consular Bureau.

June 21st 1888.

Mr. Rives:

A. E. Baines was
apptd V.C. at St. P. Loando
March 2 '88, but the bond
sent by the Consul was returned
as irregular. He states that he 
has not recd notice of said
appointment &amp; therefore left the
office in charge of Judson. The
instn granting leave was of later date than the
one appointing the V.C.

Downing has charged for
full salary during transit but
until he produces an agreement
from Judson I dont see how
we can allow it.

F. O. St Clair



Dr St. Clair:
I can't take
Mr. Downing's word
about this.

Report as to the
other matters of 
V.C. in charge &amp;c

U.S. Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda, NY
June 16th, 1888.

Hon G. L. Rives
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of department's
despatch dated June 15th as well as a 
printed paper, "instructions to 
Consular Officers on leave."

Referring to said despatch,
I would report that I left my
Consular district on the 5th of
April, 1888. As regards the terms
of agreement between Mr. Judson
and myself, they are in effect, to
allow me to draw all that may
be due the Consulate until such
time as I may return to my post,
for this Mr. Judson has already received
an equivalent. The rules contained
in



in above mentioned instructions to 
Consular Officers on leave, have, today,
for the first time come under my
notice. Therefore, having no knowledge 
of any rule which made it necessary to have
a written agreement, to be furnished in
duplicate. I have failed unfortunately, to
provide one and am force to ask the Department 
to accept my statement as a fact.

I, having received no intimation
from the Department, that it had acted
favorably on my recommendation of
Mr. Baines as Vice Consul, although his
Bond was forwarded at the same time
as my despatch recommending his appointment.
I thought it advisable to not
leave Mr Baines in charge, and await
an expression from the Department
relative to his appointment as permanent 
Vice Consul.

I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Henry F. Downing,
U.S. Consul
