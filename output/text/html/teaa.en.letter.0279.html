Subject:

Emancipation of Slaves.

Abstract of Contents.



1d Assistant Secretary. Mar 18 1889

Ans Pratt inquiry and say:

The record of this country
in regard to the emancipation
of human beings from slavery
is conspicuous and consistent.
Having effected the manumission 
ourselves during the civil war
of nearly four millions of slaves,
our moral sympathies have 
been with the other nations 
which like Spain and 
Brazil, have followed our
example in  away the
last traces of human bondage on
the American Continent.

While our policy has 
ever been to avoid direct
entanglement in the domestic
concerns of distant states,
and we may not thus take
active part in the reported
movement, Mr Pratt should
lose no fitting opportunity to 
testify the interest with which
the United States will view the
efforts of Zanzibar to  herself
with the other nations of the
earth in their almost universal
condemnation and abhorrence of
slavery, and will express our hope
that in the natural progress of
the emancipation of all slaves in the
dominion of H. M. the Sultan

Sir:

I have the honor to advise
the Department that matters
remain quiet in Zanzibar
and its vicinity.

It is my belief however
that a move is being 
contemplated looking to the
emancipation of all the
slaves in the Island of
Zanzibar. The
Government of Great Britain
is the leading spirit in
this movement, but they will
naturally expect the co-operation 
of the other nations,
without which: they would
very likely be accomplish
but . 
I



I should be glad to be 
informed by the Department as
to what position ought to be
assumed by the United States
representatives in such an
event.

The Sultan, whatever his
private sentiments might be,
would protest vigorously
against any such movement:
since the large Arab population
would never submit
peacefully to such emancipation 
of their slaves and
would withdraw their support
from the Sultan unless he
defended their position.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
Seth A Pratt
U.S. Consul
