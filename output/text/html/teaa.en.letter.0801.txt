Sir

I have the honor to
inform the Department that
the work of construction of the
Railway from Loanda to Ambaca,
and styled the Royal Trans-African 
Railway, was inaugurated
on the 31st ultimo by the Governor 
General of the Province, assisted
by the Bishop of Angola and
Congo, and the principal officials
of the Province.

The first sod was cut and
the first stone laid on the site
intended for the construction
of the principal station, by
the Governor General, and a 
religious ceremony calling for
divine blessing on the work 
was

The Assistant Secretary of State

was performed by the Bishop.

The works are commenced
and large numbers of natives
and others employed; and it is
expected the line will be ready
for traffic within the time
mentioned in the contract,
viz: four years.

A vessel with a cargo of
material for constructions is
expected every day from the
states, and most likely as the
work progresses other products
of the United States will be in
requisition.

I have the honor to be,
Sir
Your most obedient servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul.
