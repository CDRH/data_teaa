Department of State Received Aug 2 1883

United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda, 16th June, 1883

Sir

I have the honor to inform the Department 
of the loss of the Barque "Merlin"
of New Bedford, owned by Messrs Tucker &amp; Co
&amp; others of that city, on the 22nd May
south of Port Alexander in Lat: 16 4'
From a statement of the Captain and crew
original of which I enclose, it appears
that she went aground in a dense fog
and owing to a heavy surf at the time
they could not save her, although they
did all in their power.

The Captain also states that on the voyage 
up, on trying his Chronometers, he found
them out about 30 miles; and he loses
everything, as he was part owner and 
was not insured. They left the vessel on
the 23rd taking what they could of
provisions and clothes, and proceeded 
north to Mossamedes, where they arrived
on the 24th May, and were taken charge
of



of, by the Portuguese authorities who
treated them most kindly, and the 
Governor charted a small vessel
to bring them here, where they arrived
on the 3rd of this month.

The Governor promised to send and
look after the vessel, and save anything 
that could possibly be saved,
and pay the expenses incurred, out
of the proceeds, any surplus, to be 
forwarded to the Consulate. Should 
however nothing be saved, the A/C
will be forwarded for payment by
first steamer

When the men arrived here, I had some
difficulty in arranging quarters for
such a large number, however I hired
a house out of town for part, and got
the officers divided into one or two places,
and the whole expense will not exceed
a dollar a head

By this steamer the "Portugal" bound
to Lisbon to day I send
6 of the men to St Thiago where they
belong, 13 to Madeira, as they belong



to St. Helena, and it is the nearest 
port where there is any communication
with that Island, and
7 to Lisbon, who wish to go to America
and where there is more likelihood of
their getting a vessel.

Sometimes we have communication with
St Helena, but as there is no likelihood 
of any just now, I thought it best to 
send them by this steamer, as stopping
here on chance, would only add to the 
expense. I have arranged with the Agents
of the Mail steamers, Messrs Garrido Camara &amp; Co. 
to allow one third off the usual passage
money, which makes the passages as 
follows:



13 men for Madeira @ 40$ =
Rs 520$000



less 1/3
173$000




Rs 347$000
= $377.17 cts


6 " " St Thiago @ 35$ =
Rs 210$000



less 1/3
70$000




Rs 140$000 =
$152.17 cts


7 " " Lisbon @ 45$ =
Rs 315$000



less 1/3
105$000




Rs 210$000 =
$228.26 cts



Total
$757.60 cts





For these amounts, I have passed Bills on
the Secretary of State at 15 days sight
in favor of Messrs Garrido Camara &amp; Co. each
one separately, so as to make it clear to 
the Captain who is a foreigner I have
also instructed him that he is to have
the Bills endorsed by the Consul where
the men are landed, otherwise they will 
not be paid by the Department.

I have also passed a draft for $338.00 cts 
in favor of Mr Fredk A. Silva of Boston
to pay the board and lodging A/C rendered,
voucher No 1 enclosed.

Enclosed I also send certificate of Consul
Du Verge's absence form this City, in
accordance with Consular instructions.

I have the honor 
to be
Your Obedient Servant

seamen, declare on our solemn oath
that the following statement is a 
true and correct account of the



loss of the above vessel on which we
were employed at the time of her
loss. We declare that the Bark
"Merlin" of New Bedford of 246 Tons
went on shore at 1/2 past 12 o'clock
at night on the 22nd of May south of
Port Alexander in Lat: 16 4' it being a 
very thick fog at the time and the
land could not be seen at three ships
lengths from the shore. She struck 
twice and then, careened, the
wind at the time being a fresh break
from the SW. After striking got a
Kedge anchor out and hove it right
but this would not start her
and still continued to thump and
strike on the sand there being at
the time a heavy surf, the sea
breaking over the ship at times:
took one of the anchors on a raft
out to windward hove right 
but could not start her but before
this her pumps were chocked
with sand and the water over
the ground tier of casks and pieces



of plank and keel were flooding up
but we still continued to work hard
after all our hopes were over.

At 6 a.m. seven feet of water forward
and 8 feet aft she having settled 
four feet in the sand By getting
a large anchor and on the quarter
she had worked head on to the 
shore and at low tide was about
three ships lengths distant.

It was impossible to land at this
point in a boat there being a very
heavy surf on Concluded to leave
as soon as possible as we had done
everything possible to save her for
if she were to break up during the
night it would have been dangerous
to have got clear of her with the
boats. We took what we could of
personal effects and provisions and
left her at 2 p.m. on the 23rd May 
for Little Fish Bay about 60 miles
distant. The vessel when we left 
her had settled 6 feet in the sand.
We arrived at Little Fish Bay on the



24th May at 2 p.m. After arriving 
at Mossamedes (Little Fish Bay)
the Governor told us he would
procure us a vessel to carry us
to Loanda where there was a 
Consul. Left Little Fish Bay on
the 30th May and arrived at Loanda
on June 3rd in the Cabique 
chartered by the Governor.

If anything can be saved by the 
Government it is to go towards
the expenses incurred at Little
Fish Bay and any surplus forwarded 
to the Consul, should
however nothing be saved the
account of expenses will be
forwarded to Government.

The Governor and people at
Mossamedes treated us in the
kindest way possible and did
all they could to assist us, and 
make us comfortable until a 
vessel could be had to bring
us to Loanda.

At the time of the loss we calculated



we had on board about
110 Brls. oil as as far as we know
the vessel is not insured, at least
the part owned by Captain Allen
