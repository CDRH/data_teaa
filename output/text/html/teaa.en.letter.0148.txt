Augt. 7th 1882.

To
Honorable J. C. Bancroft Davis
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.



Sir

I have the honor to state that Mr. Henry 
M. Stanley arrived here on board the Belgian
Steamer "Heron" from Banana, very ill on
the 25th of July, and has resided since at
the Netherland and German Consulate.
He will leave by the Portuguese Mail steamer
for Madeira, and perhaps Europe.
His sickness has prevented me so far 
obtaining from him any information that 
may be of value to the State Dept.

I have also the honor to report that the 
loss of the British African Mail S.S.
"Ethiopia" Capt Simonds, which struck
on the Indian Rocks off Indian point
Latt. 4" 32' South, and 11" 45' long East
on the 29th of July 1882 7 a.m.
The steamer was abandoned by force



to the natives by her Capt. officers and crew
comprising 79. souls.

The steamer and cargo are a total loss 
but am told that both are well insured
she had on board 2 packages addressed 
to this consulate which are lost; and
having not received any news from the
U.S. last month I am afraid that it
might have been some blank forms or
others sent to me by the State Dept.
The Indian point, and shoal which run in
a W.S.W. direction to a distance of 1 3/4
miles has at its furthermost end many
sharp pointed rocks on which the 
"Ethiopia" was wrecked: The loss
of said Steamer happening in day 
time, calm weather and smooth sea
cannot but be attributed to gross 
carelessness, and rather too much
trust in the part of the master to 
some African white traders of Loango
a Trading settlement 3 miles off Indian
Point passengers with him and 
representing themselves as thoroughly
acquainted with the coast and



particularly the Indian Point and shore.
The crew now here under the British
Consul's care are far from behaving
themselves and are daily and nightly
seen drunk, and as Bilious or green
fever and Dysentry are raging at
present among Europeans the half
of them may soon be in the hospital

I have the honor to be 
Sir
Your obedient servant
L de R. du Verge
US Consul.
