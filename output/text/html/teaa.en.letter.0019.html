United States Commercial Agency
Loanda April 5, 1861.

Sir,

I last had the honor of addressing
the State Department under date of January 22nd
enclosing Returns from this Commercial Agency
for the Quarter ending Dec 31st 1860, also giving
some information in respect to the "disposition made
by the British Government of the Africans captured
from slavers by the British Navy" &amp; also as to the
"disposition made by that Government of the officers
&amp; Crews of those Slavers", which I trust has ere
this been received.

I have now to inform your Honor that
there is a prospect of a very serious affair occurring
between this Government of Angola &amp; that of
the United States, owing to the imprisonment of
Mr E A Birnie, Naval Store Keeper for the US 
Squadron on this Coast. The facts as near 
as I can accertain from Mr Birnie, his Brother,
&amp; two Cabindas who were in the store house at the 
time are, that on the 9th March a Portuguese
named Oliveira who had sold Mr Birnie some
wood, went into Mr B house to get the payment
of

To the
Hon. Secretary of State
Washington D.C.



of his account. Mr B told him he would 
pay if Oliveira would deduct the price of 100
Sticks (value $1.25Â¢) which he had not received.
Oliveira said he could not deduct anything as he
thought he had delivered the number, according to
his bill. Birnie told him he would not pay
unless Oliveira made the deduction. Oliveira 
being ready to leave for Mossamedes in the Steamer
then about to start &amp; not wishing to go before settling
the Bill began talking very loud &amp; calling
Birnie harsh names. Birnie then told him to
leave the office which he refused to do 'till he
received his money. Birnie sent for the Police,
but they could not come without an order from
the Chief, who was not then to be found. Oliveira
continued his insulting remarks, when Birnie took
hold of him to put him out, when Oliveira struck
Birnie with his Cane &amp; Birnie returned the blow.
several blows passed between them &amp; Oliveira was
considerably hurt in his head &amp; had his arm broke.
Oliveira went to the Judge &amp; entered his complaint
against Birnie &amp; his Brother William (who says he
did not strike Oliveira, but only helped his Brother
Edward put Oliveira out of the room) Although
the complaint was made on the 9th March, the warrant
for the arrest of E A &amp; Wm Bernie was not
served



served till the 25th. on which day Mr Birnie 
went to the Judge in company with myself
in order to get Bail. After an examination
(part of which was forced &amp; without the aid
or liberty of obtaining Counsel) Mr B was
ordered to be taken to prison, which although
may do to keep Portuguese, is not fit for Americans
in the situation of Mr Birnie, in this country.
Mr B, having been in the habit of corresponding
with flag officer Inman, wrote him that he
had been ordered to prison &amp; requesting advice.
The flag officer requested me to obtain Counsel
for Mr B. which I did, but as yet the Counsel
has not been able to get Mr B. out on bail, although
the Doctor has pronounced Oliveira in no
danger of his life. Several Communications
have passed between the Governor &amp; flag officer,
&amp; I now understand flag officer Inman had
demanded the release of Mr Birnie by 12 M 
this day.

There is considerable excitement on
board the "Constellation," "Portsmouth," "Mystic"
&amp; Sumpter" which vessels are now lying in
this harbor. The "San Jacinto" left this on
the 3rd inst to meet the "Mohican" which latter
vessel has the Mails from the States via
England



England up to February 10th. The "San J"
will probably return here by the 10th inst.

Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt
John G. Willis
US Com. Agenct

2 PM.

I now learn what I have stated 
in respect to Mr Birnie being released at 12 M
this day is without foundation, &amp; that the "flag
ship" goes to sea tomorrow.
