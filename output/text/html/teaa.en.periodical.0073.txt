A Missionary





When Rev. Dr. William H. Sheppard, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, returned
to America a few years ago, after spending twenty years as a missionary for the Southern
Presbyterian Church in the Belgian Congo, many of his friend felt sure that African
labors and hardships had incapacitated him from further service.

The story of Dr. Sheppard's brave and successful attacks on the chartered Belgian
rubber companies that had committed unspeakable atrocities among the helpless Africans
is a matter of historical record. That Dr. Sheppard has "come back" physically is
a genuine gain from the South. Today Dr. Sheppard is doing in Louisville, Kentucky,
some notably constructive social uplift work for his people. He is working in sympathetic
co-operation with Rev. John Little and other southern white men and women.

William H. Sheppard was born in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 1865. He found his way to
Hampton in the early eighties and there received the inspiration to devote his life
to the service of his fellowmen. Then followed hard years in carrying the gospel and
ideas of education to the natives of Central Africa. Whether facing hostile cannibal
chiefs or unscrupulous officials dominated by the will of King Leopold, Dr. Sheppard
has displayed courage, patience and faith.
