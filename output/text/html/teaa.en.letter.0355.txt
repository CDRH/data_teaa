No. 6.

United States Consulate
Zanzibar September 8th 1890

To the Honorable
W. F. Wharton
Assist Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

On investigating the
present commercial and
political situation here
I find that American
Interests are likely to be
affected by the following:

No. 1. The English Protectorate 
is soon to be
proclaimed and enforced,
Now will this affect the
American judicial and
extra-territorial rights,
treaties, exequatuer, direct
communication with the
Sultan etc?

No. 2. The Sultan and
Germany are treating for
the cession



the cession to Germany
for a lump sum of the
African Coast at present
leased to the German
East African Company.
If this Coast becomes a
separate state, will free
trade be allowed with 
Zanzibar? About two
thirds of the present
American trade is conducted 
indirectly with and
through the above district,
if any additional tariff
is put on trade between
the island of Zanzibar
and the mainland, our
merchants must establish
new agencies in the
German territory and give
up their extensive houses
in Zanzibar, or retire from
trade entirely. For obvious
reasons such a course as the former
would be extremely
expensive



expensive and 
and in  of 
experience on the Brava
Coast will not be 
American Interests 
that but one duty shall
be levied both on exports
and imports to and from
the island of Zanzibar
and the mainland.

No. 3. The Brava Coast of
Zanzibar has been leased
to the British East African
Company who have not
occupied it but are now
talking of transferring it
to an Italian Company.
The American house of
Roper,  &amp; Co. have
a large trade and much
property there, but believing
that no Europeans can
successfully administer
this Coast government
they have decided to
withdraw



withdraw, temporarily
at mayotte.

I respectfully request
such instructions and
information regarding
the foregoing as the
Department may see
fit to forward and
particularly relating
to No. 1.

There are no other
matters of importance
in this Consular district
of which the Department
has not been previously
advised.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant
E. D. Roper Jr.
U.S. Consul
