No. 26.

United States Consulate,
St. Paul de Loanda,
January 31, 1888.

Hon G. L. Rives.
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
the Department that my residence in
Loanda, 'tho short, has shown me that
it is impossible under present arrangement
for me to live upon the salary allowed
by the present laws. The frequent attention
of a physician and in many directions 
a departure from that strict economy
which might bring expenses within that
amount allowed is the effect of an
African climate. When to this is added
the expense of providing for a family
in the U.S., it will be seen that by
assuming this position at an early
date. I am not only just to myself
but am acting towards my government
with



with frankness and with dependence
upon its justice.

The importance of this Consulate
is such as is derived from the cultivation
of African trade. Cape Coast Castle, daily
growing in importance, Lagos; Benny, at the
mouth of the Niger with many other points,
are valuable; but Monrovia, Gabon and
this place are politically and commercially 
the important points on this coast.

Those districts, which are
watered by the Congo and its affluents,
since the establishment of the "Congo Free
State" by Mr Stanley, under the protection
of the Belgian Government, have gained
a value in the age of the commercial
world second to no other part of the
coast. The effect of this has naturally
given to Loanda, because of its geographical 
position an impetus expressing
itself in many directions: for instance,
railroads, water works &amp;c.

Given these facts, it will be
conceded that, as a factor to advance
our foreign trade it is necessary that
it



it should be cultivated in this direction.
While as a means towards this end a
Consulate here is of significance, the 
first consideration should be the Consul.

When the interests of our country
are placed in the hands of a trader, they
must suffer, more particularly in a district
such as this, where his whole duty is such
as relate to the advance of our foreign
trade.

A trading Consul not only is
at times prejudiced in judgement and
dependent in action, but he also often
finds occasion to make the performance
of public duty give way to private interests.

Induced by these opinions I 
have desired to keep myself in that 
position which would cause me to think
it my first and only duty, and enable me,
through influence and independence to
protect and advance the interests of
American trade and to protect American
citizens in their property, but I have
failed, and I find that unless
some



some way is found for supplementing my
income. I cannot remain here.

This being the case I would
respectfully ask from the Department
its favorable decision in its consideration
of either of the following requests: Viz,

1ยบ A recommendation to his Excellency the
President for my transfer to Liberia
as Consul General (see papers on file
in Dep't.),

2ยบ Leave to visit the United States for
the purpose of forming such business
connections as will permit me to
remain in charge of this Consulate

3ยบ Leave to return to the United 
State for the purpose of tendering
my resignation.

I regret that necessity
forces me into this position but I have
no option. It is better for me to "grasp
my nettle," than it is to seen the
risk of discrediting my government
as I am sorry to say, has here
and before by United States
Consuls here laboring under the same



same or like disadvantages.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant
Henry F. Downing
U.S. Consul
