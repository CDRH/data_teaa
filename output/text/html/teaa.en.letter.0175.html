Hon Wm. H. Seward,
Sec. of State.

Respected Sir:

Permit
the undersigned to inquire,
whether there would be any
breach of propriety, in 
bringing to your notice
the commercial wants, and
defects of the existing
intercourse, between this
country and the infant
Republic of Liberia; and
whether consistent with
the rules regulating diplomatic 
intercourse. I
may not, in person, as 
the bearer of a Commission
from the Government of
Liberia, empowering me
as "Special Commissioner,"
preparatory to opening
the way for the recognition
of my country, and the 
formation of a Commercial
Treaty therewith, couched
in the language and words



following, to wit:

"Therefore, I, Stephen 
Allen Benson, President
as aforesaid have ordained,
constituted, and appointed,
and by these presents, do
hereby ordain, constitute,
and appoint him, the 
said John D. Johnson
Esquire, Special Commissioner 
on behalf of
the Republic of Liberia
aforesaid to open a 
communication with the 
Government of the United
States, and to otherwise
afford the necessary information, 
preparatory
to securing the contemplated
objects as aforesaid.

And further, I, 
Stephen Allen Benson
President as aforesaid
do hereby further authorize
and empower the said 
John D. Johnson, Esquire,
to appoint one or more
persons, citizens of



of the United States, as
Commissioners to be
associated with himself 
for the furtherance of
the objects herein
contemplated;" may not
bring to your notice
those wants and give
such information as
may enable you to
meet the demands in
the case.

I am in this city 
for the above purposes
and as empowered, I
have requested my 
friend, Rev. James Mitchell
to aid me in these
negotiations; I therefore
wait your pleasure,
and will be pleased at
your call to present my
credentials in the premises.

I remain, with sentiments
of Respect your
humble servt. &amp;c.
John D. Johnson,
Special Commissioner of
the Republic of Liberia
