Legation of Liberia
Yonkers, N.Y. May 11, 1870

Sir

I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your note of the 19th ult, enclosing
a communication from the Secretary of 
the Navy, stating that a copy of my letter,
in reference to the apprehension of an attack
of the natives on the settlements of Liberia,
will be forwarded to Rear Admiral Radford 
commanding the European fleet, for 
which, please receive thanks.

The telegram, that Liberia
was engaged in war with the natives proves
untrue, letters dated there later, make

Honble Hamilton Fish
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.



no mention of it. On the contrary, a 
letter from President Roye states,
that they are about extending a road
into the interior for commerce &amp;c.

I regret the trouble occasioned 
by this false report.

I have the honor to be
with the highest consideration
Sir
Your obedient servant
H. M. Schieffelin
