retail by the piece to the better class of natives.

A considerable quantity is also used up 
country in the Barter Trade for Coffee
and Rubber although the following are the 
staple goods used in the Barter Trade.

In 1877 several pieces of goods of very
good quality were brought in American
Vessels as samples but they were unsaleable 
on account of the sizes being different.

The Cloth was good and if it had been 
put up in proper sizes would have sold well.

All these should be well starched or sized
much more so than the finer goods as they
are all for the Barter Trade. There is great
competition in this trade, so often they come
a yard or so shorter, and an inch or so
narrow, but all doubled to imitate goods of
18 yards which used to be the regulation
length

Great attention should be paid to the 
regularity of the pieces in each Bale, and to 
the packing.

Many qualities of Handkerchiefs also
are in use, ranging from 12 to 15 Handkerchiefs
per price. However I do not send sample of 
these as the quality is so varied, and nearly
all styles and qualities pass.

The duty on the above mentioned Cotton
Goods is as follows:

85 Rs = 90 cts per Killo are Sample No 1
230 Rs = 25 "  "  "  "  "  Nos 2/13
and 4% more on the value here, which is
usually calculated at about 30% over the 
Invoice



Invoice price.

When these goods come via Lisbon or from
Lisbon in a Portuguese vessel they pay 70% of the 
beforementioned duties. Manufactured in 
Portugal and bringing a Certificate to that effect
they pay only 20% of the beforementioned duty.

Should they come in Foreign Vessels from 
any other Country they pay the full amount
of duty as previously stated.

Shortly a new Tariff is to be brought
into force which will increase the duty on
Cotton goods considerably.

As soon as I can obtain a copy I will
send it to the Department with a translation.

Nearly all cotton goods come from Liverpool 
and London in steamer to Lisbon and thence
in the Portuguese steamers. At Lisbon they 
pay a small duty which allows them to pass 
here paying only 70% of the duty.

The expenses via Lisbon from England 
including carriage from Manchester to Liverpool
Entry &amp; Cartage, freight &amp;  by Steamers
to Lisbon, &amp; afterwards to this port.

Duty in Lisbon without commission is
about 14% to 15%.

All



All these goods are used in the
Province of Angola, but at Ambriz and the 
North the sizes vary, and the trade is different.

My information is taken from different
Invoices received from by Mercantile Houses
established here.

The Portuguese Steamers leave Lisbon 
on the 5th of every month for this port
touching at the other Portuguese Colonies.

There are also two lines of Steamers
from Liverpool, but it does not suit to ship
Cotton Goods by these on account of the extra
30% duty the Consignees would have to pay.

Nearly all goods that come here are 
in execution of orders on account and
risk of the Merchants here.

Consignments are not large although
a well assorted establishment might do a 
good trade, as often the traders run short
of different qualities in their assortments.

The usual Commissions are 5% for 
selling and 2% for remitting in Bills and 
4% for remitting in produce. Some Houses
however do the whole business for 5%
commission without guarantee &amp; 8%
with



with guarantee.

It is difficult to give the number of
pieces used during a year as no statistical 
statement of same is kept in the Custom
House.

However I know of Houses here that 
use from 40 to 50,000 pieces in a year.

The trade is nearly all in the hands
of the Portuguese, and it would be difficult
to get orders from this market.

Lately travellers have been here from
England and Germany to Solicit orders but
have done little or nothing.

The Exchange is Rs 4500 per £1
sterling, or 920 Reis per Dollar.

I have the honor to be,
Your most obedient servant,

Assistant Secretary of State
