Sir

We have the honour to 
acknowledge the receipt of the Exchange 
copy of the Treaty of peace,
of friendship and commerce between
the Government of the United States
and Madagascar, ratified by His 
Excellency the President, and forwarded 
by you on the 23rd instant.

As we are leaving New 
York for Liverpool on Saturday the 
31st of March, we take this opportunity 
of repeating the assurances
of our gratitude for, and high appreciation 
of the hearty and cordial 
reception we have everywhere
met with during our visit to your 
country.

We trust and hope that
our

The Honorable 
F. T. Frelinghuysen
Principal Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.



our visit has been the means 
of bringing to the notice of the 
American people a large field for 
American commercial enterprise.
We can assure you that the good 
report we shall carry back to Madagascar 
will cause our people to 
hail with pleasure the prospect of a 
more extensive trade with the United 
States, especially knowing that
your commerce abroad has no aggressive 
ends in view, but only closer
and more frequent communications 
for the benefit of both countries,
which will tend nevertheless to hasten 
the civilization of our island
as a free and independent country.

We feel confident that
the treaty now concluded will bring 
about these results, and that the 
relations between our two Governments
will continue to be most friendly.

We offer the assurances of 
our highest consideration and remain
Your obedient servants
