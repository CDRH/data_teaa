Hon William H Seward
Secretary of State

Sir,

I have the 
honor to acknowledge the reception 
of your Dispatch, No. 1, informing 
me that the President, had appointed 
me Commercial Agent 
of the United States, at St Paul 
de Loanda.

The Consular Bond, 
I forward by this opportunity to 
Boston, Mass; from whence it will
be forwarded to the Department 
of State, fully executed.

I enclose the Oath 
of Allegiance sworn to before 
John G Willis Esq, the Acting 
Commercial Agent.

I was born in Brazil, 
of American parentage, in 1830, 
and arrived in the State of 
Massachusetts



Massachusetts at the age of 
three years, where I have resided
ever since, excepting the time
my business has called me to
this coast. My naturalization
papers bear date of Salem Mass. 
November 5th 1851.

I was appointed 
from the State of Massachusetts.
I never was in Portugal, but 
I have resided in this Province 
of Angola since 1852.

A previous engagement 
forces me to visit England in 
a few weeks, my stay there 
will be short. I hope to return 
as soon or soon after the arrival 
here of my Passport and
Certificate of Appointment with
the necessary Exequatur.

The order from the
Department for John G Willis Esq.
to deliver over to me the Commercial
Agency, was also received
and will be presented
on



on the arrival here of the Certificate 
of Appointment, when I shall 
assume the duties of my office

Thanking the 
Department for the confidence
they have placed in me, I hope 
my long residence here, familiarity
of the language and people,
will enable me to give satisfaction.

I have the honor
to be
Your Most Obd't Servant:
Augustus Archer Silva
