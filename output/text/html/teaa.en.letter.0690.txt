Department of State Received Jan 2 1885

United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
November 3rd 1884.

Sir

I have the honor to draw the attention of
the Department to my despatch dated May 
13th 1884 to which I have as yet received no 
answer.

I have again a request from the
merchant at Mossamedes Mr Manoel Jos√©
Alves Bastos, owner of the Cahique that brought
the shipwrecked crew of the vessel "Merlin"
from Mossamedes to this port in 1883 for
payment of the freight viz: 300$000 equal
to $326 00/100 and I beg to request that the
Government will authorize me to pay him
at once as Mr Bastos has been always
exceedingly kind and of great service to all
American Sailors that have come to his port.

Unless



Unless this is attended to at once I am
afraid that any future American sailors that
may arrive at Mossamedes in distress, will
have great difficulty in obtaining assistance

I have the honor to be
Your most obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
US. Vice Consul.

Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
