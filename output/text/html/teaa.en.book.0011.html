Incidents of the "Rubber Wars," Told by Congo Children.

[ . . . ]

Take but one moment the point of view of the hunted native, whose lands, labor, and
all whose fortunes, present and future, have been made an object of a heartless traffic,
— and all the flimsy scenery in which the industrious Bureaucrats have sought to stage
the story of Leopold's enterprise in Africa, all the tinsel with which they have sought
to plaster over and decorate the sad havoc he has wrought there, falls away, and one
sees the thing for what it is — not civilization nor progress, but ruthless, irreverent
and alien meddling in the affairs and fortunes of helpless peoples, accompanied by
hideous butcheries, all in the interests of a clique of mercantile free-booters.

This so-called civilization in the Congo has the curse of Midas on it. As its touch
everything, the most vile and the most holy, the feasts of cannibals, and the pious
prayers of saints, smoking villages, and the pale juice of the rubber vine, the lusts
of savages and the wails of little children; everything has been somehow and somewhere
minted into gold, and has gone to swell the returns of the Antwerp rubber market.
