Jose Galdino Carvalho da Silva. Commander
of the Order of Christ and Member of the Medical
Faculty of the Hospital of Saint
Joseph.

I hereby certify that Augustus Archer
Silva Esquire has been treated by me for
rheumatism and also for Hepatitis, and 
that these diseases not yielding readily
to treatment, I advised him to remain
a longer time in Europe, as in this way
his ailments might be overcome, and only
in the last few days have they showed
signs of improvement. This being the
truth I am ready to swear to it on the 
Holy Bible.

Lisbon 15th of February 1871.
signed Jos√© Galdino da Silva.
