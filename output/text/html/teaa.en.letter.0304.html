Received Dec 25 1866

F. W. Seward Esqr
Assistant Secretary of State Washington D.C.

Sir

Your
communication of the 21st ult in reply to mine of
the 14th has been received.

I am requested
to inform the Department why my account for
rent of Office was not presented quarterly

I wrote to the 
Department while in Africa in regard the rent of 
the Office and received for answer that if I would procure
and forward to the Department a certificate signed 
by two respectable merchants to the effect that  
built an office and used said Office expressly for 
Governement purposes one for no other. That upon 
receipt of such a certificate the Department would 
inform me of its decision. I immediately forwarded 
Gordon &amp; Bremmer certifying to the above facts also 
certifying that in their judgment the rent of said 
Office was worth one hundred and fifty dollars 
per annum. I never received any reply to the
certificate. I delayed writing again in regard to this 
matter not wishing to call attention again to the subject which
I supposed was already under consideration.

I disliked too to press the claim after once fairly presenting 
it at a time when it seemed to me you must 
have so much of greater importance to occupy your 
attention. Another diffi reason too was the difficulty 
experienced in that far off out of the way country in 
getting drafts cashed without paying such extreme
rates of exchange &amp; then perhaps not at all.

The above are the plainly stated reasons 



why I did not present quartly accounts &amp; collect next 
quartly for my Office. I am quite sure I want nothing
but what is just and honorable in the matter.

Your 
Communication states that my account cannot be
allowed until proper vouchers are furnished the
Department. The voucher before refered to as 
having been signed by Messrs Gordon &amp; Bremmer I think 
must have been received by the Department if so please
inform me what other vouchers are necessary. If said
voucher was not received please inform me; and I 
would most respectfully request your indulgence
in this matter as I have no dates of communications
written while in Africa

I am Sir with the highest 
consideration your most humble 
&amp; obedent servant 
Henry May
