US Consulate Goree-Dakar
January 4th 1886

To the Honorable
James D Porter
Assistant Secretary of State

Sir

Enclosed please find
Returns &amp; Accounts from
this Consulate for the December
Quarter of 1886, which an examination
I trust will be found correct.

The statistics given in Form
(129) are for the year 1884, but for
the purpose of estimating on the
Commerce of this Consular district
will answer fairly well for
late seasons.

The discrepancy between the
amount of the imports and the
amount of the exports may be
accounted for largely by the fact 
that exports are undervalued
in clearing, and large funds
find their way to Europe which



are not counted.

Perhaps I should here caption
that Government Officers have been
averse to given information, probably
because they are discouraged from doing
so by their superiors. I am now
situated however so I can give
statistical information much
easier than heretofore, and
hope ere long to furnish the
Department with most of the
main facts regarding the Commerce
and other industries of the
Colony. I am Sir
Very Respectfully Yours
Peter Strickland
US Consul
