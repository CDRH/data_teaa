St. Paul de Loanda January 1st 1865

Sir

Agreeably to my Despatch
No 1 and 2 wherein I informed
Your Excellency of my intended
departure for England, I am
now about to carry it into effect
I shall take passage on the
Dutch Mail Steamer "Earlde Grey"
for Lisbon in a few days from
whence I shall proceed to England.
My detention in England
will be about thirty
or forty days when I shall
return to my post of duty.

As heretofore advised
this involuntary absence 
from

Hon Wm H Seward
Secretary of State
Washington



from my post of duty was an
engagement of a commercial nature
entered into before I was aware
of my appointment as Commercial
Agent, on which my commercial
prosperity depends. I would therefore
request that indulgence of the
Department to my case as one
of exception to Circular No 46 on
file in this Agency.

As also advised I
have appointed this date Mr
Frederick A Silva a native citizen
of the United States to represent
this office as Acting Commercial
Agent during my absence, which
appointment has been recognize
by His Excellency the Governor
General



General. In accordance with
Consular Regulations I enclose
Oath of Allegiance (Form 131) Inventory
of Agency and Form No 134.

Trusting these proceedings
on my part will be satisfactory
to the Department.

I have the honor
to be
You most Obd't Serv't
