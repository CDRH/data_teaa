Sir

Circumstances having
caused me to leave Loanda previous to giving you notice thereof, I
avail myself of the first opportunity since my arrival to inform
you that I have left the office of Commercial Agent in charge
of my Partner in Business at that place Mr Aug. A. Silva.

I am now about closing an engagement to return &amp; when
completed intend visiting Washington with some Introductory
Letters relating to my appointment as Consul at Loanda instead
of Coml Agent.

Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt
John G. Willis
