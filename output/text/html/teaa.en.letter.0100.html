The Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.:

Sir; I have the honor to report the
arrival here on the 19th inst. of Lieut.
Cameron, leader of the East Coast
Livingstone Expedition, who has successfully
crossed the African Continent
from Zanzibar. He reached the West
Coast on the 7th inst arriving at Benguella.
He is accompanied by 57 
natives of Zanzibar, all that are left
of over 300 with whom he originally
commenced the journey. I understand
that the Expedition has been a complete
success, and that he has made some



most important Geographical discoveries.
I believe that he is in course
of treaty for the purchase of a vessel
to transport his followers to their native
country; and as soon as possible after
their departure he, himself will proceed
to Europe

I am, Sir
Your obedient Servant
Robt S Newton
