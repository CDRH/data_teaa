Department of State Received Jun 25, 1888

United States Consulate
Saint Paul de Loanda
May 16th, 1888

Sir

I have the honor to inform the department
that Mr. Henry F Downing late U.S. Consul
at this place sailed for America on the
Portuguese mail steamer of March 15 on
thereabout and that I was appointed by
him to act as Vice Consul, my appointment 
dating from March 31st as will be 
seen by enclosed copy of letter to the
governor general of the Province of Angola
(Enclosure No 1)

The above mentioned enclosure 
was duly presented to the governor 
and received the proper official
recognition from him, and I assumed
the duties on the same date mentioned
in said copy of enclosure.

Mr. Downing carried the official
stamp and seal of the Consulate to
Cabinda the place where I was then
residing and delivered them to one
on the 18th day of March, but I could not
enter upon my duties before the day
specified in my letter of appointment.
Mr.



Mr. Downing requested me to execute
a bond in the sum of $2000.00 (two
thousand dollars) which bond he returned
to me from St. Thom√© with enclosed letter,
(Enclosure No. 2) upon finding it improperly
made out.

The general behavior Mr.
Downing during his short stay here was neither
commendable to himself nor creditable to
the government of the U.S. I am also
very sorry to say that his conduct here as
U.S. Consul was left if anything but
long and pleasant for his successors

1st.

He took all kinds of advantages of the 
confidence not to say ignorance of the Portuguese
here, such for instance, as paying his bills
with bogus drafts headed "U.S. Consulate"
which gave his victims the impression that
what said drafts possessed national value
with our government. Some of two drafts
or one of them at least has given for more
than $700.(seven hundred dollars)

Upon my arrival at Loanda I
found



found:

That Mr. Downings creditors had signed
everything belonging to the Consulate.

I at once complained to the governor
generate who informed me that he would
take no action in the matter as Mr. Downings
victims had been led to believe the U.S.
government was responsible for Mr. Downings
debts.

The governor general advised me to
pay off the endebtedness, recover the Archives
and other effects, and report the entire 
affairs in detail to my government.

This I could not do and I had not
enough money, but I concluded to recover
the Archives, and leave the flags writing
material and other paraphernalia until
I could get instructions from the department.

It cost me 136 mil reis or $147.68
one hundred forty seven dollars and 68/100) to
recover the Archives, the receipt of which
I forward a certified translation
(Enclosure No. 3) I think that



that

Mr. Downing took away with him
the Consular regulation and most of
the despatches received during his incumbency 
of this office, as they cannot be
found.

Unfortunately I have no forms
nor instructions of any kind by which
to be governed by,, not even precedents, as
the Archives have been loosely kept and
but very few things recorded.

There is no office furniture
belonging to this consulate, not even a
receptacle for the Archives.

I have found it necessary
to draw on the Treasurer for $50.00 in 
favor of Mr. John Hass Lisbon, which
I hope will be allowed, as I cannot
live at this place without money and it required
the greater joint of what I brought here
with me, to recover the archives.

I beg of leave to say
that if there in any irregularity the peculiarity 
of the situation here must
explain it away, as I cannot do things
of this nature properly



properly

Unless I have the necessary
instructions and I would like to say further 
that if the department sees fit to
appoint me here as Vice Consul and
will furnish the proper instruction etc.
I will endeavor to do my duly not
as much promptitude and regularity as
my ability will permit.

I would be glad to have information
as to affairs rent furniture, etc.
as the expense for these things cannot
possibly come out of $1000 per annum
and furnish a man to live here, even
half way respectable.

It is thought here that that the
smallness of the salary is the reason
that the U.S. Consul sent here generally
resort to financial tricking and intrigue
and almost invariably leave in disgrace

Not understanding anything
about making drafts on the department
and having no resource from which to
learn &amp; have placed the above named
drafts to miscellaneous expenses, there
may be no such expenses. I 
beg



beg

that the department will regulate
this properly for me so that there will
be no inconvenience attached to the
matter, because should there be 
as to its immediate payment it will have
an injurious effect upon the next attempt I
may make in disposing of of a draft

The despatches received
since my incumbency more all of
a nature to be acknowledged by Mr.
Downing

Mr. Arthur Edmund Baines
for whom the blank bond was forwarded
to this consulate, has left Loanda

I have the honor to be
Your humble servant
Julius Leroy Judson
Acting U.S. Consul

To the Hon James D. Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
