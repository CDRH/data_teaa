United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda October 19th 1865.

Sir

On the 24th of September, one Edward Baxter 
presented himself to this Commercial Agency and requested 
protection as a destitute American Seaman. He reported 
having deserted from the American Whaling Barque
"Governor Carver" of Westport R.I. at Little Fish 
Bay for the reason that said Barque took in 
slaves at that port.

I called the attention of this 
Provincial Government to the case and requested the 
favor of the Government to send this Seaman to 
Little Fish Bay on board of the Portuguese 
Corvette "Infanto D. Jo√£o" that the Commander
might


Hon William H. Seward 
Secretary of State 
Washington, D.C.




might on the spot investigate the true merits of the 
case that both the honor of Portugal and the United 
States might be properly vindicated. My request was 
complied with and Baxter sailed in said Corvette 
on the 12th inst.

Notwithstanding my apprehension of 
the veracity of this Statement, I took all the 
necessary steps to sift out the truth and by the 
following month's mail, I will forward to the Department 
copies of all correspondence bearing on this 
case; In the meantime the Corvette will return 
better qualifying me to place before you reliable 
information.

I have the honor
To Be
Your most obedt Servant,
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
