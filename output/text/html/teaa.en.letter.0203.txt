Sir

Having been compelled to change air by season
of continued sickness, I made a letter trip up
the Quanza river as far as Dondo which took
me 9 days.

The Quanza river form the South-eastern
boundary of the Portuguese province of Angola
although it is claimed by them to possess
the whole country from Latt. South 5° to 
Latt South 19°: The source of the Quanza is
unknown as yet.

From Dondo to the Bar, is the great
Commercial highway of Angola, but
only navigable for small crafts, The
control of said River by steam navigation
was obtained by the late Mr. Silva the U.S.
commercial agent; and has been kept
ever since under the name of "Quanza 
Steam Navigation" That grant will
expire shortly and leave open, to some
enterprising American a gold field 
of  value.



Trade of all sorts is very brisk at the 
different factories on the right bank of
the river, the left one being still in the
hands of the natives, who will allow no
Europeans to settle there: An exception is
the small fortress and few Catholic church
now almost in ruin of Muxima, held
by the Portuguese; but no trade comes to that place.

Dondo may be called the heart or Capital
of the interior of the Provence of Angola, 
To Dondo, the Portuguese traders and
planters of Cazengo, Golimgo-Alto, Ambaca
Pungo-Andongo, and Malange send
their coffee, wax, Rubber, Ivory &amp;a &amp;a &amp;a
to the shipped to Loanda

It is to Dondo only that the natives
from the right bank of the Quanza bring
their gingula, palm oil, Hides urzella
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c, to be bartered for cloth, Powder, 
arms, Rum, and quincailleries.

The two seasons, are as follows; the winter
begins from June to the middle of October
and summer from middle of October
to the beginning of June.

In winter "also called the dry season"
there is no rain, but heavy dews during
the night, and with the sun generally



obscured by clouds until 9, 10, and 11 a.m.
The Temperature is agreeable, the thermometer
seldom rising above 23°R: in the shade;
The Summer or rainy season, is more properly
divided into two seasons: "The small rain
and the big rain" on the 18th of October when
we have the sun in our , small
showers begin to fall in the afternoon until
the 22d of December when the sun attains
its greatest southern declination; from
that date until the 24th of February, when we
again have the sun in our Zenith, the 
weather remains changeable, while in March
and April the rains come down in
torrents of sometimes twelve and sixteen
hours duration, inundating the country
and swelling the rivers.

The banks in the river as well as the bar
shifts yearly after the rainy season is over
owing to the strong current occasioned
by the heavy rain; During the dray season
a flood tide is felt as far as Bom Jesus
while in the rainy season a current
runs constantly down with a velocity 
of from 4 1/2 knots at Dondo, and
1 1/2 knots at the Bar.

The climate on the banks of the river is 
healthy, fever and liver complaints



being the prevailing diseases especially in the 
rainy months. The Quanza is full of fish,
Aligators and Hypopotomai; When the river has
overflowed its banks and subsides again into
its own bed, the effuria from the ground becoming
very dangerous to European as well as to the
natives 

It is remarkable that the natives suffer as
more from fever then the Europeans, by reason
I believe of their mode of living, which is
entirely on farmiha, and fulia, and poison
themselves with the vile shift called Rum, on trade
Gin; Imported by European traders.

In Cazengo, Pungo-Andongo, Golungo-Alto and
Ambaca, fevers are almost unknown, while the 
climate of "Malenge" is almost European, wheat
growing; and being cultivated now with great 
success.

Two years ago a terrible epidemic of small pox
decimated the nature population, while not a
single European was attacked by it.

In case of sickness a native generally distrusts
European treatment and medicines, but prefers
to be slowly doctored to death by his own countrymen 
and superstitions.

When dead the common negro is buried
anywhere, maybe, a few yards from the door 
of his cubata, or in the middle of the road



Joba, or nature chiefs, are intered with more ceremony.
For three months the corpse is kept above the ground
sitting in a chair, and daily enveloped in new
pieces of cloth, which are robbed during the
night by his former subjects; After this lapse
of time, he is deposited in his grave, two
grown up slaves being decapitated and their
bodies entered with him, as well as a 
boy and a girl "both alive" the former holding
the Joba's pipe and the other a vessel with
water; Although it have never been an eye
witness of this barbarism, and though it
is officially contradicted, I do form by
believe that it is still practised, and
would have gone with my informant to
one of these Burials; if I had been well
and had time to spare.

Another barbarism, not yet abolished
is judgment by fetish: which I have
witnessed more than fifty time on the
West &amp; S. West Coast previous to the present 
Viz: The accused, to show his innocence
deliberately swallows a certain amount
of deadly vegetable poison; if he vomits
it, he is innocent! but if his stomach
retains it, he is guilty of the crime 
imputed to him, and dies.

When a Joba dies, his successor is not



allowed to continue the works which the deceased
may have begun, or to inhabit his residence, nor
does he inherit his fortune, plate or anything
on the contrary, whatever unmovable goods
Houses &amp;a belonging to the deceased, are allowed
to fall into ruin, while all movable goods
are robbed by his subjects immediately after
death. For a whole year the spirit of the 
deceased is supposed to reign; his
successor having no power whatever, the
whole kingdom or tribe remain, therefore,
in a state of anarchy.

The antiquated custom impedes to a great
extent the prosperity of the native tribes,
as whatever one regent may have done
for his people, his successor is obliged to 
annihilate.

Next to Dondo, the most important places
on the Quanza are "Massangano" (fortress, trade and 
cane plantations on the Lucala.) "Boca de 
Guanga" (trade, principaly palm oil fibre and
live stock) "Coffeecaulba" (trade principally 
coffee, palm oil &amp; rock salt.) "Cemga" (trade
principally cotton &amp; fibre) "Bom Jesus" (Large
Cane Plantation distiling abot 11 
of Trade Rum per day) Calumbo (Portuguese
chesado but otherwis unimportant) and 
Tombe as a firewood depository.



The right bank of the Quanza which is extremely
fertile and well cultivated is lined with
native villages where Europeans are forbidden
to enter.

At the Bar of the Quanza on a low sandy
spit of land surrounded by thickly
wooded marshes, the Quanza Company 
has established her depot and steamer
head quarters; having about 20 to 25 white
men from England as Engineers, boilers
maker, Carpenters, &amp;a &amp;a and over 100
blacks the having quite a little village
and a marine railway put up
where they repair their steamers when needed.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
