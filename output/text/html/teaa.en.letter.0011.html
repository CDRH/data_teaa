Huntsville, Alabama,
December 6, 1858.

Sir,

The President having some time since 
tendered me the appointment of Consul
of the United States at Loanda, I have
felt anxious to so arrange my private
affairs as to be able to accede to his
wishes and to proceed as soon as possible
to the post assigned me. I regret
now, however, to be compelled to advise
you that imperious circumstances deny
me the pleasure, at present, of obeying
this call to the public service. I, therefore,
most respectfully decline the acceptance
of the tender made me; and in doing
so, beg leave, through your Department,
to offer to the President my sincere acknowledgements
for this evidence of his
favor and confidence.

Please accept, Sir, for yourself, assurances
of the high regard, political and
personal, with which I have the honor to be,

Truly and faithfully,
Your Obt Servt,
W. D. Miller.

Lewis Cass,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
Washington City.
