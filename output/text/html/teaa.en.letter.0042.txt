United States Commercial Agency at
Loanda 13th January 1863

Sir,

As I am compelled to return 
to the Untied States in consequence of ill 
health, I beg to inform you that I leave 
in charge of this United States Commercial 
Agency Mr John G Willis as Acting Vice 
Commercial Agent, contrary to your dispatch
dated Washington 19th September last past 
acquainting me that his Services were
dispensed with.

With reference to this part of 
your dispatch I beg to state that there is no 
other American in whom I would be 
willing to hold myself responsible for, the 
said Mr Willis having held the Office from 
its first Appointment as United States 
Commercial Agent and during that 
period, to the best of my knowledge he
has

To The Honble
W. H. Seward
Secty of State
Washington D.C.
U.S.A.



has given satisfaction in the discharge of 
his official duties.

Mr Willis had some objections 
to take charge of the office, but by my urgent 
request he will hold it until the Department 
deem it necessary to appointment a Successor, 
if the appointment I have made does not meet
your views

I take passage to the
United States via England and on my 
arrival in the United States will present 
myself at Washington and then will be 
better able to give further particulars 
respecting the Agency

Very respectfully
Your Obdt Servant
Robert Cunningham
Vice Coml Agt.
