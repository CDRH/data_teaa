Asst. Secty of State
Washington D.C.


Sir

I have the honor to State that by reports received from the 
consular agent at Mossamedes that the Am. Whaling
Rks "Herculus" Capt. J. Mac Swiss and "Milton" Capt
J. B. Bolter were at that port during the month of 
October, also that the Milton ran on shore since, but
got off alright. Mossamedes was infected also with 
small pox. The report from Benguela is only 
mentioning that several of the Am: missionaries
from Balinbu were at Benguela buying some goods 
to Barter in the interior. The consul agent at 
Ambriz informs me of the arrival of Mr Baxter
an Am Missionary from Gaboon who came there by
reason of ill health: beside writting the following viz:
"Am: trading vessels may be said to have ceased
running to this part of the coast altogether with
their usual cargo such as lumber, tobacco, came
far &amp;a &amp;a But there is another important hand 
of our trade and I have no doubt whatever
if the matter is properly looked into, it 
might eventually lead to the opening 



up of an extensive commerce.

I mean the manufacture of common ordinary cloth
suitable for this trade, such as greys and stripped 
Domestics, why cannot the American Mills
Compete with the Manchester, and with the cotton
ready to their hands. Some few years ago, they
did compete successfully with Manchester; actually 
exporting Am: made greys to Manchester for sale!
I am at a loss to know why this was never 
unless the Manchester men cut their prices of one
that it discouraged the American manufacturer
from persevering. Should you deem my idea 
of any value, I shall be glad to forward you 
samples of goods indicated, and would feel
desirous of knowing at what prices in English
currency they could be delivered to Liverpool for 
US shipment; or bought and direct from the U.S."

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your most obedient servant
L. de R. du Verge
US Consul.
