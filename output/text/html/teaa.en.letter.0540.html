No 5.

Consulate of the United States,
St. Paul de Loanda, October 12, 1889

Honorable Wm F. Wharton
Assistant Acting Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

In accordance with the
request contained in your
circular dated August 16, 
1889, I have the honour to 
forward herewith a few copies
of scores for a band, of native
airs. There does not exist, as 
far as I can gather, any patriotic
song, the words used in singing
being improvised to suit the
occasion.

As no printed copies of these
airs exist I had to apply to the
Military Band Master here
to furnish me with the copies,
and for which he charged
me Rs 5$000 = to $4 60/100, and
I



I have now to ask that the 
Department will be pleased to 
allow this item, which will 
appear in my account for the 
quarter ending in December
next.

I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant
Ed Bannister
Acting Vice Consul.
