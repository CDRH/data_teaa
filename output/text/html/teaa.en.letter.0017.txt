Loanda Octo 23, 1860.

Sir.

Herewith I enclose Returns
from the Commercial Agency for the Quarter
ending Sept 30 '60. The General accounts &amp;
Certificates I have directed to the Treasury Department,
&amp; have drawn on the Hon. Secretary
of the Treasury for $189.12Â¢ being balance of
my Salary for that Quarter.

I last had the honor of addressing you
under date of Sept 15th enclosing Returns for
the Quarter ending June 30th 60. Under this
date I informed your Honor that a large number
of Troops had arrived here from Lisbon. I now
have to add that a Fever resembling the Yellow
Fever has broken out among them &amp; nearly one
hundred have died within the past month.
As yet it is mostly confined to the Hospital among
the Soldiers, although there have been cases outside.
All who have as yet died with this disease have
lately arrived here &amp; it may possibly be Ship Fever.
I enclose the Bolletin in which you will perceive
the Government are endeavoring by cleanliness
&amp;c



Hon Lewis Cass
Secretary of State

&amp;c to prevent the disease from spreading.

This Agency is very, much in want of a
new flag,. also Forms Nos 14, 30, &amp; 44. Will you
be pleased to direct them to be sent. Vessels belonging
to the House of Brookhouse &amp; Co Salem,
Mass. leave there every two months for this Port &amp;
will forward anything the Department may desire.

Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt
