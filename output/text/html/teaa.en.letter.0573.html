Bathurst River Gambia
25th November 1858

Sir,

I have the honor to 
report my arrival in this Colony 
on the 4th instant.

Having applied to His
Excellency Governor O'Connor for 
leave to act as Commercial Agent,
of the United States, without an
Exequatur. I have received his 
despatch of yesterday's date, which 
I have the honor to enclose, refusing
to recognize me as such, without the 
sanction of the British Government.

I respectfully suggest
that it would perhaps be well to 
forward said despatch to London 
when application is made for an
Exequatur, which I trust will be done.

To the Honorable Lewis Cass
Secretary of State &amp;c &amp;c



done with as little delay as possible
as my present position in regard to
American vessels is so doubtful.

Now that an Exequatur
is necessary, rendering null thereby
one of the object of the appointment 
of Commercial Agents, why not 
make this a Consulate under
Schedule C: that I may rank with 
the Consular Representative of 
France in this place.

This port is certainly more
important to American interests
than Monrovia, Gaboon or St. Paul
de Loanda; why would not the same
salary be just? the amount of fees
on about thirty vessels per annum
is quite inadequate to the services 
required.

The Case containing Record
Books, Flags, &amp;c has not yet been
received from Monoria, neither has



the seal: Wheatons Elements of
International Law, the Consular
Regulations and some blank forms
were received in New York.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient &amp; humble servt
Danl RB Upton
U.S. Commercial Agent
