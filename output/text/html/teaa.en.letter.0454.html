No. 15

Commercial Agency of the United States,
Boma Nov 10 1889
(Written en route)

Honorable W. H. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform 
the Department that the Dutch
Steamer did not sail as was
intended, and I was obliged
to take the Liverpool Steamer
which after a postponement
of ten days finally sailed.
I will however arrive within
the 90 days allowed me for
transit. As this vessel proceeds
direct to Boma.

I have, by advice of the 
Authorities of the State, purchased
a quantity of provisions for
myself also personal outfit
for further use in the Upper
Congo. As on account of



the large increase of the white
population incident to the
building of the railroad and
the starting of the new companies
mentioned in my despatch No
12 (Report on Lower Congo). The
State cannot give me food 
lodging &amp;c &amp;c as it had hoped
but can only furnish me
transport on steamers and an
armed force when necessary

It would be useless to
start for the Upper Congo with
less than six months supplies
and I have been obliged
to avail myself of the
permission granted by the
Department and draw in
advance upon the Appropriation
in order to start well supplied.

I hope to start for
the Upper Congo shorty after
my arrival at Boma, and 
before the wet season has 
well advanced. Once 



the small rivers are smaller
is difficult, is both
difficult and .

I would also mention
mention that porters are now
paid in gold. And I am
informed the price has greatly
increased in six months

I am told that some
gentlemen interested in the
Congo Work wish to increase
the Appropriation for Expense 
as regard work on the
Upper Congo so that it
can be continued, and finished,
without waiting for each yearly
Appropriation to become available

Should this matter be
started, I hope the Department
will favorably consider it
and endorse it for it 
will greatly facilitate my
work to be able to start in
and work, knowing that an ample
Appropriation for my



necessary expenses was available.

I am Sir
Very Respectfully,
E. H. Taunt
U.S. Com. Agt Boma
