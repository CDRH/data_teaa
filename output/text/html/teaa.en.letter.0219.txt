Sir,

I have the honor to acknowledge 
dispatch No 43, dated May 6th,
1886 from the Department of State
inclosing a draft of a new treaty 
and a "Full Power" from the President
for you to conclude the
same.

I at once placed myself in
communication with His Highness
the Sultan of Zanzibar and
sent him a draft of the proposed
treaty.

His Highness expressed himself
as very much gratified that the
United States Government was
willing to make a new treaty
to his advantage.  The treaty was
immediately drawn up in the
English



English and Arabic languages, and
on the third July is was signed
by myself and H. H. Plenipotentiary.

The treaty was made in duplicate; 
our copy is inclosed
with this dispatch the other
is in His Highness possession.

I have read over carefully the
English &amp; German treaties and I
cannot see that there are any advantages.
that they get that is not 
afforded us

His Highness the Sultan did
not raise one question, but ordered
the treaty got ready.

I am greatly indebted to our
Kanji Ragpah, a native gentleman
here who is an intimate friend
of the Sultan, in getting the treaty
through so quickly.

I have the honor to be Sir
Your obedient servant
F. M. Cheney
U.S. Consul
