No 74

United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
24th May 1881

Sir

I have the honor to
again draw your attention to my
Despatch No 56 dated as far back as
23rd July 1880, and I hear from
Mr Colville that the Bills drawn by
him have not been accepted as yet.
consequently I am obliged to pay to
this gentleman the amount of Salary
he ought to have received during my
absence in England viz:



June 30th 1879
$172.08


Sept 30th " 
$250.00


Dec  31st " 
$231.61


Jany 12th 1880
$32.96


Total
$686.65



I therefore beg to draw the 
attention of the Department to this;
and to place the matter before them 
if they think it just that I should
pay this amount without receiving
any recompense from the Government

Mr



Mr Colville was appointed
with the sanction of the Department,
and with the understanding that he
would receive the salary during my 
absence, as has been hitherto the
custom; otherwise I do not think he 
would have accepted the Appointment,
and there was no other person that
I could have delivered the Consulate
to at the time.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
Robt S Newton
Vice-Consul

To the 
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
