Sir:

I have the honor to inform

As 8 A.M. the Sultan's flag
was raised and was
saluted by the Foreign
Ships of War in harbor:
at the same time the Consular 
flags which had been
half-masted for three days
out of respect to the late
Sultan were replaced by
the large national Ensigns.

From 9 till 11 A.M.
His Majesty received the
different delegations in 
the



in the following order, viz:
English, American, French,
German, Portuguese, Italian
and Austrian, each delegation 
being honored by a 
consular salute from
H.M.S. "Glasgow".

On the occasion of our
visit His Majesty expressed
the hope that the pleasant
relations heretofore existing
between the two countries
might continue and declared 
that, to this end,
he should be governed by
the precedents established
by the former Sultans of
Zanzibar. His Majesty
also informed me that he was
about sending to the President
of the United States, a cable
message - a copy of which
is enclosed.

I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant

His Excellency the President

I have to inform your

of God my brother Seyyid

It will be my most
earnest endeavor to continue 
and increase the
friendship which has so
long existed between Zanzibar 
and the United States
and I confidently rely
upon Your Excellency's support 
and assistance to
this end.

Ali bin Said
