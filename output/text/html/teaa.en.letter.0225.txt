No 114.

United States Consulate
Zanzibar, January 30th 1887

To the Hon.
Third Assit. Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
you that the German
operations on this Coast have
so far resulted in the acquisition 
of a strip of mangrove
swamp and marsh land some
forty miles long, situated on the
Coast about two hundred miles
North of Zanzibar, also a German
protectorate is acknowledged
for Witu, and the lease of two
Custom Houses on the Coast
to the German East African Trading
Company. the Sultan's 
authority is restricted to a strip
of coast land ten miles wide 
extending from Tunge Bay to 
Kapermie and ten miles around
Each of



Each of his Bin Addah towns, 
but the terms of this agreement
are I suppose more familiar 
to the Department than to me.

At the time of writing my
Despatch No. 106, in which I
suggest that a man-of-war
be sent here on account of this
German incident, feeling against
white-men in town was very
bitter and there was every prospect
of trouble, but at present the
negotiations are progressing favorably
&amp; quietly and there
is now no necessity for a man-of-war
to call here, although 
it always has a good effect, and 
I should very much like to 
see one of our gun-boats in
the harbor for a month or two
just at present.

The workings of the new 
tariff on articles imported in 
to the island of Zanzibar
from the mainland are not
wholly



wholly satisfactory. this is
especially applicable to Ivory, 
the market price of which it
is very difficult to fit, and the
Sultan's Collector of Customs
at present is a most unsuitable
man for the place and who
uses his position unfairly to
further his own business; he
also, by buying small lots at
high prices keeps the price of
Ivory far above what it should
be. as my commercial position
in Zanzibar is principally to
buy Ivory this affects me directly.

As soon as the German
affair is settled, the Sultan
will be forced to summon this
Collector and observe the spirit 
as well as the letter of the treaties.
I am personally in sympathy
with the Germans &amp; English
in this moment although
I am aware that our Government
does not wish to interfere
in any way



in any way with the internal
affairs of the Sultan's Government
but I think that a joint protest 
of the German, English and
American Consuls against this
man's continuing in office will
benefit all nationalities without
unpleasant complications. 

I have to report the death
of the Interpreter of this Consulate
Johami bin Saif on the 29th inst.
after a service of nearly forty years:
his place will probably be filled
by an appointee of Consul Pratt's
after he takes over the office.

I have the honor to be Sir
Your Obedient Servant
E. D. Roper Jr
Act'g U.S. Consul.
