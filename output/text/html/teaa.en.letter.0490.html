St. Paul de Loanda 12. January, 1888.

To Henry F. Downing, Esq.
U.S. Consul,
St. Paul de Loanda,

Dear Sir:

In answer to your letter of the 9th
inst., with reference to your Consular drafts; the
reason we object to your drafts, is that we have
no business with America, and to send your
drafts to America, and pay commission for
collecting and remitting to England, costs
us a considerable amount, and such drafts
are of little use to us as a remittance in a 
commercial way.

If you could give us drafts on
England, we should be happy to take them
at par and think the Government will have
no difficulty in this, having agents in London.

We are dear Sir,
Yours truly,
Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co.
