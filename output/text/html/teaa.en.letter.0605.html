To
Hon: John Davis
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.

Sir

I have the honor most respectfully
to lay before you the fallowing facts
compelling me to resign my post
Viz. 1st By continuous sickness, I feel
unfit to perform conscientiously my
duty of consul for the United States 
of America

2d Although I have followed my
Doctor's advice and gone South
and North in my jurisdiction; 
I feel my health declining every
day, so much so, that I cannot
at time walk without and the help
of a servant

3d My expences here for Doctors,
Medicine, and help; are greater 
then I can pay; I parted with



my wife and sent her Home while
I had the opportunity to do so.

4th Today, If I go Home, I will be
compelled to take a second class 
passage

5th If the State Department cannot
transfer me to a better climate,
no matter where; I would most
respectfully Sir tender you my 
resignation.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Very respectfully
Your obedient servant
