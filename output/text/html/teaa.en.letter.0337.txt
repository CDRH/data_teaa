United States Commercial Agency at Gaboon
February 22nd 1878

Hon William M Evarts,
Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir;

I am happy to inform the Department, that another
enterprise has been started for the purpose of utilizing 
the grand discoveries, recently made by our countryman,
Mr. H. M Stanley on the Congo or Livingston Messers 
Strom and Craven, two lay Missionary gentlemen, 
one route for the Congo, have passed a part of two 
days with me at this Agency. They have been sent 
out by philanthropic Merchants in Liverpool &amp;
London; to asscend the south bank of the Congo 
to a point above the first rapids, where they are 
to establish an industrial Christian Mission. 
These christian enterprises will prepare the way 
for the extention of commerce, &amp; steam navigation 
upon those vast interior rivers, &amp; the development
of the valuable material resources of Ethiopia.

I remain,
Sir,
Respectfully,
Your Obedient Servant
Albert Bushnell,
U.S. Com. A.
