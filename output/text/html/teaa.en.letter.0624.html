United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
January 15 1884

Sir

Mr du Verge by letter dated
Novr 3 1883, of which copy is herewith
enclosed, having informed me that he
intended to proceed to the United States
on leave of absence granted to him
by the Department, and being now in
charge of the Consulate, I have to
acknowledge the receipt of your
despatch No 20 of the 26th October
last, informing Mr du Verge that his
nomination of Francisco Martens Swart
as Vice Consul to succeed me has been 
approved, and enclosing a blank form
of bond which should be executed and 
returned



returned to the Department of State 
with information as to Mr Swart's 
nationality.

In compliance with this request I have
to inform you that Mr Swart is a 
Portuguese subject and a merchant
of this place, holding the appointment
of Spanish Vice Consul, but left for 
Europe in the month of July last
and is still absent; and I have not
any means of knowing the exact date
he intends to return, or whether as
is rumoured, he purposes residing
permanently in Lisbon.

I have therefore the honor to return 
the blank the blank force of bond
for such ulterior measures as may be
deemed fit.

Having thus become acquainted with 
the



the fact of being suspended without
having tendered my resignation, or
informed in anyway by Mr du Verge
of his having nominated Mr Swart
to fulfil the duties of Vice Consul—an
appointment not intimated to or 
acknowledged by the local Government—
I am reluctantly compelled to conclude 
that the Department must have been 
altogether misinformed on the subject,
and the representations made by 
Mr du Verge a compilation of
mistatements, which would appear
to be a leading characteristic of that 
officer in nearly all transactions
connected with his proceedings when
here.

As however Mr du Verge has
taken with him the official 
correspondence



correspondence book and the various 
despatches, prior to the one now adverted
to, I am unable to see on what grounds 
he demanded my substitution, after a 
service which has, for the last fourteen 
years been approved of by the Government

Under these circumstances I 
have to submit whether, conformably
with official procedure, and as a matter
of personal satisfaction, the Department
will not, prior to re-confirming
Mr Swart's nomination, transmit to 
me a copy of Mr du Verge's despatch or despatches
on the subject, in order that I may
offer such explanations as the case
warrants.

Mr du Verge may or may 
not have been actuated by 
consideration of a higher nature
than



than personal disappointment at
finding me unwilling to connect
him with my commercial house,
and although he had no grounds
for such expectations, his subsequent
proceedings in the Congo (where he
was employed at a salary, I understand
of £400 a year) as chief of the Vivi 
station of the Stanley Expedition, and
his compulsory retirement from that
post at the request of Major General
Sir Frederick Goldsmid, who came
out to the Congo last year, on a special
mission from the King of the Belgians,
have not tended to produce that 
confidence which should have
distinguished an officer of the Consular
Service, and who had not gained the 
consideration or respect either of the 
Governor



Governor General of this Province or
of the higher class of inhabitants of
this town

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your Obedient Servant
Robt S. Newton
U.S. Vice Consul

To the 
Assistant Secretary of State
