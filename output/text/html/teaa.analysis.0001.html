Summary

The General Act of the Berlin Conference was signed on February 26, 1885 at the close
of the Berlin Conference of 1884-5. The signatories of the act represented the United
States, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary,
the Netherlands, Russia, Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and United Kingdoms of Norway
and Sweden. The General Act, once ratified, bound the signatory nations to combating
the continental slave trade in Africa, recognizing the sovereignty of the Congo Free
State, respecting the protectorates and territorial possessions already present in
Africa, and insuring the free navigation of the Congo and Niger Rivers and their tributaries.
On the latter point, the Act dictated that railroads, roads, and "lateral canals"
connected to the rivers be zones of free commerce and navigation. It made provisions
to establish the International Commission of Navigation of the Congo to oversee this.
(See Article 20)

Additionally, by declaring the free navigation of the Niger, the Act ended the British
and French dispute over which nation held sovereignty over the river. The Act also
outlined the boundaries of the Congo Basin and committed all signatories to insuring
"commercial liberty" in the basin, its embouchures, and its "neighbouring country,
and dispositions connected therewith." Accordingly, the Act forbade commercial monopolies
in the Congo and prevented "powers" in the region from enacting import and export
duties on goods brought into the region for twenty years. Mindful that foreign travel
to Africa had increased during the nineteenth century, the Act required the signees
to protect "natives," travelers, and missionaries, as well as guarantee "liberty of
conscience" and "religious toleration" for these persons. The conference attendees
charged each signee to urge their respective governments to ratify the document within
one year of its signing. The United States was the only power represented at the conference
that did not deposit its ratification with the Berlin Foreign Office by April 1886.1

The General Act, in many ways, recognized what was occurring on in the continent since
the early nineteenth century—the incremental penetration of the continent by Europeans,
predominantly. This penetration intensified in the 1860s and 1870s with such events
as Britain's punitive expedition against Abyssinia (1867-1868), King Leopold's claim
to the Congo Free State in 1876, and Henry Morton Stanley's Anglo-American Expedition
of 1878, to name a few. The dispute between France and Great Britain over Egypt in
the 1880s brought the question of control over Africa to a head. In the immediate
years following the signing of the Act and its ratification, European powers solidified
their control over West Africa, establishing protectorates with access to the Atlantic
coast. While the Act pledged to protect the natives and gave special protection to
"[C]hristian missionaries, the savants [scientists], the explorers, their escorts,
properties and collections," it became increasingly clear that the European powers
aimed to dispossess Africans of their most fertile lands, to mobilize African labor
(oftentimes violently) in service of the empire, to force Christianity on Africans,
and to decrease the influence of Islam on the continent. In the last decade of the
nineteenth century, European imperialist met resistance from African kingdoms, caliphates,
states, and acephalous societies. However, by the turn of the twentieth century, most
of Africa was under European control with the exception of Liberia and Abyssinia.2
