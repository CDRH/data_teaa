United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda April 7th 1863.

Sir,

Under date of January 15th, I
had the honor to address you stating
that I had at the request of Mr
Cunningham taken charge of this
Agency.

I now enclose Returns for the
Quarter ending March 31st 1863. The
several Accounts and Certificates I have
directed to the Treasury Department and
have drawn on the Honorable Secretary of
the Treasury for $219.14 Â¢ being balance
of my Salary for that Quarter.

I also enclose one half of the Register
of the American Bark "J. J. Cobb," which
I found in this office on my taking
charge and am therefore unable to give
you any further particulars respecting
the same.

The War in the States is now being
felt much in the advanced price of


To the Honble
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.




Cottons and certain kinds of Provisions
which American Vessels were accustomed to
bring here for Trade. The recall of the United
States Squadron from this Coast is also much
felt and it is hoped that circumstances may so
change as to warrant their being again placed
where there is so much need of their presence.

The Mails via England and Fernando
Po for the months of January and February
have not yet arrived here, consequently this
Agency is not in receipt of any advices from
the State Department for those months.


Very Respectfully
Your Obdt Servt
John G. Willis
U.S.  Coml Agent



May 6.
Nothing new of interest
to add, save that Mr. Watson Vredenburg
the newly appointed English Commissioner &amp; Consul
arrived some three weeks since.
