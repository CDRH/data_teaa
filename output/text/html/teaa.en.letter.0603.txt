To Hon. Josiah Quincy
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington

Sir:

Instruction no 19, of February 16, last,
by Hon. Wm. F. Wharton, informing me that
the property of the U.S. Commercial Agency
at Loanda Africa, "may remain, for the 
present, in the custody of Mr. L. C. Burling
of the M. E. Mission at Loanda" has in due
course of time reached me here.

For the guidance of the Department,
allow me to state that Mr. R. S. Newton,
formerly U.S. Vice-Consul at Loanda died at
Madeira on his way to England and that his
firm at Loanda is being dissolved.

Through no longer connected with the
department, I shall always be glad to



give the Consular Bureau any information
it may desire on African affairs, which
continue to be the special object of my 
studies.

The above address, or care of National
Museum Washington, will always find me.

I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
Late U.S. Coml Agent, Loanda, Africa
