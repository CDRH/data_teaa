United States Consulate
Zanzibar Sept 8, 1886

To the Hon
Third Assist. Sec'y of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to enclose 
herewith a letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the
Department of State, a copy of
which he has sent to the Consulate
and which I have translated
and also enclose herewith.

The sum and substance of
the communication is, a request 
of our Government to sanction
a tax on his own subjects, which
I have assured His Highness will
be undoubtedly granted him.

The Germans &amp; English as
a pretense for making trouble with
the Sultan, claim that he has no
right to levy any taxes or duties
on any produce raised in the 
Sultanate



Sultanate of Zanzibar other
than is specified in new
treaties, even on his own subjects.
The Sultan claims that he has 
a right to tax his own subjects
as he pleases and produce belonging
to them.

This is a matter which 
does not in the least concern
Americans or American interests 
in any way and which I
assume that our Government
will not care for me to take any
part in the troubles likely to arrive
from this dispute.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your Obedient Servant
E. D. Roper Jr
actg U.S. Consul.

Translation of a Letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the Secretary of State
Washington, Sept. 7. 1886.

Ver batim.

In the Name of God the merciful  &amp; lenient.

To his Excellency the noble, the liberal 
and learned minister of Foreign Affairs of 
the United States of America, may God prolong
his life in unblemished Glory!

We had the honor to inform you in a 
telegram of the 6th August that we directed
a letter to your Excellency, this is the letter.

We have the pleasure to inform your 
Excellency, that the new treaties with England 
and Germany and the new clauses about spirits
concluded with your country entered in force
on the 19th of August 1886 corresponding to the
Kisawahili New Year and that the Custom 
House is in our own hands.

I have to inform you that in the new
treaties are not mentioned fifty five articles
of produce of our coast and on which we always 
had 5% duty. This produce has nothing
to do with the imports and exports by Europeans.
It concerns



It concerns only my own people, who 
do not pay any other taxes, so we continue
to tax the fifty-five articles of produce as before
at 5%.

We send you the names of the fifty-five 
articles of named produce in a list
joined to the letter and ask you to consider
it and sanction it.  Salaams!

This letter was composed on the 7th
of September corresponding to the 6th of Til-Haj 
1303 of the Hejira.

Signed Barghash bin Saiid
Sultan
