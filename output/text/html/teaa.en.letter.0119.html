Dear Sir, Is there any way for us
to get even with W. H. Thomas
(Colored) a gent who is reported
to have been appointed U.S. Consul
at St. Paul D Loando Lower
Guinea Africa? This man some
weeks ago obtained from us under
false pretenses a R.R. Ticket
Reading Bellaire Ohio to New York
via Baltimore and after fair
promises &amp;c has skipped to Africa
the ticket was worth $11.25. We have
plenty of witnesses to the transaction
and can give oath to above statement



truly yours with respect
Ward Bros
