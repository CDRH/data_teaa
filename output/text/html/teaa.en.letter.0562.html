22d December 1857

Sir

I purpose showing your Excellency that the 
commerce of the United States with this place &amp; the
welfare of American citizens require the establishment
of an American Consulate at this port.

During the year about to end there have been Thirty one
American vessels here &amp; many  sharing the need 
of some one to care for &amp; empowered to protect
American interests.

Seamen have been discharged from their ships against
their will &amp; without their 3 months advance, have sickened
&amp; died, &amp; once have been left behind in the Colonial 
Hospitals &amp; upon their recovery have ascertained that 
their ship had left &amp; in one case taking away the 
clothes of the seaman.

A case has thus come under my . A Mr Lee
2d Mate of the Bark Turk of Salem Mass was
discharged from his vessel without his 3 months wages.
Came to me in distress. I gave him employment.
it was during the sickly season. he was soon taken
ill with the African fever. I obtained lodging for 
him, sent my own Doctor to treat him (whose Bill
I now enclose hoping that I may be reimbursed)
upon his recovery there being no American vessels
here I obtained a passage for him to London.



A petition in my favor signed by most of the African
merchants of New York &amp; many other private 
influential persons has already been filed in
the Department of State praying for the establishment 
of a Consulate here. The late Commander
in Chief of the Squadron Commodore Crable was 
quite aware of the necessity of a Consulate &amp; 
me that he has communicated with your Excellency
relative thereto &amp; has recommended me for that 
post.

I  that your Excellency will deign to give
your attention to this matter.

I am 
Your Excellency's 
Most Obdt. &amp; humble Servant
Danl R. B. Upton

To His Excellency 
The Honorable Lewis Cass
Secretary of State
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
