Hon.
William M. Everts
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform you that we
have recently received a visit at this
part, from the United States Steamer
Essex, Commander W. S. Schley. she
remained a week, during which
time, we enjoyed the pleasant society
of Commander Schley, and his
gentlemanly officers, from whom we
received very kind and courteous
attentions. Permit me to make
honorable mention of the French-Commandant
Capt. J. Boitard
who promptly furnished Commander
Schley with all needfull supplies,
to enable him to continue his 
voyage to the Congo and



St Paul de Loando. The visit
of this beautiful ship. with her
truly and Patriotic gentlemanly
Commander and officers, will
promote American interest in this
part of Africa; and I trust in
future, we may more frequently
receive visits from our national
vessels, than we have done since
the late war

I beg to remain
Sir:
Most Respectfully,
Your obedient servant
Albert Bushnell
U.S. Com. Agent
