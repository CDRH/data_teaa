Mossamedes 1st of November 1882.

Without any favor from you to answer, I satisfy my last of the
8th of october per S.S. "Benguella." "Samples of produce
from the district": Enclosed please find a bill of lading
for a box of samples of the produce of Mossamedes, which
will be sent on by the first packet, due in a few days, the
said samples consist of:

Orchilla

Indn Corn
Rum
Wheat
Almeidina

With regard to these samples, I must say 
that Almeidina, is a produce from which
50 P.C. of good Indian Rubber is 
exhacted, what regards to wheat, this 
country has not produced anything to 
speak of, as they have not turned their 
attention to its cultivation, but lately and it has been
sown to considerable extent, and they sanguinely expect
a great result.

Produce exported from this Dispatch: as follows

Hides
Wax
Ivory
Dried Fish
Brine Do
Orchilla
Almeidina
Cotton
Vegetables
Fruits
Oxen
Cows
Sheep

"American Shipping" The Am: Ship "Shelton" Capt. S.B.
Potter, entered this port on the 7th of october sailed on 
the 19th of the same month; Whaling?
On the 12th of the same month entd America Bark
"Alice Knowles" Capt Thomas Foster, came in to request
and returned  Whaling on the 19th of the same. 
On the 10th of the same month entered Am. Ship
"Eliza Adams" Capt Walter F. Howland; also came in

From the Bark "Alice Knowles" the Sailor Henry
Williams was landed sick, and who will go 
on to your City by the first packet, leaving a 
Certificate from this agency dated october 26th 1882.
The "Eliza Adams" shipped  on the 25th ult. 4 sailors,
2 of which ran away immediately after signing
their articles and receiving 8 dollars and 50 cents
in advance; they were arrested 2 days after 
the sailing of the ship, and I intend
sending them on to your consulate by first
favorable opportunity that you may dispose
of them as you may think fit; It is probable
that I shall have to advance the money for
their passage of which I will duly advise
you. Their names are "David Miller" and
"Charles Sims". Another sailor, by name of 
"Augusto Fernandes" ran away from the said 
ship, and came to day to present himself to 
me; I shall send him also to you with 



with the other 2. and advise the amount of passages
and expences which I have advanced them here
It seems to me proper to send them to Loanda
that it may be known hereafter to all others
coming here in future, that such acts will not 
be countenanced without being punished
according to Law.

Being all for the present, I remain with all
due respect and consideration
"Signed" Jo√£o L. Torres

P.S. The sailor above described as "Augustus Fernandes,
is Augustus Jason".







I David Miller a native born of
New York do solemnly swear under 
oath what I shipped on board Am:
Ships "Eliza Adams" of New Bedford
Walter F. Howland, master at St. Helena
for 6 months on the 18th of April 1882
ad arrived at Mossamedes or
Little Fish Bay the latter part of
October 1882. Capt said to me do
you want your discharge &amp; I
said yes; he answered you shan't
have it as I have to pay the Consular
Agent; and told him I did not
know how that was; I was unwell
&amp; not fit to go again on board, I 
also asked him what was due me,
he said very little you son of a ----
&amp; he at once gave orders to his officers
to give me plenty work to do, &amp; so
tie me up to the rigging if I did
not do it; I went on shore on leave 
of absence a four day after, but
now returned. I reshipped and
received $8.50 in advance, but
when I found out that I had



shipped again in the same vessel
after all the bad treatment I had
already received, I ran away with
the advance received and hid myself 
in the bushes, living on fruits
only for a few days, after the ship's
departure I went and reported myself 
to the Consular Agent, but was arrested 
by the police who had been searching 
for me &amp; brought to the Consular 
Agent who put me at once in a 
boarding house sent me to Loanda
by the Portuguese mail steamer

I regret to have deserted, but 
it was impossible for me to bear
any longer the ill treatment received 
from the Capt. &amp; officers of the
Eliza Adams. I am now here, Sir
as you see me, almost nude, with 
nothing else but the old pants &amp;
coat I have on, &amp; I wish &amp; pray
you to send me home by the 
first chance

So help me God.
Signed) David Miller

I, Augustus Jason, "seaman" do
solemnly swear &amp; take oath and
affirm, that I am 18 years of age
a native of New Bedford, &amp; shipped
in St Helena April 1882, on board
the ship "Eliza Adams" of New
Bedford for 12 months Walter
F. Howland, master; and arrived in 
"Mossamedes" on Little Fish Bay 
October 18th 1882

I swam on shore &amp; deserted, the
distance from the ship to the shore
was about 1 3/4 miles. The cause of
my running away from the vessel
was brutal treatment from the 
3rd mate Mr Joe Smith he being
encouraged by the other officers
&amp; Capt. ordering him to have me
well beaten. I served six months
on said vessel &amp; found it impossible
to hear the abuse any longer.
I ran away &amp; hid myself in the 
bushes until the vessel left
port, &amp; when I went to report 
myself to the Consular Agent



was arrested by the police, who
had been sent after me said
my desertion. The Consular
Agent treated me well while in
Mossamedes &amp; sent me to this
Consulate. My greatest desire
is to return home, I am sorry
that I ran away, but I beg to
state that the ill treatment I 
received on board for six months
was more than man could bear;
I am here bare footed having
only the jumper &amp; overhauls that
you see on me, &amp; I beg help
from my Govt. I also state
that I can bear witness, that
the named, Charles Sims and
David Miller, of the same vessel
were also ill treated &amp; brutally
abused by the officers &amp; master

So help me God

I Henry Williams "boat steerer" on
board Am: Bark "Alice Knowles"
of New Bedford "Thomas Foster"
master, do solemnly swear &amp; affirm
under oath, that I have been on
board of said Alice Knowles for
about 3 1/2 years, during which time
I only received from the master
the sum of $36 00/100 in all, that I 
never refused duty while on board 
and was sent on shore at Little Fish
Bay or "Mossamedes" by the Capt.
on account of sickness. While on
shore here the Consular Agent
took good care of me &amp; sent me
to a boarding house until the
Portuguese Steamer left for Loanda,
&amp; I believe that the Consular Agent
paid my passage to this Consulate.

The Consular Agent gave me $13
of which I expended $1 while in 
Mossamedes, I now have in my 
possession $12. When I was sent on
shore by the Capt's order I did not
sign clear of the Articles, but he



Capt gave me this letter "Letter Enclosed"
to the owner of New Bedford.
My agreement with the master was
that I should have for my self
a barrel of oil for every 90 barrels on
board; From the slop chest I received
only $15.25. I was laid up 3 1/2
weeks sick on shore at Mossamedes
waiting the arrival of the Portuguese 
Mail Steam ship for this port.
I never signed or put any mark 
to any kind of paper or document;
the Capt. told me tat I would
receive on my arrival at New Bedford
$9.00 for my shore, which I think is 
specified in the letter he gave me
for the owner. I am now at the 
mercy of his Consulate sick and 
destitute, a stranger in a foreign
country &amp; not able to explain in good
English as I am a native of the 
Sandwich Islands but have sailed
on Am: Whaling vessels for the last 25 
years; I beg your Excellency to send
me to New Bedford &amp; to see that an



old man as I am, sick with paralysis
so, is not cheated out of his hard
earned money

So help me God
Signed, Henry Williams

I Charles Sims "seaman" do
solemnly swear &amp; take oath: that I
arrived at Little Fish Bay or "Mossamedes"
on board ships  "Eliza Adams" of New 
Bedford, "Walter F. Howland" master
in October 1882: My time had
expired upon my arrival at
"Mossamedes," having served one
year on board according to contract;
I told the Capt. of the fact; and
received ill treatment from him
and his officers; he telling me d-d
the Consul at St Helena or any
other one, I'll show you I am
master of this craft &amp; I'll drive you
son of --- to hell if you do not 
work &amp; do your duty, using in
the meantime his fists on my
face &amp; all kinds of language.

I deserted and shipped again
a few days after for six months
at the Consular Agent's office, but
I found out that I had shipped
back on the same vessel, I again
deserted after receiving from the



Consular Agent $8.50 advance which
I thought I might keep for wages
due me by the master; as to go back 
on the same ship and was impossible
for me to do so; as the Captain and
officers would have killed me during
that six months.

I was arrested by the order of the
Consular Agent at Mossamedes, but
too take to be sent on board. The
Consular Agent after keeping me a 
few days sent me here as you see
me now without shoes or hat; and 
having only the old for  pants and shirt
which cover me and I beg your honor
to send me home to New Bedford
if possible. I also state that I
have been often an eye witness of 
the beating &amp; ill treatment that
Augustus Jason and David Miller
received on board.

So help me God
