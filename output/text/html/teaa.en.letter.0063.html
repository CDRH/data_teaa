United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda July 28th 1865.

Sir,

I have the honor to invite the
attention of the Department to my
request in Despatch No. 2 for an
additional supply of Blanks
Nos 44, 14, 8, 142, 143, 144, 130, respectively

I would also ask the Department
to furnish me with two flags as
those now in use are considerably
worn. I would like to have them
of a large size say 15 x 10 feet,
as my residence requires one of 
that size.


I have the honor to be
Your most Obdt Servt
Augustus Archer Silva
