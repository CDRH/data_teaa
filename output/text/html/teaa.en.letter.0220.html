United States Consulate
Zanzibar, August 15th, 1886

To the Hon
Third Assist. Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to request the
Department of State to inform me
if any allowance will be made me
for making the new treaty with the
Sultan of Zanzibar.

I consider that such work is
outside of the line of a Consul's duty
and it made a great deal of extra
work and trouble, as is always the
case in these Oriental countries.

The Treaty was to be got through
in a great hurry and it was only
from my being as any old friend of
the Sultan's that it was finished
in as short a time.

The salary of this Consulate 
is only $1000 per annum and I
consider that $500 would be a fair
recompense for my outside work on this 
new treaty.



My address in the United States
is c/o Messrs. Arnold, Hines &amp; Co.
158 Water St. 
New York, N.Y.

I have the honor to be, Sir
Your Obedient Servant,
F. M. Cheney
U.S. Consul
