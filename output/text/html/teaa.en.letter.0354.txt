Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar June 23 1890

Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to address 
the Department at this
time in relation to affairs
on the Brava Coast.
On the 7th instant I cabled
as follows viz:

"State Department
Washington.
Brava Coast unsettled
American interests jeopardized
Pratt"

By letters received on
that date we learned of an
uprising of the natives at
Muka and that they had
looted the town - securing
some 150  the American
house of Roper  &amp; Co.
and



and upwards of 5000
from British Indian merchants.

Messrs Roper  &amp; Co.
who have large interests
at stake in that vicinity
immediately consulted with
me and it was at their
earnest solicitation that
I cabled the Department.
It being understood
that my cablegram would
supplement my statement
made to the Department by
representatives of R.E. &amp; Co.
who would visit Washington 
for that purpose.

The primary cause of
the disturbance is the concession 
of the Coast to the
Imperial British East
Africa Company and through
them to the Italians.
Having



Having spent some
months on the Brava Coast
and having acquainted
myself with the habits and
disposition of the natives
of that country. I am certain 
that any move in
the direction of European
interference will result in
complete demoralization.

The Italians disclaim
any present intention of
placing Europeans in that
district, and propose to
administer affairs from
Zanzibar.

During a recent
interview with the Sultan
I expressed the hope that
he would discourage the
visits of Foreign ships of
war to that coast and
suggested that His Majesty 
send one of his own
ships with a commissioner
empowered



empowered to  with
the natives. His Majesty
proceeded to do so 
that such a course
will be  for
some  to the
difficulty in making a
landing at this season.

By the granting of
the concession to the Imperial
British East African Company
the estate states of affairs
has been altered. Yet
I trust that the Department
may see its way clear
to call a halt in the direction
of European occupation
of this coast since otherwise
the Americans engaged
in that trade will suffer
a great loss, and perhaps
be compelled to retire
altogether from this hitherto
profitable field of
operations.

I



I await the sanction
of the Department before
sending in accounts for
cost of cablegram before
.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
Seth A. Pratt
U.S. Consul
