United States Commercial Agency at Gaboon.
February 9th 1878.

Hon. William M. Evarts
Secretary of State. 
Washington D.C.

Sir; 

I am happy to inform the Department, that I am 
encouraged to expect an increase of American commerce 
at this port. A circular has just been received, stating that 
"the long established house of Messrs Mansfield &amp; Roberts,
127 state street Boston, propose to open &amp; extend a permanent 
business on the coast; &amp; that one of their large Barks may be 
expected at Gaboon about the 1st of March, with a general 
cargo." The French Commandant has just informed me
of the probibility, that the Government will soon build a 
large En-tre-po at Gaboon, for the convenience of commerce;
which will vastly increase the business at this port &amp;
make it a great commercial center, for West Equatorial
Africa. During my anticipated visit to the United States,
I hope to interest our Merchants in African commerce;
which Christian Civilization is rapidly developing 
as well as philanthropists &amp; christians in the great work 
of African exploration &amp; christianization. I have a 
Revised Grammar &amp; Dictionary of the Mponguic language.
I send a translation of more than 20 books of the Bible, to



publish at the Bible House in New York; while 
recruiting my much enfeebled strength. 

I have the honor to be,
Sir; 
Most Respectfully,
Your Obedient Servant;
Albert Bushnell
U.S. Coml Agent.
