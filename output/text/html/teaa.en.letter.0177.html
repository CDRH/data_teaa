Office of the Consul-General of the Republic of Liberia,
Room 27, Bible-House.

New York, March 17, 1863

Honorable Wm. H. Seward
Secretary of State

Dear Sir,

The daily
papers of this city announced a few days since that
there had been an exchange of the ratified Treaty with
Liberia through our Minister at London.

I would like to publish the Treaty in the forthcoming
number of the New York Colonization Journal and write
ask for a copy of it for that purpose. Will you oblige
me by directing a copy to me if it is in print?

I see steady development of the military organization
of the freed slaves &amp; conclude that until the rebellion is 
conquered it will not be a part of the Government policy
to encourage emigration anywhere.

I am Very Respectfully Yours
J. B. Pinney
