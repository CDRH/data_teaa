No 24.

United States Consulate

Honorable James D. Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have to request of
the Department instructions
in relation to the Article in
the English and German
treaties stipulating that 
goods may be landed here
in bond, for a period not 
exceeding six months.

This question is liable
to arise at any time
and I should be glad to know just what rights
might



might be claimed by Americans 
under this article.

The clause in the
new treaties relating to the 
duty of twenty-five per cent
in spirituous liquors, is practically
a dead-letter, from
the fact that France has
not assented to the application
of the Revised Tariff
of Zanzibar to the Exports
of France entering this
country. 

Naturally, the English 
and German merchants objected
to paying any higher
duty on spirituous liquors
than was being paid by
the French i.e. five per cent
and



and the new rate (25%) 
consequently could not be 
sustained.

The Sultan doubtless
having in mind the fact
that this new rate was intended
in part as a compensation 
for a reduction
of the duty in certain articles 
of the Export is not
inclined to allow the foreign
merchants any privileges under the new
treaties.

It is well known that
the Sultan does not look
with favor on the idea of
landing goods in bond
and he might possibly
object



object on the grounds mentioned 
above.

It is often a great
convenience — as well as a
saving of Expense — to Americans
engaged in business
here to land goods in
bond since in that way
a vessel might proceed
direct to her destination
without stopping at an
intermediate port.

I am Sir
Your Obedient Servant
Seth A. Pratt
U.S. Consul.
