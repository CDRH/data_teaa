you, that having again applied
to His Excellency Governor
O'Connor for permission to act 
as Commercial Agent of the
United States temporarily, subject
to the approval of Her Majesty's
Government; I have received in 
reply his Despatch dated the 
11th. Instant, granting my 
request: which I now beg to 
enclose.

Nothing now remains
but that, the Exequatur may 
be forthcoming as soon as
possible.

On the 14th instant the Flag 
of the United was hoisted
on this Consulate for the first
time in Gambia, in fact, I believe,
for the first time on the West
Coast of Africa, i.e. British Colonies.

I am much inconvenienced
by not having yet received a
Consular Seat or the cases from
Monrovia containing the Record
Books stationary &amp;c.

I hope to have the honor
to receive a reply, to my several
Despatches since my arrival
here, by the coming mail due 
on the 7th proximo.
