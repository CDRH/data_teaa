The Honorable J. C. Bancroft Davis
Asst. Secty of State
Washington D.C.


Sir

I have the honor most respectfully
to state what Msrs "J. Laurentine Torres
of Mossamedes," "Richard Foster of 
Ambriz" and "J. J. Vieria da Silva
of Benguela" were appointed by me
U.S. Consul Agents for said districts
until the approval and confirmation 
of the State Department.

These gentlemen are the most 
respected and wealthiest traders
of the above mentioned places, 
possessing sugar, coffee, and 
cotton plantations and are the 
best residents that I have found
upon inquiry able to represent the 
U.S. with honor.

My reasons in doing so have already been stated to the Dept.



in the despatch No. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and
have had since two cases of Newbedford
and Cape de Verde Island seamen
deserting from Am: Whalers at little 
fish bay, and coming upon this consulate
as destitute, but in both cases I was
able to allow them with their own 
consent to be shipped immediately
on Portuguese vessel and save to 
this consulate and the U.S. Govt.
trouble and expences.

I have now a very sick seaman
left at the hospital by the U.S. Vice 
Consul Mr. Newton which I will 
try to have forwarded by this mail
to Cape Verde, place of his residence

I have the honor to be
Sir 
Your most obedient servant
L. de R. du Verge
US Consul
