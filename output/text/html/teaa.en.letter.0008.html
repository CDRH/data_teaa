New York Nov 9th 1857.

Sir.

Some months since I had the
honor to receive from the State Department a leave of
absence from my post at St Paul de Loanda, West Coast
of Africa.

It was then my intention to resign on my arrival
in the States, but circumstances have since occurred by
which I intend to return. I now very respectfully
request your Honor to allow that liberty to extend till
next March, for the reason that I do not wish to arrive
on the Coast till after the months of March April &amp; May, 
as those months are considered the worst part of the year
on the S W Coast of Africa

I trust my past services &amp; attention to the duties
previous to the time of a Salary being affixed, have entitled
me to retain the Office for another term &amp; that my request 
may be granted.

It is my intention to visit Washington
previous to my departure as I have some important subjects
to lay before the Department.

Any communication you may have to call my
attention, please address me at No 158 Pearl St New York
City.

Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt
John G. Willis
U.S. Coml Agent at St Paul de Loanda




To
Hon Lewis Cass
US Secretary of State
Washington DC
