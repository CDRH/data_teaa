Who, furnished with full powers, which have been found in
good and due form, have adopted the following provisions: —







Chapter I.
Slave Trade Countries. — Measures to be Taken in Places of Origin.



Article I.

The Powers declare that the most effective means for counteracting
the Slave Trade in the interior of Africa are the
following: —

1. Progressive organization of the administrative, judicial,
religions, and military services in the African territories planed
under the sovereignty or Protectorate of civilized nations.

2. The gradual establishment in the interior by the responsible
Power in each territory of strongly occupied stations in such a way
as to make their protactive or repressive action effectively felt in
the territories devastated by man-hunts.

3. The construction of roads, and in particular of railways,
connecting the advanced stations with the coast, and permitting
easy access to the inland waters and to the upper reaches of
streams and rivers which are broken by rapids and cataracts, so as
to substitute economical and speedy means of transport for the
present means of portage by men.

4. Establishment of steam-boats on the inland navigable
waters and on the lakes, supported by fortified posts established on
the banks.

5. Establishment of telegraphic lines assuring the communication
of the posts and stations with the coast and with the administrative
centres.

6. Organization of expeditions and flying columns to keep up
the communication of the stations with each other and with the
coast, to support repressive action, and to ensure the security of
roadways.

7. Restriction of the importation of fire-arms, at least of modern
pattern, and of ammunition, throughout the entire extent of the
territories infected by the Slave Trade.





Article II.

The stations, the cruisers organized by each Power in its inland
waters, and the posts which serve as ports for them, shall, independently
of their principal task, which is to prevent the capture
of slaves and intercept the routes of the Slave Trade, have the
following subsidiary duties: —

1. To serve as a base, and, if necessary, as a place of refuge, for
the native populations placed under the sovereignty or the Protectorate
of the State to which the station belongs, for the independent
populations, and temporarily for all others in case of
imminent danger; to place the populations of the first of these
categories in a position to cooperate for their own defence; to
diminish intestine wars between tribes by means of arbitration; to
initiate them in agricultural works and in the industrial arts so as
to increase their welfare; to raise them to civilization and bring
about the extinction of barbarous customs, such as cannabalism and
human sacrifices.

2. To give aid and protection to commercial undertakings, to
watch over their legality, especially by controlling contracts of
service with natives, and to lead up to the foundation of permanent
centres of cultivation and of commercial establishments.

3. To protect, without distinction of creed, the Missions which
are already or may hereafter be established.

4. To provide for the sanitary service, and to grant hospitality
and help to explorers, and to all who take part in Africa in
the work of repressing the Slave Trade.





Article III.

The Powers exercising sovereignty or Protectorate in Africa, in
order to confirm and give greater precision to their former declarations,
undertake to proceed gradually, as circumstances permit,
either by the means above indicated or by any other means which
they may consider suitable, with the repression of the Slave Trade;
each State in its respective possessions and under its own direction.
Whenever they consider it possible they will lend their
good offices to the Powers which, with a perfectly humanitarian
object, may be engaged in Africa upon a similar mission.





Article IV.

The Powers exercising sovereigrnty or Protectorate in Africa
may, however, delegate to Chartered Companies all or a portion of
the engagements which they assume in virtue of Article III. They
remain, nevertheless, directly responsible for the engagements
which they contract by the present General Act, and guarantee the
execution thereof.

The Powers promise to receive, aid, and protect national Associations
and enterprises due to private initiative which may wish
to co-operate in their possessions in the repression of the Slave
Trade, subject to their receiving previous authorization, which is
revocable at any time; subject also to their being directed and
controlled, and to the exclusion of any exercise of rights of sovereignty.





Article V.

The Contracting Powers undertake, unless this has already
been provided for by laws in accordance with the spirit of the
present Article, to enact or propose to their respective Legislatures,
in the course of one year at latest from the date of the signature
of the present General Act, a Law applying, on the one hand,
the provisions of their penal laws concerning grave offences against
the person, to the organizers and abettors of man-hunts, to perpetrators
of the mutilation of adults and male infants, and to all
persons who may take part in the capture of slaves by violence;
and, on the other hand, the provisions relating to offences against
individual liberty, to carriers, transporters, and dealers in slaves.

Accomplices and accessories of the different categories of slave
captors and dealers above specified shall be punished with penalties
proportionate to those incurred by the principals.

Guilty persons who may have escaped from the jurisdiction of
the authorities of the country where the crimes or offences have
been committed shall be arrested either on communication of the
incriminatory evidence by the authorities who have ascertained
the violation of the law, or on production of any other proof of
guilt by the Power on whose territory they may have been
discovered, and shall, without other formality, be held at the
disposal of the Tribunals competent to try them.

The Powers will communicate to each other, with the least
possible delay, the Laws or Decrees already in existence or promulgated
in execution of the present Article.





Article VI.

Slaves liberated in consequence of the stoppage or dispersal of
a convoy in the interior of the continent, shall be sent back, if
circumstances permit, to their country of origin; if not, the local
authorities shall help them as much as possible to obtain means of
subsistence, and, if they desire it, to settle on the spot. 





Article VII.

Any fugitive slave claiming on the continent the protection of
the Signatory Powers shall obtain it, and shall be received in the
camps and stations officially established by them, or on board
Government vessels plying on the lakes and rivers. Private stations
and vessels are only permitted to exercise the right of asylum subject
to the previous sanction of the State.





Article VIII.

The experience of all nations who have intercourse with Africa,
having shown the pernicious and preponderating part played by
fire-arms in Slave Trade operations, as well as in intestine wars
between native tribes; and this same experience having clearly
proved that the preservation of the African populations, whose
existence it is the express wish of the Powers to safeguard, is a
radical impossibility if restrictive measures against the trade in
fire-arms and ammunition are not established; the Powers decide,
in so far as the present state of their frontiers permits, that the
importation of fire-arms, and especially of rifles and improved
weapons, as well as of powder, balls, and cartridges, is, except in
the cases and under the conditions provided for in the following
Article, prohibited in the territories comprised between the
20th parallel of north latitude and the 22nd parallel of south
latitude, and extending westward to the Atlantic Ocean, and
eastward to the Indian Ocean and its dependencies, comprising
the islands adjacent to the coast as far as 100 nautical miles from
the shore.





Article IX.

The introduction of fire-arms and ammunition, when there
shall be occasion to authorize it in the possessions of the Signatory
Powers which exercise rights of sovereignty or of Protectorate in
Africa, shall be regulated in the following manner in the zone laid
clown in Article VIII, unless identical or more rigorous Regulations
have been already applied: —

All imported fire-arms shall be deposited, at the cost, risk, and
peril of the importers, in a public warehouse placed under the
control of the Administration of the State. No withdrawal of
fire-arms or imported ammunition shall take place from such warehouses
without the previous authorization of the Administration.
This authorization shall, except in cases hereinafter specified, be
refused for the withdrawal of all arms of precision, such as rifles,
magazine guns, or breech-loaders, whether whole or in detached
pieces, their cartridges, caps, or other ammunition intended for
them.

At the sea-ports the respective Governments may permit the
establishment of private warehouses, under conditions affording
the needful guarantees; but only for ordinary powder and flintlock
guns, and to the exclusion of improved arms and their ammunition.

Besides the measures directly taken by Governments for the
arming of the public force and the organization of their defence, individual
exceptions shall be admitted for persons affording sufficient
guarantees that the arm and ammunition delivered to them will
not be given, assigned, or sold to third persons, and for travellers
provided with a declaration of their Government stating that the
weapon and ammunition are destined exclusively for their personal
defence.

In the cases provided for in the preceding paragraph, all
arms shall be registered and marked by the authorities appointed
for the control, who shall deliver to the persons in question
licences to bear arms, indicating the name of the bearer and showing
the stamp with which the arm is marked. These licences are revocable
in case of proved abuse, and will be issued for five years
only, but may be renewed.

The rule above set forth as to warehousing shall also apply to
gunpowder.

Only flint-lock unrifled guns and common gunpowder, called
trade powder ("poudres de traite"), can be withdrawn from the
warehouses for purpose of sale. At each withdrawal of arms and
ammunition of this kind for sale, the local authorities shall determine
the regions in which these arms and ammunition may be sold.
The regions infected by the Slave Trade shall always be excluded.
Persons authorized to take arms or powder out of the warehouses
shall present to the Administration every six months detailed
lists indicating the destinations of the said fire-arms and powder
sold, as well as the quantities still remaining in store.





Article X.

The Governments shall take all measures they may deem
necessary to insure as complete a fulfilment as possible of the
provisions respecting the importation, sale, and transport of firearms
and ammunition, as well as to prevent either the entry or exit
thereof by their inland frontiers, or the conveyance thereof to regions
where the Slave Trade exists.

The authorization of transit within the limits of the zone
specified by Article VIII cannot be withheld when the arms and
ammunition are to pass across the territory of a Signatory or adherent
Power in the occupation of the coast, towards inland territories
placed under the sovereignty or Protectorate of another
Signatory or adherent Power, unless this latter Power have direct
access to the sea through its own territory. Nor, if this access be
completely interrupted, can the authorization of transit be withheld.
Any demand for transit must be accompanied by a declaration
emanating from the Government of the Power having the
inland possessions, and certifying that the said arms and ammunition
are not destined for sale, but are for the use of the authorities
of such Power, or of the military forces necessary for the protection
of the missionary or commercial stations, or of persons mentioned
by name in the Declaration. Nevertheless, the territorial Power
of the coast retains the right to stop, exceptionally and provisionally,
the transit of arms of precision and ammunition across its territory,
if, in consequence of inland disturbances or other serious danger,
there is ground for fearing that the dispatch of arms and ammunition might compromise
its own safety.





Article XI.

The Powers shall communicate to each other Information
relating to the traffic in fire-arms and ammunition, the licences
granted, and the measures of repression in force in their respective
territories.





Article XII.

The Powers undertake to adopt or to propose to their respective
legislatures the measures necessary to insure that those who infringe
the prohibitions laid down in Articles VIII and IX, and
their accomplices, shall, besides the seizure and confiscation of the
prohibited arms and ammunition, be punished either by fine or by
imprisonment, or by both penalties together, in proportion to the
importance of the offence, and in accordance with the gravity of
each case.





Article XIII.

The Signatory Powers who have possessions in Africa in contact
with the zone specified in Article VIII, bind themselves to take
the necessary measures for preventing the introduction of firearms
and ammunition across their inland frontiers into the regions
of the said zone, at least that of improved arms and cartridges.





Article XIV.

The system established under Articles VIII to XIII inclusive,
shall remain in force for twelve years. In case none of the Contracting
Parties shall have notified, twelve months before the expiration
of this period, their intention of putting an end to it, nor
shall have demanded its revision, it shall continue to remain obligatory
for two more years, and shall thus continue in force from two
years to two years.







Chapter II.

Caravan Routes and Land Transport of Slaves.



Article XV.

Independently of the repressive or protective action which
they exercise in the centres of the Slave Trade, the stations, cruisers,
and posts, the establishment of which is provided for in Article II,
and all other stations established or recognized according to the
terms of Article IV by each Government in its possessions, will
furthermore have the mission of watching, so far as circumstances
permit, and in proportion to the progress of their administrative
organization, the routes on their territory followed by the slavedealers,
of stopping the convoys on the march, and of pursuing
them wherever they can legally take action.





Article XVI.

In the regions of the coast known to serve habitually as places
of passage or terminal points for Slave Traffic coming from the
interior, as well as at the points of intersection of the principal
caravan routes crossing the zone contiguous to the coast already
subject to the influence of the Sovereign or Protecting Powers,
posts shall be established, under the conditions and with the
reservations mentioned in Article III, by the authorities responsible
for such territories, with the purpose of intercepting the
convoys and liberating the slaves.





Article XVII.

A strict supervision shall be organized by the local authorities
at the ports and in the countries adjacent to the coast, with the
view of preventing the sale and shipment of slaves brought from
the interior, as well as the formation and departure for the interior
of bands of man-hunters and slave-dealers.

Caravans arriving at the coast or its vicinity, as well as those
arriving in the interior at a locality occupied by the authorities of
the territorial Power, shall, on arrival, be submitted to a minute
inspection as to the persons composing them. Any individual
ascertained to have been captured or carried off by force or
mutilated, either in his native country or on the way, shall be
liberated.





Article XVIII.

In the possessions of each of the Contracting Powers the
Administration shall have the duty of protecting liberated slaves,
of repatriating them if possible, of procuring for them means of
subsistence, and, in particular, of providing for the education and
support of abandoned children.





Article XIX.

The penal arrangements provided for in Article V shall be
made applicable to all crimes or offences committed in the course
of operations for the transport of and traffic in slaves on land,
whenever proved.

Any person having incurred a penalty in consequence of an
offence provided for by the present General Act shall be under
the obligation of providing security before he is allowed to undertake
any commercial operation in countries where the Slave Trade
is carried on.







Chapter III.

Repression of the Slave Trade by Sea.

§ I. General Provisions.



Article XX.

The Signatory Powers acknowledge the opportuneness of taking
steps in common for the more effective repression of the Slave
Trade in the maritime zone in which it still exists.





Article XXI.

This zone extends, on the one hand, between the coasts of the
Indian Ocean (those of the Persian Gulf and of the Red Sea
included) from Beluchistan to Point Tangalane (Quilimane), and,
on the other hand, a conventional line which first follows the
meridian of Tangalane till it meets the 26th degree of south
latitude; is then merged in this parallel, then passes round tho
Island of Madagascar by the east, keeping 20 miles off the east
and north shore till it crosses the meridian of Cape Amber. From
this point the limit of the zone is determined by an oblique line
which extends to the coast of Beluchistan, passing 20 miles off
Cape Ras-el-Had.





Article XXII.

The Signatory Powers of the present General Act, between
whom there are special Conventions for the suppression of the
Slave Trade, have agreed to restrict to the above-mentioned zone

of visit, search, and detention ("droit de visite, de recherche, et de
saisie") of vessels at sea.





Article XXIII.

The same Powers have also agreed to limit the above-mentioned
right to vessels of less than 500 tons burthen.

This stipulation shall be revised as soon as experience shall

to bring about the discovery of persons taking part in Slave Trade
operations.

established at Zanzibar. The High Contracting Parties undertake
to forward to it all the documents specified in Article XLI, as well
as information of all kinds likely to assist in the suppression of the
Slave Trade.





Article XXVIII.

Any slave who may have taken refuge on board a ship of war
flying the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall be immediately
and definitively freed; such freedom, however, shall not withdraw
him from the competent jurisdiction, if he has committed a crime
or offence at common law.





Article XXIX.

Every slave detained against his wish on board a native vessel
shall have the right to claim his liberty.

His freedom may be declared by any Agent of one of the
Signatory Powers on whom the General Act confers the right of
ascertaining the status of persons on board such vessels; such
freedom, however, shall not withdraw him from the competent
jurisdiction if he has committed a crime or offence at common
law.

and Manifests of Black Passengers.





Article XXX.

carried on by such vessels.





Article XXXI.

The term "native vessel" applies to vessels fulfilling one of
the two following conditions: —

1. It must present the outward appearance of native build or
rig.

2. It must be manned by a crew of whom the captain and
the majority of the seamen belong by origin to a country having
a sea-coast on the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, or the Persian
Gulf.

fines to which they may eventually become liable.

3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the
vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and
especially that they have never been condemned for acts of Slave

It can at any time be suspended or withdrawn by the authorities
of the Power whose colours the vessel flies.

be provided with a distinctive mark.





Article XXXVI.

If the captain of a vessel should desire to embark negro passengers, he shall make
declaration thereof to the authority of the Power whose colours he flies, or, failing
such authority, to the territorial authority. The passengers shall be interrogated,
and after it has been ascertained that they embark of their own free will, they shall
be inscribed in a special manifest, bearing the description of each of them against

a native vessel, except at a place in which there is a resident authority belonging
to one of the High Contracting Powers, and unless such authority is present at the
landing.

Cases of force majeure which may have caused an infraction of these provisions shall
be examined by the authority of the Power whose colours the vessel flies, or, failing
such authority, by the territorial authority of the port at which the inculpated vessel
puts in.





Article XXXIX.

The provisions of Articles XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVII, and XXXVIII are not applicable to
vessels only partially decked, having a maximum crew of ten men, and satisfying one
of the two following conditions: —

vessels.





2. Detention of Suspected Vessels.





Article XLII.

When the officers in command of vessels of war of any of the Signatory Powers have

The present Article does not imply any change in the present state of things as regards
jurisdiction in territorial waters.





Article XLIII.
