30th September 1886

Sir

I have the honor to submit
to the Department the following concise 
report on the Trade and Commerce
of the Province of Angola, confining
myself more particularly to that part
of the province in the immediate
vicinity of the Capital, Loanda.

We are passing through
a crisis at present which for the
last two years has been very severely
felt and which recurs once in about
every ten or eleven years, consequent
on what may be termed a gradual 
rise

To the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington
D.C.



rise and fall in the rainy reasons.
During the year 1885 the rains were 
very light, and this year they have
been lighter still. The small rains
usually commence in September and
end the latter end of November or
beginning of December, and the heavy
rains commence in February and
end in the middle of May.

Such light rain falls have not 
been known for twenty years, but
we may now look for a gradual
increase in quantity up to the
year 1890, and again a gradual
diminution after that year until
a drought is again experienced.

These influences on agriculture
may be appreciated, and as the 
principal products of the country 
are



are vegetable, want of rain has
caused complete stagnation in
trade and commerce. Add to this
the very low prices Coffee, Oil, and 
Rubber have commanded in European
markets and the cause of the crisis is
plain

Exports. The exports are principally 
Coffee, rubber, palm oil,
cotton, rubber and bees-wax. The
most important however is coffee, a
large amount of capital being expended
in its growth. It is mostly exported
to Portugal and consequently gives employment 
to some Portuguese shipping.

But little of the produce of the 
Province is shipped to other countries. 
The total value of exports from
Loanda during 1885 was $897,930 0/00
as



as against $1,234,900 0/00 in 1884.

The following table shows countries 
to which produce was exported
with values.



Portugal
677,405


Holland
116,045


England
100,320


Portuguese possessions
4,160



$897,930 0/00



Imports. The imports are very varied
in description comprising textile fabrics,
earthenware, hardware, wines, flour,
timber, petroleum, Soap, Machinery.
Flour, timber, petroleum, and
soap are imported from the United
States. The following table shows
countries from which articles are
imported and values of same
for the year 1885.





England
$816,895 0/00


Portugal

France

United States

$1,193,750 0/00



We can calculate only on one
vessel a year from the states and
that vessel is the barque "Horace
Scudder" of Boston. She is loaded
by her owner with the articles
mentioned and sundries comprising
tar, lard, clocks, biscuits &amp;c.
She does not as a rule sell all her
cargo here. Timber as a rule,
sells readily but is by no means
a certain sale. Soap and petroleum 
also



also generally find a ready sale.
She takes from here drafts in payment,
and on reaching Gaboon
after calling at intermediate ports
buys red-wood and loads with
that and what ebony she can
get, for the States. She left here
early in the year and we may look
for her again in November or
December. As trade improves better
sales may be made, but not of some
goods, or qualities of goods that are
frequently sent here. The idea seems
to prevail that damaged and very
inferior goods are suitable enough
for this market. This is a mistake
and damages the reputation of 
the United States as a source of 
supply, and I have frequently 
complained



complained to captains and
supercargoes for so carelessly and
recklessly injuring the good names
and commercial reputation of
their country. I will substantiate
my remarks by giving my frequent
experience in one article, viz - flour.
A considerable quantity is brought
in United States vessels from time
to time, but is generally more or less
damaged, or of very inferior quality. 
The consequence is that instead of
finding a ready sale at good prices
it is with the utmost difficulty 
that purchasers can be found
for small quantities at low prices
and this is used to mix with
Portuguese flour in small quantities 
and to make very inferior
bread



bread which is used for convicts
and prisoner's rations.

Besides coffee a great quantity
of sugar cane is grown in the colony 
from which rum is distilled and is
an important article of domestic
trade, but little being imported
from other countries.

The differential duties make
direct trade with this province from 
other countries somewhat disadvantageous, 
principally however
to the shipping interest in most
cases. These duties operate as
follows: On goods manufactured 
in any other country than
Portugal and imported direct
from that country in other than
Portuguese vessels the whole amount



of duty according to the tariff is 
passable. If, being of foreign manufacture, 
they pass through the custom house in Lisbon and are reshipped 
thence in Portuguese Vessels
they pay 2% ad valorum in Lisbon
and 70% here, of the duty. If of
Portuguese manufacture and shipped
in Portuguese vessels, they pay 
only 2% in Lisbon and 30% here.

On the 28th of last month
the anniversary of the birth of the
Prince Royal of Portugal, the
inauguration of the West African
Telegraph Cable took place, and
on or about the 16th of this month
the Railway from Loanda to Ambaca 
will be inaugurated. The 
contractor for the construction of
the



the line is Mr John Burnay of
Lisbon and Oporto; The sub-contractor 
being Col: D. E. Davenport
an American, at present here, and
having offices at 2 Moorgate St.
London. He is daily expecting two
large vessels from the states with
material for construction, and I 
can see no reason why merchants
and manufactures in the states,
of such goods as will be required
not only in construction but in
the maintenance of the line, stations,
rolling stock and stores should
not compete for the furnishing
of same.

The agriculture of the country
is in the most primitive state still,
and only on coffee and sugar-cane
estates



estates is some attention paid
to improvements and even there
much more might be done.

A very enterprising missionary 
from the United States, Bishop
William Taylor arrived here some
two years ago with a few families 
and single people who are located
by the bishop in places chosen as
being suitable for farms and the
raising of live stock. He has got
out ploughs, materials for taming
and many other useful implements.
He not only expects to make these
stations self supporting but also
as schools for instructing the natives,
and teaching them farming, taming,
boat making, carpentering and
other industries and occupations.
I 



I have had intimate relations 
with him commercially
and as Vice Consul and have
been much struck at the great
energy displayed by a man
of his years, and the faith
he has in his enterprises.

It is sincerely to be hoped that
the ultimate results may be
as successful as the venerable,
energetic and devoutly christian
promoter and leader both
desires and deserves.

I have the honour to be
Sir
Your most obedient servant
Robt S. Newton
Vice Consul
