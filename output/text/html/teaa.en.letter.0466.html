Commercial Agency of the United States,
Kongo Free State, â€ŽKinshassa, Stanley Pool
Oct 5th 1892

Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform you 
that I have arrived at Stanley
Pool on my way to the interior
of the Kongo Free State, having
left Matadi August 29th with 
a caravan of one hundred and 
four men.

I shall leave this place Oct 13th
for Loulouabourg on the Kassai
River distant eight hundred and 
seventy five miles, and shall be 
back at the Pool probably 
next June. I shall next visit the 
Oubanghi River, and hope to arrive 
at Stanley Falls this time
next year. From the Falls I shall
go to the Eastern Boundary of this



this state which is Lake Tanganyika
upon arrived at Tanganyika I shall
devote several months to the Katanga 
Country, and if I find communication
with the Kongo River cut off
shall go with an Arab caravan to 
Bagamayo on the East Coast  
Zanzibar, as the most 
expeditious, and safest route
out.

As far as possible I shall keep 
the Department informed of my 
moments, but as mail communication 
in the interior is not good
long lapses must occur in my
correspondence.

My Report on the Lower and 
Upper Kongo will be submitted
upon completion of the work 
assigned me.

I am, Sir, 
Respectfully
R. Dorsey Mohun
Commercial Agent
Kongo Free State
