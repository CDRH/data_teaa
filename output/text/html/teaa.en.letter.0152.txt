To Honoble. J. C. Bancroft Davis
Asst. Secty of State
Washington D.C.


Sir

I have the honor to state that I have
just received a letter dated Bailundu S.W.
Africa signed Francis O. Nichols secty. of 
the Am: Mission in which he states that
he and all his friends there are well and 
enjoying good health, also that the country 
is very beautiful, fertile and healthy, and 
the natives very kind, beside abundant 
game.

The Portuguese authorities agree with Mr.
Nichols statement, and told me about
that country few weeks ago.

I have the honor to be Sir
Respectfully
Your obedient servant
L de R du Verge
US Consul.
