Analysis

Most Americans did not have access to Congressional debates about whether the U.S
should recognize the sovereignty of King Leopold II of Belgium's Congo Free State—which
prompted the convening of the Berlin Conference—or discussions of U.S. engagement
with the "African Question."1 They turned to newspapers to glean any information about
the major international issue for the West at the time—the present and future state
of African affairs. U.S. media coverage of the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 was extensive,
with articles published in the major coastal newspapers and dailies in the South,
West, and Midwest, attesting to the scope of American interest in European designs
on Africa.
