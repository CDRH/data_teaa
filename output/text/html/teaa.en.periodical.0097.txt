Listen, O Isles!*

[An appreciation of the Philippine Constabulary Band, organized by a Negro, Captain
Loving, through the suggestion of former President Taft.]

I.


Swirled overmost by Titan winds that toss
Their limbs and ringlets in the eddying air,
Like death-loosed poets, with their breeze-blown 
hair,
Hymning to mountains, precipice and palm,
Or sighing soft as Seraph's evening psalm—
Startled by storm burst; stilled in love's 
deep loss,
Listen, O Dream Isles of the Orient Main,
Thy brown elves wake and pour lost Eden's
choral strain!


II.


Thrilled by brown magi from the nymphean
coves
Old nations sing as if the centuries
Sighed to the stars some old, lost planet's
love;
Now Egypt breathes; now Babylon, Persia,
Greece,
Through these soft pipes, wake, sighing, like
the groves
Where gods have wandered, and where winds
are whispering "Peace."
But hear the flute's sweet eccentricities
'Neath the white moon, yon castled stream
above,
Till crash of cymbals, turban'd Turks have
known,
And sound's fine rain, and booming of deep
drums,
(And the brown gnome who pursueth wind
gusts through
Old Triton's wreathèd shell, he wakes anew—
Bellowing, like Neptune's rage, with much
ado),
Drown, with their ocean roar, the little bird
Whose notes, like dainty Ariel's, laughed
that they were heard.
Waas it Adonis, wandering alone,
Waked, with sweet lips, the silver piccolo,
Fair Music's nightingale, which sang: "Mine
own,
Mine own, dear Love, dost thou not know; not know?"
Now, o'er the hills, is it Apollo comes,
Pouring (oh, hear!) sound's golden honey
down
The Helicon? But hark! What mellow tide
could drown
Those silver reeds whose notes go down to
some
Well's bottom, over crystal rocks? Oh,
come!
Hear music ripple, like a breeze that's 
blown
O'er ripening fields and Daphne's rosy vale,
Full, deep and resonant! Hear this rose
gale
Of June's sweet Calliope wake, and all
The muses rouse from dreamy murmurings!
Hear shout and revel; romp and tipsy call
Of woodland fairies. List! What siren
sings
O'er ocean voicings—deep, divinely deep!
What billowed temptests rage; what surge
and sweep;
What equal thunderings storm Poseidon's
throne,
And sound Earth's  black abyss!
Now Ares fires
The clouds, and far his awful symphony fills
The world. 'Tis war! Embattled Harmony
Sends Echo flying, golden, to the hills,
To win brave heights where the winged eagle
tires.
And oh! the battle music rageth gloriously!
Till, victory won, a last loud bar begins
With roll of kettledrums, like boom of bees
that drone,
On heavy wings, down sultry summer
winds,
And unmolested bays where love sees one
white sail.


III.


And what of him who leads these happy
fauns?
This Afric' Pan who broke the crystal lip
Of Sound's lost river; plashed there, and
let drip
Thy soul, O Islands, mystical and sweet,
Through reeds that bowed and nodded at
Taft's feet,
Fair and unbroken, 'mid the clamorous
Dawn's
Cry and appealings? Courage, O my race!
Courage and patience, Islands; ye shall
yet have place!
