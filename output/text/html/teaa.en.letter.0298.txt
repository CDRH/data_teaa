U.S. Comcl Agency
Gaboon Jany 3d 1866.

To the Hon. Wm H. Seward,
Secretary of State,
Washington D.C.

Sir: I have
the honor to acknowledge, since my last, the receipt,
from the Dep. of State, of despatch No 14, requesting 
me to continue to act as Vice Comcl Agt &amp;c., 
proclamation of president Johnson in relation to 
N. Carolina, Circular in relation to the Am.
Geo. and State Soc. N.Y. and a copy of "List of 
Diplomatic &amp; Consular offices &amp;c."

I reply to note on page 2 of said "List," that
the "Manual" here, was printed at "Washington, 1863."

To note on page 54, I reply that "Gaboon"
is erroneously put, on page 10, among "Portuguese
dominions." It should be among French 
on page 9. 



I have no arrivals of vessels to report 
during the past six months, nor any fees.

During the year 1865 only two 
American vessels (barks) have entered this port.

There is no material change in
the trade. The articles of export (Ivory and 
Barwood) are becoming yearly scarcer &amp;
dearer; and year by year subject to 
more &amp; more  competition.

I have the honor to be, Sir, your obt servt
J. M. Preston
Vice Comcl Agent.
