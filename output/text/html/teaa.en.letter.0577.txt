No. 20

Consulate of the United States,
St Paul de Loanda, Febr. 13, 1892.

Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

Since New-Year the political condition
has remained unchanged.

Every by-weekly steamer continues to
bring some 20-50 tramps and criminals
sent by the Portuguese government to colonize
West Africa. Many die, a few manage
to go home at the expense of charitable people
or captains, the rest settles down to work, and
tries to make a living.

The telegraphic news, about middle of
January, of the change of Government in 
Portugal has quieted the spirits and given 
new hopes to the democratic patriots.
The present minister of Colonies, his secretary
and the secretary of the Minister of Foreign
affairs are almost Loanda-people, having
been here so long, and two of the being married



to white natives of this city.

In order to get over her financial crisis,
Portugal must find money somewhere, and 
the pawning or the selling of some of her Colonies 
is inevitable. I know from personal
friends in ruling circles from the conversation
of the people, and frequent hints of the press
of all colors, that while the sales of colonies 
to England, France or Germany would be strongly
objected to by the people, the pawning or sale 
of Macao, or the Azores, or the Cape-Verde
Islands or Kabinda (near mouth of Congo),
all strategic points of unsupposable importance 
for our navy and our commerce
of the future, to the United States, would 
be viewed with favor, yea hailed with joy,
by the majority of the people.

I can't help drawing again the attention
of the Department even at the risk of appearing 
impertinent, to this unique chance
of securing one, a few, or all of those
splendid ports.

I have the honor to be, Sir
Your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
