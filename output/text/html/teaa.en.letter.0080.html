United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda June 30th 1867.

Sir

I have the honor to enclose herewith 
Form No 14.

I have made up the accounts of 
this Commercial Agency for the 
quarter ending this day, and forward 
them by this opportunity to the Honorable 
Secretary of the Treasury and 
Fifth Auditor in accordance with 
Consular Instructions.

My account current forwarded 
to the Fifth Auditor shows a balance 
in my favor of $214.02, for 
which amount I have drawn on 
the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury.

Form No 14, for quarter ending 
this day, shows a slight increase 
of American Trade, over recent quarters. 
In former years, previous to the 
war


The Honorable Wm H. Seward
Secretary of State




war, the importations from the 
United States to this port, were very large 
and continually on the increase 
unfortunately our domestic difficulties 
prevented the importation 
of Cotton goods from the United 
States, on account of their high 
cost. Coast traders were obliged 
to seek theirs in England, and 
thus British commerce has increased 
to the disadvantage of American 
Previous to the war, scarcely a British 
Vessel visited this port, now there 
are seldom less than from three to
five, in the harbour. The principal 
cotton goods imported from England 
are imitations of American fabrics 
and many qualities of American 
goods would now be preferred, if 
they could compete in price with 
British Manufactures, America in 
former years, found a large market 
for produce. in fact, for twenty years 
they monopolised the entire trade now 
the



the articles are imported in quantity 
from England.

The present trade between this 
port and Boston and New York is 
chiefly confined to rum, which forms 
at least three quarters of every vessels 
cargo, American Rum has the preference 
as this market over that of 
any other country. The consumption 
is about 4000 pipes per annum.
About 1000 pipes are imported from the 
United States which sells at about 
40 to 50 cents a gallon in bond, in 
exchange for Palm Oil, at about 40 
cents a gallon, shelled Pea Nuts 
at 3 cents per pound. Angola Gum 
Copal &amp; Benguela picked gum, 15 
cents per pound, Hides 8 cents per 
pound, Fish oil 40 cents a gallon
Coffee 13 cents a pound. Vessels of 
300 tons are usually about four months 
in negociating a homeward cargo the 
port charges for a vessel of this size 
are about 80 dollars each time 
Freights



Freights to England are about 
£3 per ton, and Exchange, three 
months bills 2½% discount.

I am collecting information to 
enable me to make out an elaborate 
report of the trade done on 
this coast, in which report I 
shall include the Congo River, and 
Vicinity which place has increased 
very rapidly in commercial importance, 
since slaves ceased to be 
shipped from there, so as to elicit 
the admiration of all advocates of 
Freedom.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your Most Obedt Servt
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
