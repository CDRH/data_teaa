No. 12

Commercial Agency of the United States,
Boma, Congo State, August 5th 1889
(Written at Culpeper Virginia)

Honorable Wm F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

There are certain citizens
of the United States now on the 
Congo River. Missionaries,
belonging to a "Faith Cure Sect,"
Who, I fear, may become destitutes,
Without means to return home.

As will be seen by
my despatch No 11, these people
are now in anything but a 
prosperous condition. And as
the members of this same mission
in /85 or /86, were thrown upon 
the charity of the English Baptists,
and by that society provided
with passages to Europe,
I, anticipating their coming to 
me for relief, respectfully



ask instructions from the 
Department as to what action
I am authorized to take in 
the matter. I am Sir:
Your Obedient Servant
Emory H. Taunt
U.S. Com. Agent Boma
