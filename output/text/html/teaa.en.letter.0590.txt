No. 31

Consulate of the United States,
Loanda, June 29, 1892

Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

Six weeks ago a partner of Newton,
Carnegie &amp; Co. showed me in a clipping from 
an English paper a Washington telegram
purporting that Congress had for the current
fiscal year reduced the income of this
Consulate, as that of other minor ones in
Africa, to the fees.

At the same time I was advised 
not to be such a fool as to stay in Loanda
spending money for a government that ceased 
to support me.

There being a probability of retrenchment
in the budget of this Congress, I somewhat 
expected that my salary would be
stopped after the June quarter, and realizing
the impossibility of my continuing long to
be Consul without any support; was awaiting



the official announcement of the reduction, in
order to tender my resignation, and shut up
this Consular officer, for without remuneration
as English-speaking person would take it, 
as, however, the official advice of the curtailment 
has not yet come, nor do American
papers confirm that news, I have begun to
doubt its correctness.

Still, as this question has set me a-thinking,
I have come to the conclusion that,
whether the salary be continued or not, its 
would only be just, in presence of the peculiar 
circumstances of this port, of the Department
would assume the expense of office-rent,
not to exceed 7 dollars per month. This 
is the request I now respectfully submit
to your decision.

Considering further the fact, that I am
not engaged in business and give all my 
time to the collection and distribution of non-paying, 
yet highly useful, information on
this vast Consular district, an appropriate
increase of salary, which would per se settle
the office question, would appear yet more
just, and ensure the better standing of this
post.

I am, Sir, your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Coml Agent
