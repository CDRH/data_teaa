United States Commercial
Agency at Gaboon 
November 11th 1876

Hon Hamilton Fish 
Secretary of State 
Washington D.C.

Sir,

We, the undersigned, Commercial 
Agent, and Vice Commercial 
Agent, at this port; desire 
to express are deep regret, at the
discontinuance of the Commercial 
Agency, and the removal 
of our beloved flag from Gaboon,
where its influence has been so 
beneficial, to both American,
and African interests.

Supposing that the lack of 
salary for the Agent, was the
cause of its discontinuance, we
respectfully solict, from His 
Excellency the President, its resumption;
with permission for us to discharge
the functions of the office
without salary; receiving only 



here for out review.

Hoping to receive a reply to 
our request, at the earliest 
practicable moment; before 
an opportunity shall offer, for 
sending the archives to
the United States;

We have the honor to be 
Sir;
Most Respectfully 
Your obedient Servants
Albert Bushnell
Joseph H. Reading
