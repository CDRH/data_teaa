Your Excellency,

In view of the friendly relation
which exists between the two Governments, I take
the liberty of laying before you in a few words, the
state of affairs which recently took place here.

You are well aware that the Government
of the French Republic a short time ago
sent out a Plenipotentiary in the person of Mr.
Le Myre de Vilers, late Resident General for Madagascar,
with a special mission, which we
hailed with the greatest pleasure, having taken
it for granted that the object of his mission
was to put aright the disorderly state of things
created by the highhanded and illegal proceedings
taken by the French element, notably those
in the service of the Residence General. We
regret, however, to observe here, that we were 
disappointed in the way the Plenipotentiary carried
on his mission, for he acted on the advice of the above
said people who are notoriously known for many
years past as seeking nothing else but the embark
France

To His Excellency
The Secretary of State of the United States
Washington



France into an intricate complication with
Madagascar, and so broke diplomatic relation with
Her Majesty's Government.

I have consequently the honour to forward 
herewith for Your Excellency's perusal copy of the 
Red Book just published by the Malagasy Government
on the question at issue.

Finally, Your Excellency will allow me
to remark that after a careful study of the twelve
articles of the contre-projet addressed to the Plenipotentiary
of the French Republic, page 14 in
The Red Book, you will clearly see what a great
desire Her Majesty's Government has to avoid
any complications whatsoever with the Government
of the Republic, to maintain a friendly relation
with France and to have a full and uninterrupted
scope to do all that will tend to
forward the progress and prosperity of our
Country.

May God bless Your Excellency
Saith your friend
(signed) Rainilaiarivony
Prime Minister
