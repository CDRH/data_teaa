No. 7

Consulate of the United States,
at St. Paul de Loanda Vineland, N.J. 29 April 1891.

Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

To avoid confusion in my plan of work, I should
know before setting what the limits of the Commercial
Agency of St. Paul de Loanda are. According to
paragraph 30 of the Consular Regulation I understand
them to embrace all of the two Provinces of (a) Angola
(b) S. Thom√© and Principe; for the latter is nearer
Loanda then San Tiago, the next northern U.S.
Consulate in Portuguese territory.

As I can judge from the progress of 
my book on Angolan Legends, I shall be 
able to sail by end of June or first part
of July.

I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Heli Chatalain
appointed U.S. Commercial Agent, Loanda
