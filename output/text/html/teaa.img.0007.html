  <p>This photograph was taken in 1906, capturing three sentries with a prisoner in Lokongia, Congo. It accompanies an article that recounts the history of the International African Association, which was the precursor to the Congo Free State. Using biting sarcasm, the author explains that King Leopold, aided by the American immigrant Henry Morton Stanley, had convinced European leaders and the United States that his mission was benevolent, aimed at "moral and material regeneration" of the Congolese peoples. In reality, he set up a regime of coerced labor enforced by both the Force Publique and African sentries hired to guard African prisoners. It is not clear from the photo what crime the prisoner committed. However, the "free state" authorities were known to imprison and mutilate African workers for refusing to work or for not meeting their rubber quota. <em>The Voice of the Negro</em>, founded by John W. E. Bowen, Sr., and Jesse Max Barber in Atlanta in 1904, sought to bring national and international news to its African American readers. Like other Black periodicals, as well as mainstream newspapers, the atrocities committed in the Congo Free State and the work of the American branch of the Congo Reform Association to usher in a "benevolent" colonial government over the area captured the attention of many Americans.</p>
