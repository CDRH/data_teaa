No. 18

United States Commercial Agency
St. Paul de Loanda Novr 30th 1865

Sir;

I have the honor to enclose Form No. 14.

I have made up the accounts of the Agency for
the Quarter ending September 30th 1865, and forward them by
this opportunity, to the Hon Secretary of the Treasury and
Fifth Auditor, in accordance with Consular Instructions.

My account current to the Fifth Auditor shows a
balance in my favor of $240.45. for which amount under
date of September 30th, I have shown on the Hon Secretary
of the Treasury.

There is every prospect that American
Commerce will soon return to this Consul. The Barque
"William M. Shailer," reported in Form No 14 is one
of

Hon William H. Seward
Secretary of State
Washington
D.C.



of the many vessels who frequented this Coast, previous to
the Rebellion and I understood she will be followed by
others.

Despatches, No 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6 respectively, from the
Department, have been received at this Agency, as well as
the President's proclamation of May 10th, 22nd and 29th
and also June 15th, together with Circular of June 2nd
and Consular and Diplomatic list of July of the 
present year.

I take the liberty of reminding the Department
of my request to create this Commercial Agency to
a Consulate, with permission to trade, as I have seen
recently, during the case of Baxter the urgent necessity
of so doing.

I have the Honor
To be
Your most obdt Servant.
Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent
