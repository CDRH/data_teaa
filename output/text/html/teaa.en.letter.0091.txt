United States Consulate at S' Thome and Prince's, West Africa
St Thome March the 29th 1870

Honoble Sir,

The continuos fevers of
the African Coast have not allowed me
so far to send the report of the trade of the
Province, as reccomended by the Consular Regulations
I will do so however as soon as I am able, and I
hope that will be sometime next month. I will
also send by the same mail a draft for authorized
expenses, such as relief of destitute seamen,
freight on parcels from Lisbon,  
etc, amounting in all to somewhere about 50
Dollars more or less.

I have to aknowledge the receipt of Coat of Arms
Commercial Relations, and Diplomatic Correspondence
part 1th and 2d 1868. I must beg to remind the 
Department that as yet I have not received any
book containing the Treaty, between the United States
and Portugal, and that I think it would
be advisable to send it, as well as a letter press
and Books and Blanks, for the use of this Consulate.
There has been a new tariff published



here, but not to go in operation. I believe
untill the first of August next. I have not had
time yet to look it all over, but as far as I have
seen, it is somewhat more moderate than the one
in force now, and has the advantage of putting foreign
vessels, on a par with Portuguese, regarding goods
of foreign growth, or manufacture This ought to encourage
American Vessels to come back to this Province
and trade. The Rotterdam house of Kerdyke and Pinkoff 
have just opened a branch here in St Thomas
and in time opening another in Prince's, with very fine
prospects. I don't see any reason, why enterprising Americans
should not do the same to a good advantage.
Formerly the American trade in these Islands was
of considerable importance, and apparently on the increase.
Our domestic difficulties, and the high import duties 
charged here, have put a stop to a trade that ought
to have been very profitable to all parties. To wich
may be added the low price that the St Thom√© coffee,
really a very good kind, fetches in the states. The coffee
is bought here now for cash, at about 5 cent p pound
subject to export duties (about 3/4 of a cent a pound both
in Portuguese and Foreign vessels. This is about also
the Price of cocoa, with a lower duty however, a fraction 
less than 1/2 cent a pound. The Port charges are moderate, and



the Custom's House authorities very obliging. The
Prices of both coffee and cocoa are such, that a
good profit could be made, on both articles of produce.
No large trade however could be done, but it
could be reasonably expected, that it would increase
yearly. The Exportation of this Island for the 
year 1860 at this market price amounted in round
numbers to $200,000 and The Importation to about
$170,000. In Prince's Island (within 70 miles distance) Importations
amounted to $40,000, and the Exportation
to about $20,000. This year (1869) will probably be the same.
With the influence of trading vessels, these numbers
would steadily increase. The only chances to
import or export now are through the monthly line
of steamers, whose high rates of freight, added to
the frightfull overcharges of the Portuguese Consignee's
in Lisbon, take about 50/00 from the
Profits that the traders would be making.

Hoping these few remark's on
the trade of this province will be acceptable 
I have the honor to remain with the greatest
consideration

Your Most Rest and Obet Servant
D. L. Marsins
Consul.
