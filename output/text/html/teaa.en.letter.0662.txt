United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda
3 May 1884.

Sir

I am advised of the non-payment of the
two Bills No 7 $350 and No 8 for $174 drawn
in my favor by Consul Du Verge on the Secretary
of the Treasury on the ground that he was in a 
condition not responsible for his actions at the
time of signing.

I beg to enclose copy of a despatch I
find has been inserted in the Official Correspondence
Book by Mr Du Verge advising the drawing
of one of these bills.

These Bills were sent to me by Mr Du Verge
from Banana in a letter of which I have the 
honor to transmit a copy.

While Mr Du Verge was in the Congo he
ordered in his capacity as chief of the Station at
Vivi, of the Belgians Association. Several articles which
were charged to him and as it will be seen by the
enclosed Copy of Account, there remained a Balance
after payment of his Bills, which I did not for a  
moment doubt, due to him of Â£30:2:4 for which 
I remitted to him, by the packet of the 15th of last
month



month a Bill on my Agents. The payment of that
Bill I have ordered to be stopped in the usual way
until further reasons are given for the non-payment 
of the said two Bills by the Secretary 
of the Treasury.

There will I venture to believe be very
little doubt in your mind that the allegation
set forth by Mr Du Verge is a vile invention to
serve his own ends and an act inconsistent with
integrity and honesty. If therefore Mr Du Verge
cannot be called upon by the Government to make
good the Amount he is now indebted to me I 
shall be under the painful necessity of prosecuting 
him by law

I may state that there are several persons
residents in this city who saw Mr Du Verge at
Banana in the Congo previous to his departure
for Europe as well as the Captain of the Steamer
in which he took passage could state that he 
did not appear to be in any way irresponsible
for his acts.

I have the honor to be 
Sir
Your most Obedient Servant
Robt S Newton
U.S. Vice Consul

To the 
Assistant Secretary of State
