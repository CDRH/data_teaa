Legation of Liberia,
Yonkers, N.Y. Jany 11th 1867

Sir

It having been ascertained that
there is no suitable sailing vessel in the United
States Navy, nor any suitable steam vessel that
can (in the judgment of the Secry of the Navy)
be spared for the purpose of being transferred to
the Government of Liberia, according to the late act
of Congress, their liberal act towards Liberia cannot
be mad available; of this fact the Liberian Government
was not yet, at last dates, apprised;
while, in addition to former pressing reasons for
desiring it, another still more imminent has
arisen.

The Government has information
that the several tribes along the sea board

To the Honble William H. Seward
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.



being dissatisfied with the interference of
"Port of Entry" laws with trade with foreign
vessels on the coast, have concerted plans
for attacking and carrying by force of
arms, and starvation, Sinou and Bassa
Counties, (about two thirds of all the Liberian
coast). And the government of 
Liberia, not yet aware of the disappointment,
which next mail, probably ere this,
has brought them, instructs me, that it is
urgently necessary, that the gun Boat should
be there as early as possible; and to put
forth all my endeavours that no time
may be lost.

Under these circumstances may I 
ask if the United States Government will
extend to Liberia the assistance of one
of her cruizers on that coast.

I have the honor to be with the highest
consideration Sir your most obedient Servant
H. M. Schieffelin
