Department of State Received Jan 11 1887

158 Water Street
New York, Jan'y 10th 18861887

To the Hon.
Secretary of State.
Washington D.C.

Sir,

I had the honor to address
you on the 15th August 86 from
Zanzibar asking an allowance
of $500 for making a treaty with
the Sultan. On the 28th Feb. 86 you
replied that there was no authority
of law to make an allowance

I had hoped as the claim was just 
something would be allowed me. I went
to considerable expense to get the treaty
through quickly which I could not
afford out of $1000 per annum salary.

The climate of Zanzibar is a very
trying one for whitemen and my
health has been impaired by a residence
there. I take the liberty to ask of the
Hon. Secretary that some consideration
of my care will be taken.

I have the honor to be Sir,
Your obedient servant
F. M. Cheney
Late U.S. Consul Zanzibar
