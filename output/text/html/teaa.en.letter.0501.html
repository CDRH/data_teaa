Hon. G. L. Rives
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
the department that on my departure 
from my Consular district to visit the
United States on leave, because of the
absence of Vice Consul Newton at Madeira.
I was forced to entrust Mr Julius L. Judson
with the property of the United States
in any charge and he trusting that 
my recommendation for his appointment
as Acting U.S. Vice Consul would be
favorably acted upon is now performing 
the duties of the office and when 
so instructed will forward to the
department his bond.

Mr Judson is a citizen of the
United States, a graduate of one of our
colleges and a man of intelligence and
proberty and is worthy if the favorable
consideration of the department.

I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obedient servant
Henry F. Downing
U.S. Consul
