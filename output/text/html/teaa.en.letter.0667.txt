Master's department on vessels
Constructed here are as follows;

On vessels constructed out of the
port, 10% on the total cost of
the vessel. This is intended to
equalize the imports as constructors 
here have to pay duties on 
the



the materials imported and
used in construction.

The tonage for this import is
