Hon. William H. Seward
Secretary of State 
Washington D.C.

Dear Sir

I would beg to state that the trade 
between the United States and this port is very 
limited. During the past year there has been 
but three American vessels in this river. These 
belonged to a single firm in the City of
New York. There has been no consular books 
kept in this place, but according to my best 
information there has not been more than 
three American vessels here during any one 
year for the past three years. I know of no 
American vessel expected here at present.
The trade of this river is princefly in the hands 
of the English. The exports from this part during 
the past year were, of Ivory 25 tons;
Bonwood 2000 tons,, Rubber 125 tons also 
small quantities of Bees-Wax, Gum-Copel
and Ebony. The American trade at this 
port since my arrival (3d November 1862) has 
not exceeded $1200;

I am sir with much respect
your most obedient servant 
Henry May
U S Comml Agt
