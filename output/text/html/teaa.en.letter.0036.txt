United States Commercial Agency
at Loanda 30th June 1862

Sir

I have the honor to inform 
you that Silas Andrews Esq the
newly appointed Commercial Agent 
has not yet arrived. In 
consequence of this Gentlemans 
non-arrival I beg to solicit the 
appointment as Vice Commercial 
Agent so as to enable me to be
officially acknowledged by the 
Government of His Most Faithful 
Majesty, which I have not as
yet been.

By the non-appearance here 
of the Commercial Agent I still 
hold the office as Acting, it 
therefore would be very necessary to
be informed, whether the above 
named Gentleman has taken the 
office


The Honble
W. H. Seward
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c 





office to which he is appointed 
and of his intentions in coming

Very respectfully
Your Obdt Servant
Robert Cunningham
