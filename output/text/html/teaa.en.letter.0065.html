On the 7th inst. I received an invitation
from one of the Chief Justices of the
City to assist, as witness, the sealing
up of the Brazilian Consular Archives
in few hours after the death of the
Acting Brazilian Consul of this City. I
found the Judge with two Brazilian
Gentlemen perusing and commenting upon
the Brazilian Consular Regulations. My
attention was called to an article of the
Regulations wherein it was written
that whenever a Brazilian Consul
should


Hon William H. Seward
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.




should die, it was requested of the
competent Authority to cull together two
Brazilian subjects and a Consul of some
friendly nation, to witness the sealing
up of the Archives and to invite said
Consular Officer to take charge of
the duties of the Brazilian Consulate
until His Imperial Majesty should
be pleased to fill the vacancy.

I considered it my duty
under the circumstances to cheerfully
accept the duty thus assigned to me
and in my Despatch to His Excellency
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil
copy of which I herewith enclose; I
say to His Excellency that I am
moved with pride as the Representative
of the United States in this country to



have it in my power to be of service
to this friendly Empire of Brazil.
I also addressed His Excellency the
Governor General of the Province on
the subject copy of which I have
also the honor to enclose.

I am confident the Department
will approve of my proceedings
in this case founded as I
suppose they are, upon the correct
principle of International Courtesy.

I have the honor

Sir

It devolves upon me the unpleasant 
duty to inform Your Excellency of the

Nation in this City which took place 
on the 7th of the present month.

In compliance with an 
invitation received from Dr Carlos Pacheco
de Bettencourt "Juiz de Direito" (Chief Justice) of
this District. I assisted the sealing of
the Archives, and accepted the invitation 
to assume charge of the duties of the 
Brazilian


His Excellency
The Minister of Foreign Affairs
Empire of Brazil




Brazilian Consulate until it should please
Your Excellency to appoint another to fill 
the office: "The Juiz de Direito" pointed out
to me, the Brazilian Consular Regulation, 
previous to sealing the Archives, wherein it 
requested that in case of death of Brazilian 
Consular Officer, the duties of the Consulate 
by  should be given to a foreign 
Consular Officer, whose nation was on 
friendly terms with Brazil: I had the 
privilege to have this honor offered to me, 
and in accepting the responsibility, I am 
moved with pride, as the representative of 
the United States in this City, to have it 
in my power to be of service to the friendly 
Empire of Brazil.

Considering myself, under
the circumstances, fully empowered by the



"Juiz de Direito", to act on behalf of Brazilian
interest, in this Province; I have this day
sent a note to His Excellency the Govenor 
General of the Province, informing him of 
the fact for his Government: I have the 
honor to enclose a copy of this note and 
His Excellency's reply, and also a "Public 
Instrument" of the "Aide de Deligencia" 
drawn up by the "Juiz de Direito" soon after 
Mr Ramizo Luis de Santos expired, signed by 
several Brazilian witnesses and others, including 
myself, wherein is also stated the 
Authority which confers upon me the 
honor to address Your Excellency.

Not having in my possession
the Archives of the Brazilian Consulate for 
reference and information. I may not 
carry out exactly the wishes of the 



Brazilian Government, but nevertheless 
will endeavour, guided by the Consular 
Regulations of the United States to protect 
the interests of your nation and arm of 
its subjects requiring assistance.

A copy of this Despatch 
I have considered proper to send to His 
Excellency the Brazilian Minister at 
Lisbon, that he may inform Snr Manoel
Sobral Pinto of the circumstances who I 
understand still holds His Imperial 
Majesty's Commission as Consul for 
the Empire of Brazil in this City.

With the assurance of my 
highest respect.
