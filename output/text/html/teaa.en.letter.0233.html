Department of State Received Aug 8 1887
No. 11

United States Consulate
Zanzibar, July 4, 1887

To the Hon.
Third Assit Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:

I have the honor to inform
you that this the 111th Anniversary
of the Declaration of
the Independence of the United
States of America has been 
observed in a becoming manner
at this port.

All of the European
Consuls have honored the
occasion by paying an
official visit to this Consulate.

H. B. M. Ships "Turquoise"
and



and "Reindeer" (the only foreign
men o'war in port) are decked
out with the American Ensign 
at the main. As also are the
ships of His Majesty the
Sultan of Zanzibar.

A royal salute of
twenty-one guns was fired
at noon from His Majesty's
Man o'war "Glasgow".

This evening a dinner will
be given at the Consulate,
to which all of 
the Americans are invited.

A marked event of 
the day has been the throwing
to the breeze of the large
American Ensign from the
new staff, which was only
yesterday



yesterday erected over this 
Consulate.

I have anticipated the
permission of the Department
in respect to the Flag-staff
and trust that I may be
pardoned in so doing: since
it did not seem fitting
that the flag should be flying
from a make-shift
staff on our great-national
holiday

I await the sanction of
the Department before presenting
accounts for the same.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant
Seth A. Pratt.
U.S. Consul
