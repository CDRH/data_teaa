Sir,

I have the honor to acknowledge, with 
thanks, a copy of the "Finance Report. 1870"
also, to send herewith, some fac-simile copies
of a letter from the King of Musadu to the
President of Liberia, written in Arabic, which
is believed to be the only language and character
in use for written communications, accross the
entire continent of Africa.

I have the honor to be, with the highest
consideration, Sir, Your obedient servant.
