  <p><em>Crisis</em> magazine featured King Daudi Chua in its "Men of the Month" section. The reader learns from the accompanying article that King Chua rules over some 4 million "black folk" over "a territory as large as New England, New York, and Pennsylvania combined." The article highlights the youthfulness of the ruler, referring to him as "a black boy who is king." The photo includes King Chua, two regents, and four Englishmen in official British garb. This was not the first time that an American periodical made mention of the ruler. In 1905, <em>The Washington Post</em> reprinted an article about him featured in <em>Everybody's Magazine</em>, which mocked his sitting on a scarlet throne at age 8 under the British Protectorate. Duadi Chua ascended to the kingship as an infant in 1897, when the British defeated his father King Mwanga II and he fled the kingdom. <em>Crisis</em> made concerted efforts to bring African history and figures to the attention of its readers, often highlighting kings, queens, and other rules whose presence refuted white supremacist claims of Black/African inferiority. The article speculates that ancient Egyptian civilization may have originated here and then "spread down the Nile," or that civilization spread southward to Uganda. Whichever scenario, the magazine describes King Chua and other Central Africans as "the Egyptian type in black faces."</p>
