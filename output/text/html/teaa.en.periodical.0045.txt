Congo Question in Senate.

Lodge Resolution Empowers the President to Take Action.





Washington, Dec. 10. -- Senator Lodge to-day introduced a resolution relative to the
Congo Free State. It reciters that the report of the inhuman treatment inflicted upon
the native inhabitants of the Congo Free State has been of such a nature and so well
sustained as to draw the attention of the civilized world and excite both the indignation
and the compassion of the people of the United States.

It resolves that in the opinion of the Senate the time has come when the affairs of
the Congo Free State should be made the subject of international inquiry. The Senate
advises the President that in any steps he may deem it wise to take in co-operation
with or in aid of any of the powers signatories of the treaty of Berlin which shall
seek to ameliorate the conditions of the Congo Free State and redress any evils now
existing there he will receive the Senate's cordial support.
