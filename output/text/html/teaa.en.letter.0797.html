of the West African Telegraph
Cable connecting this city with
Europe, took place on the 28th
instant, this day having been
chosen for the ceremony, being

of the Prince Royal of Portugal

-aries of the city. Officers of the 
Naval and Military forces, and 
some of the principal inhabitants 
of the city.

The Governor after a short 
discourse, in which he dwelt
on the advantages of this important 
improvement to the
Province, declared the line
open from Loanda.

In about Sixteen days
time it is intended to inaugurate 
the Royal Trans-African
Railway from this city to
Ambaca. The works of construction
of this line are
already commenced and 
there is at present every appearance 
that they will be carried
