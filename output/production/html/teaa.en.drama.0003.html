            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p class="tei_p">Initially entitled <em class="hi">The Jewel of Ethiopia</em> and published in the November 1913 issue of <em class="hi">The Crisis</em> as <em class="hi">The People of Peoples and Their Gifts to Men</em>, W. E. B. Du Bois's <em class="hi">The Star of Ethiopia</em> was performed in New York in October 1913, in Washington, D.C., in October 1915, in Philadelphia in May 1916, and in Los Angeles in May 1925. The pageant's content differed in each of the four venues. Du Bois included Abraham Lincoln in the 1913 version celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, a production with a cast of 350 that was performed before a combined audience of 14,000; meanwhile, the 1915 version, shown before the Centennial General Conference of the AME Church, stressed "the religious development of the Negro" and featured "the twelve apostles of Negro Christianity." Du Bois believed that with <em class="hi">The Star of Ethiopia</em>, the "great fact has been demonstrated that pageantry among colored people is . . . of unsurpassed beauty and can be made a means of uplift and education and the beginning of folk drama." Without question, the primary motive was pedagogic. In the pageant, as well as in <em class="hi">The Crisis</em> and his 1915 historical study <em class="hi">The Negro</em>, Du Bois sought to provide African Americans with a long and continuous history of which they could be proud. <em class="hi">The Star of Ethiopia</em> linked the origins of human civilization, the achievements of ancient Egypt, and the greatness of more recent African empires to the experiences of U.S. Blacks.</p>

         <h3>The Star of Ethiopia</h3>
         <h3>Prelude</h3>
         <span class="tei_stage">The lights of the Court of Freedom blaze. A trumpet blast is heard and four heralds, Black and of gigantic stature, appear with silver trumpets and standing at the four corners of the temple of beauty cry</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye! Men of all the Americas, and listen to the tale of the eldest and strongest of the races of mankind, whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, of the gifts of Black men to this world, the Iron Gift and Gift of Faith, the Pain of Humility and the Sorrow Song of Pain, the Gift of Freedom and of Laughter, and the undying Gift of Hope. Men of the world, keep silence and hear ye this!"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Four banner bearers come forward and stand along the four walls of the temple. On their banners is written:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"The First Gift of the Negro to the world, being the Gift of Iron. This picture shall tell how, in the deep and beast-bred forests of Africa, mankind first learned the welding of iron, and thus defense against the living and the dead."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">What the banners tell the heralds solemnly proclaim</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
         <h3>Scene 1</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">First Episode. The Gift of Iron:</p>
         <span class="tei_stage">The lights grow dim. The roar of beasts is heard and the crash of the storm. Lightnings flash. The dark figure of an African savage hurries across the foreground, frightened and cowering and dancing. Another follows defying the lightning and is struck down; others come until the space is filled with 100 huddling, crowding savages. Some brave the storm, some pray their Gods with incantation and imploring dance. Mothers shield their children, and husbands their wives. At last, dimly enhaloed in mysterious light, the Veiled Woman appears, commanding in stature and splendid in garment, her dark face faintly visible, and in her right hand Fire, and Iron in her left. As she passes slowly round the Court the rhythmic roll of tomtoms begins. Then music is heard; anvils ring at the four corners. The arts flourish, huts arise, beasts are brought in and there is joy, feasting and dancing.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">A trumpet blast calls silence and the heralds proclaim</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
         <h3>Scene 2</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The Second Episode, saying:</p>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye! All of them that come to know the Truth, and listen to the tale of the wisest and gentlest of the races of men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, of the Second Gift of Black men to this world, the Gift of Civilization in the dark and splendid valley of the Nile. Men of the world, keep silence and hear ye this."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The banners of the banner bearers change and read:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"The Second Gift of the Negro to the world, being the Gift of the Nile. This picture tells how the meeting of Negro and Semite in ancient days made the civilization of Egypt the first in the world."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">There comes a strain of might music, dim in the distance and drawing nearer. The 100 savages thronged round the whole Court rise and stand listening. Slowly there come fifty veiled figures and with them come the Sphinx, Pyramid, the Obelisk and the empty Throne of the Pharaoh drawn by oxen. As the cavalcade passes, the savages, wondering, threatening, inquiring, file by it. Suddenly a Black chieftain appears in the entrance, with the Uraeus in one hand and the winged Beetle in the other. The Egyptians unveil and display Negroes and mulattoes clothed in the splendor of the Egyptian Court. The savages salaam; all greet him as Ra, the Negro. He mounts the throne and the cavalcade, led by posturing dancers and Ra, and followed by Egyptians and savages, pass in procession around to the right to the thunder of music and tomtoms. As they pass, Ra is crowned as Priest and King. While the Queen of Sheba and Candace of Ethiopia join the procession at intervals.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Slowly all pass out save fifty savages, who linger examining their gifts. The lights grow dim as Egyptian culture dies and the fifty savages compose themselves to sleep. As they sleep the light returns and the heralds proclaim</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
         <h3>Scene 3</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The Third Episode, saying:</p>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye! All them that come to see the light and listen to the tale of the bravest and truest of the races of men, whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, of the Third Gift of black men to this world — a Gift of Faith in Righteousness hoped for but unknown; men of the world, keep silence and hear ye this!"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The banners change and read:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"The Third Gift of the Negro to the world, being a Gift of Faith. This episode tells how the Negro race spread the faith of Mohammed over half the world and built a new culture thereon."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">There is a sound of battle. The savages leap to their feet. Mohammed and fifty followers whirl in and rushing to the right beat the savages back. Fifty Songhay enter and attack the Mohammedans. Fifty other Mohammedans enter and attack the Songhay. Turning, the Songhay bear the last group of Mohammedans back to the left where they clash with the savages. Mohammedan priests strive and exhort among the warriors. At each of the four corners of the temple a priest falls on his face and cries:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"God is God! God is God! There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet!"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Four more join, others join until gradually all is changed from battle to the one universal cry:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"God is God! God is God! There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet!"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">In each corner, however, some Mohammedans hold slaves in shackles, secretly.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Mansa Musa appears at the entrance with entourage on horseback, followed by Black Mohammedan priests and scholars. The procession passes around to the right with music and dancing, and passes out with Mohammedans and Songhay, leaving some Mohammedans and their slaves on the stage. The herald proclaims</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
         <h3>Scene 4</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The Fourth Episode, saying:</p>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye! All them that know the sorrow of the world. Hear ye, hear ye, and listen to the tale of the humblest and the mightiest of the races of men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, and learn how this race did suffer of Pain, of Death and Slavery and yet of this Humiliation did not die. Men of the world, keep silence and hear ye this!"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The banners change again and say:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"The Fourth Gift of the Negro to the world, being a Gift of Humiliation. This gift shows how men can bear even the Hell of Christian slavery and live."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The Mohammedans force their slaves forward as European traders enter. Other Negroes, with captives, enter. The Mohammedans take gold in barter. The Negroes refuse gold, but are seduced by beads and drink. Chains rattle. Christian missionaries enter, but the slave trade increases. The wail of the missionary grows fainter and fainter until all is a scene of carnage and captivity with whip and chain and only a frantic priest, staggering beneath a cross and crowned with bloody thorns, wanders to and fro in dumb despair.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">There is silence. Then a confused moaning. Out of the moaning comes the slave song, "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen," and with it and through the chained and bowed forms of the slaves as they pass out is done the Dance of Death and Pain.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The stage is cleared of all its folk. There is a pause, in which comes the Dance of the Ocean, showing the transplantation of the Negro race over seas.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Then the heralds proclaim</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
         <h3>Scene 5</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The Fifth Episode, saying:</p>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye! All them that strive and struggle. Hear ye, hear ye, and listen to the tale of the stoutest and the sturdiest of the races of men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, and learn how this race did rise out of slavery and the valley of the shadow of death. Men of the world, keep silence and hear ye this!"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The banners change again and read:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"The Fifth Gift of the Negro to the world, being a Gift of Struggle Toward Freedom. This picture tells of Alonzo, the Negro pilot of Columbus, of Stephen Dorantes who discovered New Mexico, of the brave Maroons and valiant Haytians, of Crispus Attucks, George Lisle and Nat Turner."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Twenty-five Indians enter, circling the Court right and left, stealthily and watchfully. As they sense the coming of the whites, they gather to one side of the temple, watching.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Alonzo, the Negro, enters and after him Columbus and Spaniards, in mail, and one monk. They halt at the other side of the temple and look about searchingly, pointing at the Indians. Slaves follow. One of the slaves, Stephen Dorantes, and the monk seek the Indians. The monk is killed and Stephen returns, circling the Court, tells his tale and dies. The Spaniards march on the Indians. Their slaves — the Maroons — revolt and march to the left and meet the Indians on the opposite side. The French, some of the mulattoes and Negroes, enter with more slaves. They march after the Spanish. Their slaves, helped by mulattoes and Toussaint, revolt and start back. The French follow the Spaniards, but the returning Haytians meet oncoming British. The Haytians fight their way through and take their place next to the Maroons. Still more slaves and white Americans follow the British. The British and Americans dispute. Attucks leads the Americans and the British are put to flight. Spanish, French and British, separated by dancing Indians, file around the Court and out, while Maroons, Haytians and slaves file around in the opposite direction and meet the Americans. As they pass, the French, by guile, induce Toussaint to go with them. There is a period of hesitation. Some slaves are freed, some Haytians resist aggression. George Lisle, a freed Negro, preaches the true religion as the masters listen. Peace ensues and the slaves sing at their tasks. Suddenly King Cotton arrives, followed by Greed, Vice, Luxury and Cruelty. The slaveholders are seduced. The old whips and chains appear. Nat Turner rebels and is killed. The slaves drop into despair and work silently and sullenly. The faint roll of tomtoms is heard.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The heralds proclaim</span>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
         <h3>Scene 6</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The Sixth Episode, saying:</p>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye! citizens of New York, and learn of the deeds of eldest and strongest of the races of men whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, of the Sixth and Greatest Gift of Black men to the world, the Gift of Freedom for the workers. Men of New York, keep silence and hear ye this."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The banners change and say:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"The sixth and last episode, showing how the freedom of Black slaves meant freedom for the world. In this episode shall be seen the work of Garrison and John Brown; of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, the marching of Black soldiers to war and the hope that lies in little children."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The slaves work more and more dejectedly and drivers force them. Slave music comes. The tomtoms grow louder. The Veiled Woman appears with fire and iron. The slaves arise and begin to escape, passing through each other to and fro, confusedly. Benezet, Walker and Garrison enter, scattering their writings, and pass slowly to the right, threatened by slave drivers. John Brown enters, gesticulating. A knot of Negroes follow him. The planters seize him and erect a gallows, but the slaves seize his body and begin singing "John Brown's Body."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Frederick Douglass enters and passes to the right. Sojourner Truth enters and passes to the left. Sojourner Truth cries:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Frederick, is God dead?"</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Voices take up the cry, repeating: "Frederick, is God dead?" Douglass answers:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"No, and therefore slavery must end in blood."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The heralds repeat:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Slavery must end in blood."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The roll of drums is heard and the soldiers enter. First, a company in blue with Colonel Shaw on horseback.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">A single voice sings "O Freedom." A soprano chorus takes it up.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">The Boy Scouts march in.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Full brasses take up "O Freedom."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Little children enter, and among them symbolic figures of the laborer, the Artisan, the Servant of Men, the Merchant, the Inventor, the Musician, the Actor, the Teacher, Law, Medicine and Ministry, the All-Mother, formerly the Veiled Woman, now unveiled in her chariot with her dancing brood, and the bust of Lincoln at her side.</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">With burst of music and blast of trumpets, the pageant ends and the heralds sing:</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">"Hear ye, hear ye, men of all the Americas, ye who have listened to the tale of the oldest and strongest of the races of mankind, whose faces be Black. Hear ye, hear ye, and forget not the gift of Black men to this world — the Iron Gift and Gift of Faith, the Pain of Humility and Sorrow Song of Pain, the Gift of Freedom and Laughter and the undying Gift of Hope. Men of America, break silence, for the play is done."</span>
         <span class="tei_stage">Then shall the banners announce: "The play is done!"</span>
