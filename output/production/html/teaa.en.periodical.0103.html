      <p class="tei_p">Liberia College.â€”We are glad to see Dr. Blyden seems intent on promoting the efficiency of this college, at Monrovia. He is reported to have secured two able men, Rev. T. McCants Stewart, Pastor of the Bethel African M. E. Church in Sullivan street, New York, and Rev. H. M. Browne, to fill professorships. Mr. Browne, latterly supplying the late Dr. Garnet's Shiloh Presbyterian Church in Twenty-sixth street, New York, has also the appointment of U. S. Consul at Monrovia. We wish these brethren health and long years of service, with great success in training young Liberians for usefulness.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dr. Blyden, President of the College, reports increasing prosperity among the emigrants who have gone from this country, and speaks of the prospects of Liberia with much hopefulness. We notice that the bark Monrovia recently sailed from New York carrying some 50 emigrants. Of the increasing commercial interests of Liberia, we notice that the bark Monrovia, sailing thence the 14th of April last, brought 150,000 pounds of coffee, with a good supply of other products, and another American vessel was loading at the same time, to sail in a few days.</p>
