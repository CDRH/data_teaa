To the<br/> 
Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State.<br/>
Washington DC</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to advise
that I have drawn Draft No. 2.
for contingent expenses $228 37/100 Dollars
on the Secretary of State in favor of
R. A. Sherman; also Draft No 3. on
account of salary $478 Dollars on
the Secretary of State in favor of
myself endorsed to George W. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Appleton[?]</span>
All of said Drafts for the Quarters
ending Sept. 30/90 and December 31 <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">1890[?]</span>
per accompanying accounts.
I have further to request that you
suply the legation with some blank Drafts
as there is not one left. and I was
compeled to use. Dole of exchange for my Sallary
draft, &amp;c. also there is no abstract blanks
left except 2. and sallery. blanks <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">and[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">fees[?]</span>. I am satisfied the department can 
furnish them by mail cheaper than they
can be printed because they would have to be
printed in Liverpool or London as there are no printers
established here &amp;c &amp; &amp; I have the honor to be your obedient
servant, Alexander Clark Minister Resident CG</p>
