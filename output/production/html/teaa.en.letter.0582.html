      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
Loanda, June 22, 1892.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Having often had occasion to notice 
how little the Province of Angola is
known in Europe, and still less in America,
and realizing what benefits may result
to this Province and to commerce in general
if it be presented to the public in a 
condensed description, I have tried to 
fill the gap by giving in few words a
general idea of my Consular District.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit to the
Department enclosed, a Report on the
subject. It is not the reproduction of
anything of the kind previously published
in any language, but the result of 
eight years' hard study on the ground.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As soon as possible, I intend to draw
a map of the Province, also entirely

original, which will greatly facilitate
the understanding of the Report, and which
I hope the Department will publish with
it.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Heli Chatelain<br/>
U.S. Coml Agent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Enclosure:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">1 Report entitled
"Brief Description of Angola"</p>
