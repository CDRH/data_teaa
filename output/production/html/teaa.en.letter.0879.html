      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to forward herewith an extract
from the shipping news of the
Semi Weekly New York Journal
of Commerce (19 Feby 1881, see <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Enclosure[?]</span> - regarding a
statement which seems to be
made by the Master &amp; Mate
of the Bark Hazard - which
sailed from this Port bound to
Boston on or about Dec 23rd
1880.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I would state that the representations
therein made
that they had but one boat
as the other one was <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">stone[?]</span> 
on the West Coast of Africa
and none other was

<span class="hr"> </span>

was procurable and as the
wreck of it was useless &amp; was
sold for what it would bring
&amp;c is not borne out by the
facts - but on the contrary
the boat was sold to Samuel
Lewis Esquire a Barrister of Law
residing in this place and I 
respectfully call your attention
to the Enclosure viz - his letter
to me in answer to my
inquires on the subject.
He purchased the boat and
with some trifling repairs has
been using said boat frequently
from that time to the present
and the said boat is now
in good condition</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain Sir<br/>
Most Respectfully<br/>
Your Obt Servt<br/>
