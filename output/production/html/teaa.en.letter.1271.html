      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to say,
that in my No. 21, Consular,
of Feb'y 28, 1899, I
gave an account of the
condition of the Consular
Agency, at Cape Coast Castle;
adding a partial
report of the exports and
imports; including the number
of American vessels,
tonnage, number of crew &amp;c,
trading between the United
States and the Gold
Coast Colony, from July
1, 1897, to Feb'y 1, 1899, which
partial report, I have,
since,

<span class="hr"> </span>

since, supplemented, by an
official statistical report
from the Colonial Government,
from July 1, 1897, to Feb'y 1, 1899.
In my No. 21, Consular,
I stated that if the Department,
after a careful consideration
of the bulk of the trade,
between the United States
and the Gold Coast Colony,
decided it to be 
sufficient to justify the
continuation of the Agency,
I would undertake the
responsibility of making
a nomination for said
Agency. In fact, in the
absence of a proper blank
application, for office, I did
make a nomination;
the which I have not, since,
heard from. The party, thus
recommended, I have
recently heard from, who
informed me that he has
been

<span class="hr"> </span>

been having very bad health,
for several months.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">After waiting, a period of
five months, for a reply;
and not yet, being able
to know the decision of the
Department, in regards to
said Agency; and knowing
too, that I made only
temporary arrangements
for the care of the archives
and other property of said
Agency, I have thought it
my duty to ask for a
more definite understanding,
relative thereto.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
your obedient servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
M. R. and C. General.</p>
