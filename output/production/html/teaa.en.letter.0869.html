Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform
you that I have this day 
sent to the Consu. Genl
at Liverpool per S.S.
Kinsembo two Destitute
American Seamen viz
Daniel Freethey and Walter
Duval. Daniel Freethey
came upon this Consulate
from Grand Bassa
Oct 25th as per my
Dispatch No 35
and Walter Duval came
upon this Consulate
Dec. 11th both Deserters
from Am. Bark Jennie R.
Deverty. I intended to have
sent them Both to Boston

<span class="hr"> </span>

per Bark Hazard D. A. 
Roberts Master - but said
Master refused to take them
as you will see by my Dispatch
No. 41 Dec 24th
The reason I now forward
them by Steam to Liverpool 
is this - There is no American 
Vessel in Port - And I am 
not informed when one
will arrive and I fear
the men may get sick
in this climate if
detained for a long 
time &amp; believe their
chances for shipping
at Liverpool are good
I have given a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Fifteen[?]</span> days
draft on Secty of State for
96 dollars being £20. for 
their passage payable to
the order of Randall and
Fisher Agents - which
draft I trust will be 
duly honored.</p>
