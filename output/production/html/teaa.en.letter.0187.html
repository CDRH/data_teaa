Monrovia July 10, 1868</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Excellency,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The undersigned, Secretary of State for the Republic 
of Liberia, has the honor to
communicate with your Excellency,
and to represent that the President
of the Republic of Liberia appreciating
very highly the friendly relations
which exist between the Government
of the United States and Liberia,
is desirous that this relation may
be

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">His Excellency,<br/>
The Secretary of State of the United States of
America<br/>
Washington City D.C.<br/>
U.S.A.</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

be made to yield the greatest
amount of benefit to both Governments.
He considers that the affinity of the
respective Governments should
encourage a disposition to strengthen
this relation when an opportunity
offers, so as to secure the mutual
advantages which it is calculated 
to promote. He is not forgetful, in
this solicitation, of the disparity,
in point of ability, between the
Government of Liberia, the offspring,
and that of the mother Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Nevertheless, he is
of the opinion that the capability
of Liberia to administer importantly
to the commerce of the United States
would justify an arrangement between
the two Governments by which
they

<span class="hr"> </span>

they could be mutually benefited
to an unprecedented extent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">These considerations
have prompted the President of
Liberia to direct, that an inquiry 
be most respectfully communicated
to Your Excellency of the following
character:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Whether the commercial 
transactions of the citizens of the 
United States with Liberians
might no be expanded by a
proper discrimination between
the products of free and slave
labor, in the form of a moderation
of the duties on Sugar, Coffee,
Camwood and Palm Oil imported into
the United States by Liberian
vessels or the vessels of citizens of
the 

<span class="hr"> </span>

United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Second. Whether in view of the
necessity in Liberia of the proper
class of immigrants to build up and 
strengthen her, and to contribute
to the development of her resources
and in view of the necessity of 
the emigration of the colored people
of the United States, the Government
of the U. States would consent to
facilitate an undertaking by
Liberia to attract and bring
to her shores, such of these
people as might be willing to emigrate.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Referring to the first
query, it is only necessary to invite
Your Excellency's attention to
these facts: that the Commerce 
of Liberia, yet in its incipiency,
cannot,

<span class="hr"> </span>

cannot, for some years, under
the influence of a competition
with the products of older states,
especially those of slave labor,
became as vigorous and profitable
as it would: that the work of
enfranchisement and the abrogation
of the slave trade, in which the
Government of the United States
takes preeminently the lead,
would be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> by the difficulty
of introducing the products of
slave labor into the U. States;
and the fact, known too well
to be named, that the Government
of H. B. Majesty impose no duty
on Palm Oil introduced into Her
dominion

<span class="hr"> </span>

dominion from the Coast of Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the subject of the 
second query, it is proper to
remark that the difficulty of 
procuring a class of immigrants
much needed in the whole country
and especially to occupy contested
points clearly within the political
jurisdiction of the Republic of Liberia,
will constrain the Government of
Liberia herself, to invite and emigrate
them by the permission of and aid 
of the Mother Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">With sentiments of the
highest consideration.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be
Your excellency's
most obedient servant<br/>
J. N. Lewis</p>
