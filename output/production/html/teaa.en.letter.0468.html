      <p class="tei_p">Commercial Agency<br/>
Stanley Falls, Kongo Free State<br/>
March 17th 1893.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/> 
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you of my departure 
from Stanley Pool February 9th
and arrival at this place March 9th.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The situation here is extremely interesting 
as the State has began its war against
the Arabs who occupy the government territory 
to the Eastward of the red line marked
on the enclosed chart.</p>    

      <p class="tei_p">In the South Lieutenant Dhanis Commissary 
of the Kassai District with headquarters at 
Lousambo has with him six thousand men
eight hundred State soldiers, and five thousand 
natives under the command of Kongo
Lutete, a former slave of Tippo Tibs, but
who declared himself free, and has
thrown his whole force in with the
Government. This army is marching to 
Kassongo and Nyangone, possibly to 
Lake Tanganyka where they would meet
the troops of the anti-slave society under
command of Captain Jacques. Mr. Dhanis
met the Arabs near Nyangone under command 
of Seffon, (a son of Tippo Tibs)
and gained a victory killing some thousand
men, and capturing twelve hundred guns.
The next day the town was captured and 
the Chief Munnci Moherra &amp; his son 
killed and Seffon badly wounded. He is
now on his way to Kassongo, after which
    


his movements are uncertain. This two
Arab chiefs killed at Nyangone were
the ones who massacred Mr. Hodister's
expedition last year between Bena
Kamba and Riba Riba. In the month 
of December they also killed the two
State officers who had been their
prisoners for nine months in Kassongo.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">An expedition consisting of two large
river steamers and one thousand men
leaves Basoko this month to co-operate
with Mr. Dhanis using Bena Kamba as
a base of supplies. This force goes down
the Lomami River, and is under the 
command of Commandante Charltain.
He has been kind enough to ask me
to accompany him as his guest and
I have accepted the invitation.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">This most aggressive action against 
the Arabs has been taken in accordance 
with Chapter I Article I Paragraphs
2. and 6. of the General
Act of Brussels for the suppression
of the slave trade.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Arabs are gradually forcing themselves 
to the Westward, and are now
hunting slaves in the Lopori Tschonapa and 
Loukenye Rivers. The captured negroes
are used as money to purchase ivory
and if the ivory is sent to the East
Coast they are sold to dealers from the 
North.</p>
  
      <p class="tei_p">It is impossible for me to write lengthy 
reports on the subject while I am so 
constantly on the move, but I have
been keeping a journal in which every thing
of interest I have so far seen is noted
and when I finish shall write out a 
full report and present it to the



Department in person.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
