<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This image comes from <em>The Missionary Magazine</em>, which followed the convention of including photographs of mission fields in articles about missionaries serving abroad. This particular photo is of a so-called "Kafir Hut" in South Africa in 1898. "Kafir" was a racist term used by white settler colonists to describe Black Africans in the British Cape Colony. Scholars have traced the etymology of "kafir" to the Arabic &#x6A9;&#x627;&#x641;&#x631; meaning "infidel" or a person who does not believe in the authority of Allah. Images of South Africa circulating in the United States were rare. As David Killingray and Andrew Roberts note, "For missionaries, photographs were an obvious way to arouse and maintain support at home" for their work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Virginia-Lee Webb, in calling attention to how "generic field photographs" compare to those staged in a studio, argues that scholars must deconstruct these images to "reveal how racist misconceptions, gender and social biases, stylistic genres, and colonial agendas affect the content."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> This (arguably staged) photo depicts African women as Americans expected to see them: as "exotic" native subjects untouched by Western modernity. The viewer does not see the complexities of the cultural lives of these women targeted for American missionizing.</p>
