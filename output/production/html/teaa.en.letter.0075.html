      <p class="tei_p">St. Paul de Loanda April 9, 1864</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Kroomen left here by 
U.S.S. "Sacramento" have requested 
me to address you on the Subject of 
their obtaining passage to their 
home in the vessel under your command.
complying with this desire I would 
beg first to day a few words in 
correction of any misapprehension which 
you may be under in consequence 
of possible misrepresentation on their 
part.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">These men were shipped by 
Captain Collins, Commanding U.S. 
Ship "Sacramento" with the distinct 
understanding that they were to be 
discharged on arrival in this port; 
of course neither Captain Collins nor 
the Kroomen were aware of the 
extreme

         <span class="hr"> </span>

extreme difficulty of returning from this 
port to Monrovia, else the men in 
question would never have been Shipped.
They are now here in an almost 
destitute condition, and without work.
Should one of U.S. Ships arrive here 
from the European Squadron, there would 
be an opportunity of their returning to 
Monrovia. but as there is no probability 
of such arrival for some months
to come it would be an act 
of the greatest kindness and charity on 
your part toward these men should 
you feel disposed to grant them a 
passage. I believe they have 
sufficient money to supply such necessaries 
as they would consume on the 
passage; so that you would be at no 
trouble concerning their maintenance.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In conclusion I would beg 
leave to say that in addressing you on 
this point I have done so solely on behalf 
of the Kroomen with whose unhappy 
circumstances here I am too well 
acquainted, and by no means in an offi-

official capacity, nor as fulfilling a 
duty to-wards them for they knew 
perfectly well before being shipped 
that they would be discharged in 
this port.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor<br/> 
to be<br/>
Yours Respectfully<br/>
Signed, Augustus A. Silva</p>
