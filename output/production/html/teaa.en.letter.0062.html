      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In accordance with my Dispatch
to the Department of State
dated St Paul de Loanda December
31st 1864 informing you of my
unavoidable visit to this country
and my reasons for so doing. I
have the honor to say I arrived
here on the 4th ultimo and on
the 20th inst I return to my
post of duty upon Steamer <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>
via Lisbon.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">While at Lisbon on my
way here I had the honor of
an interview with our minister Mr
Harvey and explained to him my
views on the necessity of creating
a Consulate at St Paul de Loanda
instead of a Commercial Agency.
I recommend this <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">alteration[?]</span> not
with any motive of personal <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> or <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">pecuniary[?]</span> benefit, but
only that the representative of the
United States should at least rank
with Consuls of other nations</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The British and
Brazilian

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">The Hon Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</span>
         <span class="hr">Â </span>

Brazilian nations have first class
consuls there. The Portuguese
officials do not consider a Commercial
Agent <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> to a Consular
Agent, and it does not appear
to me to be in conformity
with the dignity of the United
States as a first class power,
to rank last and least in a
country situated so long or <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">distance[?]</span>
from its Government, or its
representative in Portugal. Mr
Harvey impressed with the importance
of my representation
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">promised[?]</span> to draw your attention
to the subject. I therefor submit
these remarks in addition,
feeling convinced as now our unhappy
war is over. Commercial
prosperity with our part of the
coast of Africa and the United States
will be resumed on as prosperous a
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">note[?]</span> as before the war fully
justifying the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> of Office
herein requested.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor<br/>
to be<br/>
Your most Obdt Servt<br/>
Augustus Archer Silva<br/>
Commercial Agent<br/>
at<br/>
St. Paul de Loanda</p>
