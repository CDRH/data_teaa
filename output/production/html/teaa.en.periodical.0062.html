         <h3>Christian Missions.</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">Many of the English missionary societies laboring in Africa are
experiencing serious trials in connection with the sickness and death
of several of their missionaries and also from newly awakened hostility 
on the part of the native chieftains. Bishop Parker, of the English
Church Missionary Society, lately died of fever at the southern end
of Victoria Nyanza. Following so soon upon the murder of Bishop
Hamington, the death of his successor will be a sad blow to the Church
Missionary Society. Moreover, all the stations of this Society in East 
Africa, as well as of the London Society on lake Tanganyika, have
experienced severe trials of late in connection with the <em class="hi">hongo</em>, or
claims for tribute, made by the native chieftains. The Free Church
of Scotland's mission on Lake Nyasa has been compelled to suspend
its missionary operations, and to attend solely to self-defence against 
the assaults of Arab slave-traders, who have entered anew and with
vigor upon their infamous traffic. The losses by death of English
Baptist missionaries on the Congo have been so numerous as to be
well nigh crushing.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The <em class="hi">Societe des Missions Evangeliques</em> has sent four French teachers 
as aids to the American Presbyterian Mission at the Gaboon. This
mission, founded in 1842, has now six stations: Alongo, upon the island 
of Corisco; Baraka, or Glars, upon the equator; Angoma, upon
the Gaboon river, and Kangwe, on the river Ogowe. The French
teachers have received a hearty welcome from the French authorities
of the country as well as from the American missionaries. It has become 
an absolute necessity that the French language should be used
in the mission schools.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The missionaries of the American Baptist Missionary Union on
the Congo further report of the revival at Banza Manteke. About
two hundred have been baptized and enrolled as church members.
More are asking for baptism. An interesting incident is given showing 
the zeal of the converts in transporting timber and iron a distance
of fifty miles for the building of a chapel. Most of the men have
made the journey three, and some four times, bringing loads on 
their heads. To do this requires a walk of three or four hundred
miles. The women have hired carriers, and thus have done their 
part. The boys, too, have brought half-loads.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Bishop William Taylor in his Quadrennial Report to the General 
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, says that he had
superintended the regular work in the Liberia Conference and established 
self-supporting missions on the Cavalla river. He has made
a beginning in the Congo region, and Angola south of the Congo river;

<span class="hr"> </span>

in all 36 new stations have been opened by him, with 32 mission
houses, built at a cost of £20,000 and all are free from debt. The stations 
in Angola are, 1. St. Paul de Loando, with a self-supporting
school. 2. Dondo, 240 miles distant from Loanda, with a self-supporting 
school also. 3. Nhanguepepo, 51 miles farther inland,
a receiving-station where missionaries can tarry and learn languages. 
4. Pungo Andongo is 39 miles farther on a mountain 
elevation. 5. Malange is 60 miles further along the same path.
The objective point of this line of stations is the Tushilange country,
some 1,200 miles from the coast. Bishop Taylor has a steam yacht in
process of transportation around Stanley Falls, for use on the Upper
Congo and Kasai.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The African Methodist E. Church has sent a missionary and
his wife to Sierra Leone, and others are to follow, as will appear from
the following extract from the <em class="hi">A. M. E Church Review</em> for October:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"The African Methodist Episcopal Church, a Church in many respects 
especially fitted for the work, is becoming aroused as to its duties 
and possibilities in Africa. It would be putting this Church in a false
light to say that hitherto it has had no aspirations in this direction.
The want of money has been the principal reason for remaining away.
But meanwhile the work of preparing men has been going on slowly
but steadily, till now the outlook is bright. During the next quadrennium, 
under the superintendency of our newly elected Bishop
Tanner, and by the aid of the Women's Mite Missionary Society, we
may expect a great advance upon what has been done in the past at
this post. Dr. Townsend,—"Missionary Secretary,"—has already given
notice that his department stands ready to do its best for Africa, and
the ladies of the Mite Society are asking that the work of sustaining
a missionary and developing a school there be given them as their
specific work."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The <em class="hi">Misssions und Heidenbote</em>, of Neukirchen, for April, gives the.
following account of Roman Catholic missions in Eastern Africa:</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Until lately we had to do with two different Roman Catholic
missions. The one is the so-called 'Congregation of the Holy Ghost
and of the Sacred Heart of Mary,' commonly called 'the Black Fathers.' 
They number some fifty missionaries, working at seven central
stations, none of them very far removed from the coast. Besides.
missionary work strictly so called, they also carry on a general work
of culture. Especially are they devoted to the care of the sick. The
other Roman Catholic mission is that of the 'African Algerian Missionaries,' 
commonly called 'the White Fathers.' They have advanced
their stations far into the interior, and set them as widely as possible

<span class="hr"> </span>

apart. As it appears, they limit themselves mainly to proper missionary 
work. We do not know the number of their laborers. As we
learn from the journals, there has come on the field a new German
mission of the Roman Catholic Church, of which a column of
thirteen priests, besides artisans and agriculturists, is already on African 
soil. The south of the German possessions in Eastern Africa is
assigned to them, while the Kilimandjaro region is to remain under
the Brothers of the Holy Ghost. The Roman Church is bestirring
herself to lay her hand upon Eastern Africa."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The exttension of European protectorates over various
parts of Africa is likely to necessitate many changes in missionary
operations. The French at the Gaboon are not alone in requiring that
missionary schools shall lay aside the English and use French.
French Protestants in Basuto-land assert that they are required
to use the English and not the French in all schools of the higher
grades. The German governor at Cameroons placed such restrictions
upon the English Baptist missions within the German territory that
it was thought best to transfer the mission to the Basle Society. Already 
the English Church Missionary Society agents in the east African 
lake country complain of difficulties from the German occupation 
of territory between the lakes and Zanzibar.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Before a substantial and permanent superstructure can be erected 
there must be prepared for it a solid and enduring foundation.
This foundation-laying is what the Protestant missionary societies
are now doing for Christianity in Africa, at an annual expense of about
$1,500,000. Missionaries have taught many useful mechanical trades
to the natives, such as masonry, carpentering and tailoring, and, in
addition, they have imparted no small amount of knowledge of reading, 
writing, arithmetic, and of the printing press, the saw-mill and
the steamboat, and they have generally been the first to explore and
describe the lakes and rivers of Africa, and impart a correct knowledge 
of them and of the capabilities of the adjacent country. They
have done more. By grammars, dictionaries, vocabularies, and
translation of the Bible, they have usefully illustrated two hundred
African languages and dialects. By their researches they have enriched 
the sciences of zoology, botany, and anthropology, and many
other branches of scientific investigation. They have guided commerce 
and civilization in their forward marches, and, while their work
may at times have been imperfect, and may not now appear as decidedly 
Christian in all its aspects, it has all been a part of that foundation 
work upon which the grand edifice of a pure Christianity will at
length be reared.</p>

         <h3>Liberia.</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">Liberia is growing more and more indigenous and hopeful. The
Aborigines are entering the political and social life of the Republic.
The Kroomen, especially, are engaging largely in civilized commerce
and in agriculture, and are becoming a part of the permanent element
of the population.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Hon. E. J. Barclay, Secretary of State of Liberia, wrote as follows
to Charles Hall Adams Esq., Consul of that Republic at Boston:-</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"In former years the volume of trade between the two countries
(Liberia and the United States) was much larger than at present.
Our palm oil and camwood were the chief productions exported to
the United States, but since kerosene and cotton seed oil have come
prominently to the front there, the exports of palm oil to that conntry 
have become almost <em class="hi">nil</em> compared with what it used to be. In those
days it was not an uncommon thing for a single ship to take among
other products, palm oil to the value of $28,000 to $36,000. The
vacancy caused by the decline of the trade of this article in the United 
States has not been filled. Your figures with reference to the export 
of coffee into the United States have been carefully scanned.
We are entirely in accord as to the fact that our trade in this article
might be increased to much larger proportions, and the quantity exported 
to the United States might be multiplied a hundred fold. Yet
when the facts of the culture being in its infancy and of there being
no banks nor other financial institutions to assist the growers, and no
machinery except in a few instances, are considered, I am of the
opinion that our cultivators have made a tolerable good showing in
foreign markets. The total product for 1887 was about 1,200,000 lbs
which are distributed as follows; to Germany, 600,000 lbs., United
States, 301,000 lbs., Belgium, France and England 149,000 lbs., Holland 
150,000 lbs.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Bishop William Taylor in his Quadrennial Report, states;—"The
productive interests of Liberia are fairly prosperous. Within ten
miles of Monrovia, up the St. Paul's river, there are ten steam sugar
cane crushing mills, and during the past year more than 600,000
pounds of coffee have been exported from Monrovia."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Hon. Ezekiel E. Smith, Minister Resident and Consul General of
the United States at Liberia, thus addressed the Hon. John H. B. Latrobe, 
under date of Monrovia, September 1st:—"As a member of a
long enslaved race I bless God for the inception, organization and
perpetuation of the philanthropic institution, the American Colonization 
Society. I shall pray that the choicest benedictions of Heaven
may rest upon the executive and members and friends. The most

<span class="hr"> </span>

tacile pen, the most eloquent or gifted orator cannot describe the
possibilities of Liberia as they present themselves ot the eye."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In this connection may be stated the notable fact that, by act of
the national Parliament of Brazil in May, slavery was abolished throughout 
the Empire. For years a popular feeling in favor of emancipation
has been growing; but now the government has suddenly moved in
the matter and the glorious deed is done. This act is one in which
philanthropists and Christians may well rejoice, and it will have an
important bearing on the interests of the kingdom of Christ in Brazil
and in Africa. So strong is the love of "fatherland" in the uncontaminated 
Brazilian Negroes that there is a steady current setting
eastward from that Empire, the "expatriates" paying their own way
to West Africa.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article">
         <h3>America's Share.</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">Is not America to share more largely in this new interest for Africa? 
We, who have millions of people the best adapted to its climate—
to be its sailors, pioneers, merchants, colonists and missionaries—
are we to be scarcely more than idle spectators of the general
movement for it? Are our growing millions of its children, rising
daily in intellectual and moral improvement, to take no telling part in
its redemption? With the immense prospective growth of our Negro 
population will doubtless come considerable development of its
business talent and wealth: in spite of its social disadvantages, can its
"fatherland" fail then to powerfully attract its enterprise, its religion
and civilization generally?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In God's own time the great mystery that has rested upon Africa 
and her people shall be made clear. She shall be favored with untold 
blessings, and they shall live in the light of an ennobled civilization 
and a pure Christianity.</p>
