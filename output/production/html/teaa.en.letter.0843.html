      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to
acknowledge the receipt
of Your Dispatch No
9. Feb. 25th with Enclosure
Copy of Letter written by
Cornelia W Martin relative
to the death and obsequies of
the late Revd Albert Bushnell
at this place Dec. 3rd 1879.
I am very glad indeed of the
services of the U.S. Consul
Ameliorated in any degree the
pain of the saddened hearts of
Mrs Bushnell or Miss Cameron
on this sad occasion and
I hereby extend my sympathies to
the good ladies of Auburn in

<span class="hr"> </span>

their affliction.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With regard to the
removal of the remains to
Gaboon. the Agent of the
Sacisty Mr Christy in Liverpool
has written me that the <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear">[?]</span>
will not under any circumstances
take the remains however
Securely encased they may be
so the second proposition of
erecting a stone - prepared in
the states will be best.
And I have written Mrs Bushnell
this day to this effect
promising to bring the stone in
one of Yates and Porterfields vessels
from New York and superintend
the placing on my return in the 
fall.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to remain<br/>
Your Most Obt Servt<br/>
Judson A Lewis<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
