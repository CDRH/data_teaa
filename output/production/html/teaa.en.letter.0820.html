      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St. Paul de Loanda.<br/>
November 18th 1887.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon James D. Porter<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose here
with copy of a communication from Mr. Jos.
Clark of the A. B. Missy. Unions at Palabala
Station in the Congo Free State.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This matter has already been brought
under the notice of the Department through
despatch No. 33 under date of Sept 30 1887 and
copy of petition enclosed therein.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By referring to Consular Instructions,
Par. 26 Page 10. I find that by the limitation
of jurisdiction this Consulate is prevented,
unless under special instructions from the Department, 
from taking such action as would relieve
these United States citizens from the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> of which
they complain.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is to be deplored that any 
of



of the citizens of our great country should
find theirselves the objects of injustice and
wrong, but how much more room there is
for regret when it is remembered that these
people are not only americans but are exponents 
of principles which should influence
all christendom to aid and protect them.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Unfortunately, on this coast right
unsupported by power is weak; indivuals
and associations thrive or suffer according
to the positions taken by their Governments
in securing to them their rights.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is the opinion of experience African
residents that, for the protection of the citizens
of the United States who are now, or may
become, inhabitants of the Congo Free State,
an agent from our Government should visit
this state at least once a year, and that 
the adoption of such a course would create
a moral influence sufficient to protect
the interests of our citizens.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In view of the Department
deciding to act upon the suggestion contained
in these opinions as quoted by me, I
would respectfully call the attention of
the



the Department to the fact that the geographical 
position and the lightness of its duties,
places this Consulate in a situation to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> 
and satisfactorily perform any work
the Department may see fit to instruct it to
enter into in the Congo Free State.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Henry F. Downing,<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
