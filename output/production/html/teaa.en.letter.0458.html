      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to report my arrival
at this place March 22 at 6:30
p.m.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The next morning I called upon the 
Hon. Edwin H. Terrell the United States
Minister and also upon Mr. George
W. Roosevelt United States Consul.
In the afternoon I called upon Mr.
Edmund Van Eetvelde, the Secretary
of the Interior of the Congo State
and also upon the Count de
Grelle-Roqier, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs of the Congo
and by both of these gentlemen
I was received in a must cordial
manner
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

manner.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">They expressed themselves as 
being gratified at the United States
filling the vacancy caused by
Mr. Taunt's death, and offered
me every facility for acquiring
information both here and in 
the Free State.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Van Eetvelde has received
orders for me to have any
vacant quarters in the Government 
houses, and also that
I be taken into one of the messes
at Boma, until I can get my
own house and that the 
State Doctors attend me in case
of sickness.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The next day I received a 
notification from the Count de
Grelle-Roqier that His Majesty
the King requested one to come to 
the Royal Palace at Brussels
Saturday afternoon at half 
after three.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I presented myself at the 
Palace
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

Palace
at the appointed time and was
most cordially received by His
Majesty who after making complimentary 
remarks regarding the 
United States (to which I replied
in a suitable manner) said he 
was pleased to see that a 
Bill had been introduced into 
the Senate making provision for 
a Consul General and Vice
Consul in the Congo. He asked
me if I thought it would 
become a law to which I 
replied that it was impossible 
to say.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">He said every facility would 
be given me and he hoped
that my visit to the state
would be productive of 
good results to its commerce.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The audience lasted nearly
an hour and in that time
I became thoroughly impressed
by
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

by 
the fact that His Majesty was
perfectly familiar with every
detail of the workings of the 
Government of the Congo State.
It is stated here in Brussels
that no move is ever taken
without his knowledge and 
consent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir,<br/>
Very respectfully<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>

Commercial Agent</p>
