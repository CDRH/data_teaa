      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
respectfully to inform you
that the 1st of Dec. 1886 was
celebrated by the authorities
and citizens of Liberia
as a public holiday on 
account of the achievement
obtained by the early settlers
of this city (Monrovia the
capitol) over the Day-tribes
once the most powerful
tribe on the West Coast
of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of Africa. The day was
pleasantly spent. The 
President of the Republic
of Liberia had public
reception in the capital
at the exective mansion.
I had the honor to be
present and took occasion
to pay tribute of respect to the
memory of the early heroes of
those days who fought 
manfully to gain this
Republic. His excellency
the President H. R. W.
Johnson proposed the
health of the President of the
United States which was
received cheerfully. In
recognition of which 
I

<span class="hr"> </span>

I spoke of the President
Grover Cleveland; his
zeal, his earnestness in
the performance of his
weighty responsibilities
and of the strength and 
grandeur of the government
of the United States which
will ever live as ages
roll on into eternity. I pray 
the government of the United 
States may ever live to
take active part in the
concerns generally in my
race in this dark and
benighted land.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Samuel S. Sevier<br/>
Acting Consul General</p>
