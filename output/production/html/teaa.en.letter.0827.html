      <p class="tei_p">I have to acknowledge
the receipt of Circular
No 16 - Dept of State Washington
dated August 27th 1879 - regarding
the condition of the Consulate &amp;c
and in reply would say
1st The instructions and correspondence
received are not bound and indexed
for convenient reference.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2nd The outgoing dispatches and correspondence
are fairly transcribed to
date in their respective record books
but not indexed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">3rd Press copies are not used
for any part of the correspondence
of this Consulate</p>

<span class="hr"> </span>

of any kind preserved
in this Consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">5th There has been no detailed
permanent record kept of the
accounts of the Consulate</p>

      <p class="tei_p">6th I have no suggestion to
offer the Department concerning
the care of the records and archives
excepting that I believe they should
be carefully preserved and kept in
convenient form for reference.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Upon taking charge of
this Consulate Sept. 16th 1879. I 
wrote the Dept under date of Sept
19th Dispatch No 2 - that I found 
the archives in a very bad and disorganized
condition and stated there
was no Case in which to keep the
Record Books &amp;c. and asked for
instructions if I would be allowed
anything by the Department for
necessary furniture (cases &amp;c) for
the proper preservation of the
Records &amp;c. I am now at
work as fast as I can find

time - separate from my merchantile
duties in putting the condition
of the Consular papers &amp;c in
proper shape</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
