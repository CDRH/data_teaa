      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St Paul de Loanda<br/>
13 December 1884.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
circular dated August 21st and in reply have to state
that the principal duties of this Consulate at this port 
are:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Taking charge of distressed subjects principally belonging
to crews of Whalers; during the last 18 months about 60
have applied to this Consulate and they would have been
in great difficulties if no Consulate existed. Generally
two trading vessels come every year, and the imports
from America may be put down on an average in
this way at about $12000. The Exports are nil as
there are no American houses here and the Produce
is sent principally to Lisbon and Liverpool</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Very often Whalers come into Port who as a rule would be in
great difficulties with their crews in the event of their
being no Consulate. Last year I had 14 Whalers in
Port at one time.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">These I may say are the principal duties
of the Consul at this Port.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Your most Obedient Servant<br/> 
Robt S Newton<br/>
U.S. Vice Consul.</p>
