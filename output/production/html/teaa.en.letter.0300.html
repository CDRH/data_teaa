      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States 
of America, at Sierra Leone 
16th March 1866.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform 
the Department of a 
great and important change 
in Her Majesty's Government 
with regard to the colonies of 
her dominion on this Coast.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The four colonies Gambia, 
Sierra Leone, (this Colony includes 
the Sherbro Island and a 
very large tract of the mainland
interior of the island 
and known as the Sherbro 
Country) Lagos and Cape 
Coast, which heretofore have 
been separate Governments, 
are now consolidated in one, 
under a Governor General 
His Excellency Samuel Wensley 
Blackall, until this change Governor

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To the<br/>
Hon W. H. Seward<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</span>



Governor of the Colony of Sierra Leone.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">His residence will be in 
this city, (Freetown) which will, 
because of its central position, 
and commercial importance,
be the head-quarters of the 
new style of Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I respectfully desire to request 
the Department to inform 
me, if section 420, in Chapter 
26 of the Consular Regulations 
which reads thus, "Consuls general 
are entitled to a salute of 
nine guns, consuls to a salute 
of seven guns, vice consuls, 
consular agents, commercial agents, 
and vice commercial 
agents, to a salute of five guns;" 
is now in force.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The U.S.S. "Kearsarge", Commander 
A.D. Harrell, arrived 
in this port on the 7th of 
March last, I visited the 
vessel, and on leaving received no 
salute, 



salute, governing myself by 
the above section of the Consular 
Regulations, I wrote to 
Commander Harrell asking 
his reasons for with-holding 
the usual salute, and 
received in answer, "I have 
to say in reply, that although 
I have thirty years experience 
in the Navy, I have never seen 
an officer of your grade (Consular 
Agent) saluted. According to the
Naval Regulations, I am not 
permitted to salute any person below the 
rank of Consul." this is my 
reason for desiring information 
on the subject, because if 
my Regulations are not correct
(the book is dated 1856)
there are newer ones, and it
is necessary I should have 
them, as Commander Harrell 
told me, U.S. vessels of war 
would, hereafter, frequently visit 
this port for the purpose 
of coaling.

<span class="hr">Â </span>

of coaling.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This is the first vessel of 
war of the United States which 
has visited this port since 
the date of my commission 
in September 1860, and as others 
are coming, I desire to be perfectly
acquainted with all that 
is required of me, and all that 
is due to me, in my official 
intercourse with such vessels, 
of Chapter 26 in the Regulations 
does not cover the whole subject.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I forgot to mention that 
the island of Bulamo, at the 
mouth of the Rio Grande river, 
is a dependency of this colony 
of Sierra Leone.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would recommend, when 
sending official paper is a 
place like this, it should 
be white, as the blue deteriorates 
very rapidly.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your ob'd't servant<br/>
Henry Rider<br/>
U.S. Consular Agent</p>
