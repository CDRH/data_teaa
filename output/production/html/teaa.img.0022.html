  <p>Mohun labeled this sketch "Issanghi Arab Post, Chief Bwana Abi Bou." Isangi is a town located near the meeting point of the Lomami and Congo Rivers. Lomami is a tributary of the Congo and both rivers were important conduits for trade during the nineteenth century. Isangi was the site of an Arab post controlled by Chief Bwana Abi Bou. Mohun identified Abi Bou Ben Said Ben Juma Maraj&#xE9;be as a slave trader operating out of Isangi. He also stated the he was one of the many nephews of the notorious slave trader Hamed Ben Mohammed Ben Juma Maraj&#xE9;be (a.k.a. "Tippo Tib"). Often American and European travelers in Africa designated Arabic-speaking African Muslims with light-brown skin as "Arabs." However, this post was most likely manned by Arab slave traders. Regardless, Mohun understood the importance of its location near the two rivers to "commerce operations." Later, in 1898, Isangi would become one of the many sites for rubber factories when King Leopold II granted the Lomami Company a concession&#x2014;an area over which the company enjoyed exclusive rights to run their business.</p>
