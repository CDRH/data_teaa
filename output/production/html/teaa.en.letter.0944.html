      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform the Department that my apprehension as expressed in my No. 26. that Mr. Rudolph Hirsch, the gentleman recently appointed to be Vice Consul General of the United States at Monrovia, would be incapacitated by the feebleness of his health to act in that capacity– is now realized; and Mr Hirsch is about to leave Liberia for some more desirable climate. I can only express my regret

         <span class="hr"> </span>

regret at the trouble caused by the failure of these attempts to select a gentleman fitted to this position; but the hindrances have thus far arisen out of circumstances which it was impossible to foresee or to control: Of course I have not Judged it expedient under the circumstances to present the name of Mr. Hirsch to the Government, nor to hand to that gentleman the certificate of his appointment. That certificate is returned herewith. And I have the honor to suggest the name of Mr. Marinus Adrianus Ammney, a native of Schedam, Holland, who has married into a Liberian family and is engaged in the culture of coffee at Monrovia; and is, therefore, permanently settled at Monrovia. I have written out a bond and caused the same to be executed in the amount of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of two thousand dollars ($2,000.) security for the official conduct of the office by Mr. Ammey; this I hope will prove satisfactory. And I have to request, respectfully, that the usual certificate of appointment be issued to that gentleman by the Department of State.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir:<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
J Milton Turner</p>
