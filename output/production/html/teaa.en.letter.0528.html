18th June 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose
copy of a letter I addressed to the President
of the United States Government on the 1st 
June 1883 since which date I have not
been honored with a reply, and have acted
as Acting United States Consul, and United
States Vice Consul on occasions since then
at this place and as Mr Vice Consul
Robert Scott Newton leaves for England
permanently in August next, I venture to
crave Your Excellency's kind indulgence
for the appointment as Acting United States
Consul

<span class="hr">Â </span>

Consul or Vice Consul in his place</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg to draw Your Excellency's
attention to the fact that I have faithfully
served the United States Government on 
many occasions; and venture to hope that
in view of Mr. Newton's retirement and
of the experience I have had here, that
Your Excellency will give my request your
serious and kind attention.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My agent in London will
send Your Excellency copies of my several 
nominations here</p>

      <p class="tei_p">and awaiting Your Excellency's
gracious reply,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Your Excellency's<br/>
Most obedient and
Humble servant<br/>
Wm S. Bent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To
His Excellency
The President of
the United States Government<br/>
