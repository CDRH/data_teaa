      <p class="tei_p">Excellency,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Considering the friendly relation
which exists between Madagascar and the U.S.
of America, I thought it desirable to forward
herewith to Your Excellency, Copies of the 
Correspondence and Reports on the negociations
between our Plenipotentiaries and those of the 
French Government, which took place at
Tamatave; though I refrain myself from
making any remarks thereon, I feel sure
that these papers will show you plainly
the extreme desire of the Malagasy
Government to revive the friendly relation
with the Government of the French Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I leave to your own good judgment
to do with these informations whatever you
think proper for the benefit of Madagascar.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain,<br/> 
Your Excellency's<br/>
Sincere Friend<br/>
(Signed) Rainilaiarivony<br/>
Prime Minister</p>
