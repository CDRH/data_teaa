      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
transmit to you the
intelligence, that while
writing my dispatch
No. 10, Oct. 29, 1898, the
German Steamer, referred
to arrived. Preceding
the arrival of said Steamer,
the Cabinet was in
session. So strong was the
opposition, of Hons.
G. W. Gibson, Secretary
of State, and ex-President,
Johnson, now

Postmaster General, to the
banishment of, and the
hireing out of the prisioners
of war, that the Cabinet
finally decided not
to send the prisoners
away, but to return
them to the country,
up the St. Paul's river,
and at present leave
them in the hands of
the President.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Secretary of State and
Postmaster General, both
declared that they would
resign the Cabinet if the 
prisoners were thus, as
at first proposed dealt
with. I think the
continued existence of the
Republic, for any
considerable length of time is
doubtful. I have the honor
to be your obedient servant,<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith.</p>
