Gaboon River Dec 1st 1862</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon William H Seward<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to 
inform you that I arrived here upon
the 3d day of November 1862.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The vessel
upon which I took passage from the 
United States was unavoidably delayed, 
causing me to be much longer 
reaching this place than I anticipated 
when I left New York.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In 
order to account for any informalities 
that may exist in the present
correspondence permits me to state 
that the book forwarded me from the 
departments of state entitled Instructions 
to Consuls and Commercial 
Agents was mislaid in America and 
has not yet reached me. I would 
respectfully request that another book be 
sent me

<span class="hr"> </span>

I have received information through
Commodore Baron Didelot of the 
French fleet upon this coast that 
there are two iron clad rebel gun
boats at the islands of Cape De
Verde, which had succeeded in destroying 
a number of American Merchant 
vessels and were now in wait for
the United States ship of war
Saratoga supposed by them to be bound 
up the Coast. I have no information
in regard to the whereabouts 
of the Saratoga. I have written 
to the Comml Agt Monrovia 
and to Cape Palmas as they 
are the only points upon the Coast
where she would be likely to
stop if bound towards the De
Verde islands from down the coast 
Commodore <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">T.[?]</span> B. received his
information through the Portuguese 
mail that runs from Lisbon to 
St Paul de Loando.

<span class="hr"> </span>
    
By information received from 
the same source, (Commodore D.)
from the Spanish authorities at
Fernando Po I have reason to
apprehend that the same difficulties 
that existed between the governments
of the United States and 
Spain in the years 1859 and 1860
in relation to Spanish interference 
with American Missionaries
upon the island of Corisco
are likely to be revived.</p> 
 
      <p class="tei_p">A copy of the regulations of 
the Hon Secretary of treasury to 
which reference is made in Circular 
No 17, of July 31st 1862, has not 
reached me</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
be your most obt servant<br/>
Henry May Com. Agt.</p>
