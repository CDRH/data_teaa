June 26/88</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hon. G. L. Rives<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of May 26th 1888, came
to hand when I was from home;
therefore I could not reply. I now
take this opportunity to say that it is
impossible for me to send in to
the State Department proper
voucher for messenger service
rendered the U.S. Legation at Monrovia
Liberia for the amount of $75.50/100
because I cannot get said proper
voucher from the messenger, for
I dont know where he is. And

<span class="hr">Â </span>

again, Sir, if I could get a
voucher it would not be a proper
one; because the messenger
cannot write his <span class="underline">Name</span>. He was
a native man of the <del>
            <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">usual[?]</span>
         </del> land,
one who could hardly speak the
English language.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir, please deal with me kindly
and let me have my money ($75 50/100)
for I am in need of it. I am willing
to take oath on the fate of my life
that I paid the messenger of the U.S.
Legation at Monrovia Liberia that
money. Please give me justice.
I know you will do what is right
and just. Hoping to hear from you soon.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain, Sir,<br/>
Yours with highest esteem<br/>
Sam'l S. Sevier</p>
