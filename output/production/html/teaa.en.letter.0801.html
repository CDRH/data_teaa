      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
inform the Department that
the work of construction of the
Railway from Loanda to Ambaca,
and styled the Royal Trans-African 
Railway, was inaugurated
on the 31st ultimo by the Governor 
General of the Province, assisted
by the Bishop of Angola and
Congo, and the principal officials
of the Province.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The first sod was cut and
the first stone laid on the site
intended for the construction
of the principal station, by
the Governor General, and a 
religious ceremony calling for
divine blessing on the work 
was

was performed by the Bishop.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The works are commenced
and large numbers of natives
and others employed; and it is
expected the line will be ready
for traffic within the time
mentioned in the contract,
viz: four years.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A vessel with a cargo of
material for constructions is
expected every day from the
states, and most likely as the
work progresses other products
of the United States will be in
requisition.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most obedient servant<br/>
Robt S. Newton<br/>
