      <p class="tei_p">Hon. J. R. Doolittle<br/>
U.S. Senate</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your communication, enclosing
also one from the Hon Sec. of State, the
substance of which is an offer, to me, of the
Commercial Agency at Monrovia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Without hesitancy, and with
sincere gratitude, I avail myself of this
offer, and beg leave, through you, to convey
to the Department of State, my prompt
and cheerful acceptance thereof.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I do not see why this opening
of providence should not lead me into a 
field which will, at once, incite a more 
rigourous, constant, and laudable activity
of the noble attributes of the soul, and
a more healthy exercise of the generous
impulses of the heart.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">When duly commissioned I shall 
hope to repair to my post of duty with a
deep and steady purpose to aid in
developing the resources of the young,
struggling, but growing Republic;
and if approved for diligence, fidelity,
and competency, I may be permitted
to indulge the hope that if an opportunity
occurs for promotion I shall
not be overlooked or forgotten.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I cannot deny myself the
privilege of presenting to you my unfeigned
thanks for the interest which 
you have taken in my case, especially
amidst your multifarious cares and
labors– and to the Hon Sec of 
State for the very considerate manner
in which he has referred to me.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to Remain<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
Abm Hanson</p>
