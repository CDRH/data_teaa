      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to

      <p class="tei_p">Herewith you will find
enclosed my temporary

the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the position until the
next United States
Minister is appointed
and then I will send
a satisfactory bond.
The late Minster
Moses A. Hopkins was 
buried during the rainy 
season and I could
not then have his grave
properly fixed at that
time, but since the 
beginning of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">dries[?]</span>
I have had it so done
in the usual common
way we fix our graves
to prevent it from
sinking under the heavy
rains. I had a stone &amp;
vault

<span class="hr"> </span>

vault built over it which
cost twenty-five dollars
($25.00) at the expense 
of the Legation. I could
not bare see the grave
of an American citizen
in a dilapidated
condition under such
grand government as 
the United States,
therefore I took the work 
upon myself to have 
it fixed. Hoping my 
undertaking will meet
your approval and 
the Department States</p>
