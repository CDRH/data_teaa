      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your circulars of Octo. 
8th '53, March 15th &amp; September 18th 54 more received since
my return from St. Paul de Loanda at which Port I
have the honor of acting as U.S. Commercial Agent. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">On my arrival I addressed the department to
that effect &amp; now advise you of my intended return 
to that port which will probably take place about
the 28th or 30th inst.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As many of the Queries in the
Circular of Octo 8th 53 &amp; Interrogatories of March 15th
'54 cannot be answered by me at the present time. I
am compelled to postpone my answer until my
return to Loanda. I much regret that I am
unable to give the desired information previous to
the close of the year 1854, but on my arrival at
Loanda I will give it my earliest attention &amp;
forward by first opportunity.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Accompaning this I forward to your
Department the Returns of the Coml Agency at
the Port of St. Paul de Loanda ending June 30 '54.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir, very Respectfully<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
