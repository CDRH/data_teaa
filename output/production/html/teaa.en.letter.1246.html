      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor,
to say, that in my
dispatch No. 4, Consular Series,
Sept. 19, 1898, I endeavored
to setforth the deplorable
condition and
suffering of the late J. C. Todd's
children, late of Minneappolis;
now in Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I appealed to the
Department, if possible,
for permission to send
the said 4 children,
back to America. In this,
I desire to say that
while writing my
dispatch

<span class="hr"> </span>

dispatch,. No. 28, Diplomatic
Series, Sept. 22, 1898, it
suggested itself to me,
that should the Department
see fit to send
a Cruiser out here in
December, next, with the
expectation of returning,
direct to America, that
by order of the Department,
that would be
the cheapest and most
direct way of having 
said children returned
to America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to be your obedient servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith</p>
