Sept. 8/87.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hon Thos F Bayard<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I received a
letter from the Treasury Department
informing me that I was due the
Government of the U.S. for service as
Vice Consul General of the U.S. at
Monrovia Liberia $337.27.

<span class="hr"> </span>

Your Government charged me for the
burial expenses of Moses A. Hopkins that I am
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">willing[?]</span> to bear. Your Government also
charge me for paying a bill of Mrs.
E. J. Harmon of Cape Palmas after telling
me to do so. Please look over your
consular series and you will see
where the Department told me to do what
Minister Smyth and Hopkins
did not do. The bill due Mrs Harmon
was $48. and some cents and I paid
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">in[?]</span> the U.S. draft. Your Government
also charged me $30.00 which I
paid the U.S. Messenger who could not

<span class="hr"> </span>

give me a voucher; because he
could not write his name.
but you remember Moses Hopkins
wrote you a Despatch about the
messenger–stating that the boy could
not write his name? The messenger
could not write–that is the reason I
could not send in a voucher for
the $30.00 charged against me. I am
now in the U.S. and I have no hopes
of meeting the messenger again to
get even a cross mark from him.
Again I wish the U.S. government to
remember I was in a position of

<span class="hr"> </span>
 
which I was unacquainted with
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">the[?]</span> rules and regulations they allowed.
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">The[?]</span> messenger has been paid and I
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">pray[?]</span> you in behalf of what I have lost
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">in[?]</span> carrying on the U.S. business at
Monrovia Liberia that I be rewarded.
Your Government also charged against
me $30.50 drawen in favor of Moore
&amp; Sons. The State Department has voucher
for that. Allow me to call the State
Department to certain facts.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">There[?]</span> were many small items to be
paid at the U.S. Legation at Monrovia
for which I could not draw a

<span class="hr"> </span>

draft for G. Moore &amp; Sons paid these
small items and at the end of the
quarter I would always pay them in
draft; that is the reason they would
would also give me voucher including
messenger &amp;c.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">May the 7th 1887 the Department of State
charged against me $20.00 which I
paid out for wine. Now Sir–Indeed
I could not prevent from drawing
that $20.00 on the Department. The
election of the Government of Liberia
was over and the people of that
place were going around visiting

<span class="hr"> </span>

the Consular officials of the various governments 
and the officials were giving
them a treat and I did the same;
that is the reason the $20.00 is against
me.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is I think useless to write further.
Out-side of the $95.85 for burial expenses
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">for[?]</span> Moses A. Hopkins I think the
Government of the U.S. should pay
me for what I have done at my
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">best[?]</span> in its behalf. I was a servant
of the Presbyterian church in that
far off country and I did not

<span class="hr"> </span>

seek the position; but <del>si</del> being
acquainted with Moses A Hopkins
and knowing he was in a place
unknown <del>to him</del> I thought I would
be of use to him therefore I took the
position and even held it long
before ever receiving a certificate of
recognition as Vice Consul Genl from
your peer; therefore how now can
your Government be so exact on
me after laboring under many
disadvantages in its behalf?
I pray your government give me
what due me. I know you 
will consider my case as I have

<span class="hr"> </span>

state <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">here[?]</span>. Please do all you
can for me. I am not going back
to Liberia; so I will not be able to
give you any vouchers.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hoping you will do justice to my
case–and hoping to hear from
you soon</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain<br/>
Dear Sir<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
Samuel S. Sevier<br/>
