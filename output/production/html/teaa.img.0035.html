  <p>This is an image of James Robert Spurgeon in his full masonic regalia. Born in Kentucky in 1870, Spurgeon served as Secretary of the American Legation to Liberia between 1898 and 1902. Graduating from Yale Law School in 1892, he opened a law office in Maysville, Kentucky, before being appointed by President McKinley to serve. Although he was not sure what to expect when he left the United States, upon arrival, he noted, "I like the country much better than I thought I would. The people here are quite American in their habits, manners, etc. The government is modeled after that of the United States and the officials are dignified and intelligent." (<em>Daily Public Ledger</em>, Kentucky, August 15 1898.) Spurgeon's tenure was rather turbulent, and he was eventually relieved of his duties, but remained in Liberia until 1907. In 1903, he was reported to have taken up the position of superintendent of public instruction in Liberia.</p>

<p>An avid mason, Spurgeon dedicated a lecture given to the Liberian lodge to Prince Hall. He had joined the lodge in Liberia immediately on arrival. As a diplomat in Liberia, like many of his African American counterparts, he lobbied on behalf of the African nation. In 1904, he was said to have "always enjoyed a merited confidence of the people of Monrovia, and although an American citizen and representative, he is as much a Liberian in social life as any other man, yet he never acts in a way to compromise his Government. For this reason he is hated by certain American Negro citizens." (<em>Liberia</em>, February 1903.) Spurgeon had a long and interesting career after his tenure in Liberia. In 1907, upon his return to the United States, he was named Prince Hall Past Master by Affiliation of Carthaginian No. 47 (Brooklyn, New York). In 1910, he was said to have founded the first Black Boy Scouts troop in Brooklyn. Spurgeon continued to practice law in New York, where he died in 1942.</p>
