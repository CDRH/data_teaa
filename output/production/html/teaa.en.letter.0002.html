      <p class="tei_p">Hon. Wm. L. Marcy<br/>
Secretary of State U.S.A.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have this day drawn
on you in favor of Eliza Willis of Salem Mass for
Twenty-eight &amp; 93/100 dollars, being the amount paid
by me for Flagstaff &amp;c as per Bill which accompanies
the draft. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have not yet sent the Bond, owing to my
request to be appointed Consul instead of "Coml Agent"
(as per to my Letter of Jany 12th via England) for this Port,
presuming if I received the appointment of Consul
it might require a different Bond.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Trusting the
request previously alluded to will receive your kind
attention.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain<br/>
Yours Very Respectfully<br/>
John G. Willis</p>
