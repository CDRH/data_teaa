      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to report to the Department
that a Portuguese Expedition under the command of
Henriques de Carvalho, Chefe, Major in the Portugese Army 
Sezenande Marquis sub chefe, Major in the Health Department
and Manoel Sertorio d'Aquiar Lieutenant in the Portugese Army
left here on the 10th instant in the "Serpa Pinto" for Dondo in
the Quanza River where they hope to arrange carriers
to enable them to proceed. Their principal destination being to 
visit the King of Muata-Janvo one of the most important
potentates in the interior of this part of Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">They take a large quantity of goods and will
require about 500 carriers which they hope to
arrange at Malange. I believe they take important
presents from the King of Portugal to the King of
Muata-Janvo. It is announced in the official paper
of this Province that the Expedition is allowed Rs 19,320,000
for its expenses being a little over Â£4000. Their intention is 
to open up the Muata-Janvo country to commerce and
afterwards cross over to Mozambique. The journey is
calculated to occupy about 2 years.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
