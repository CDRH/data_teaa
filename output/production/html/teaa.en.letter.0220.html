      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
Zanzibar, August 15th, 1886</p>
      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon<br/>
Third Assist. Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to request the
Department of State to inform me
if any allowance will be made me
for making the new treaty with the
Sultan of Zanzibar.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I consider that such work is
outside of the line of a Consul's duty
and it made a great deal of extra
work and trouble, as is always the
case in these Oriental countries.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Treaty was to be got through
in a great hurry and it was only
from my being as any old friend of
the Sultan's that it was finished
in as short a time.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The salary of this Consulate 
is only $1000 per annum and I
consider that $500 would be a fair
recompense for my outside work on this 
new treaty.</p>
      <span class="hr">Â </span>
      <p class="tei_p">My address in the United States
is c/o Messrs. Arnold, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Hines[?]</span> &amp; Co.<br/>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">158[?]</span> Water St.<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, Sir<br/>
Your Obedient Servant,<br/>
F. M. Cheney<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
