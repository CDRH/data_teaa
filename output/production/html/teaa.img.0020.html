<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Mohun's sketch of this "Arab" house calls attention to the "round holes in the walls to shoot from." As Mohun explained in his June 21, 1893, despatch, the Belgians had launched a campaign against local Arabs, many of whom were slave traders. Presumably, the holes were to help the resident Arabs defend against imminent Belgian attacks. While Mohun does not mention this outright, the recently ratified <a href="teaa.en.government.0002">Brussels Conference Act of 1890</a> pledged the signatories to stamping out slavery across Africa. Much of Mohun's despatch, accompanied by sketches and maps, focused on the Congo Free State's expeditions to suppress the slave trade in Central Africa, targeting "Arab Slave dealers."</p>
