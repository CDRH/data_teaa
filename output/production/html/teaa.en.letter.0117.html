at St Paul de Loanda, 21st Feby. 1879</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
receipt of your Despatch No 71 in reference
to my request for leave of absence. I 
thank the Department for the leave granted
for 6 month &amp; will advise the same
on my departure from this Post.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Thomas the newly appointed
Consul has not yet arrived and 
should he fail to reach this Port before
my departure I shall hand the Archives
over to the charge of Mr A.G. Colville
during my absence.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I take due note that
Mr Thomas has been furnished with
the new seal &amp; press requested in my
Despatch No 27.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The mail steamer "La
Plata from Lisbon due here in the beginning 
of January last has not yet arrived
and although two steamers with later
dates

Washington, D.C.</span>



dates have since come into Port, they 
give no news of her so there is little
doubt but in what she is lost or that 
something serious has happened 
to her. It is to be hoped that Consul 
Thomas was not on board of her.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most obedient Servt.<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
