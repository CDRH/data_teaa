honor to transmit herewith
a "Report on the production
of Crude India Rubber" in the 
Province of Angola and
its dependencies.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The delay in forwarding
it is owing to want of quick
communication with the
sources of information, and 
certain difficulty in getting
at statistics.</p>

Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Ed Bannister<br/>
Vice Consul.</p>
