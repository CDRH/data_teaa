      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you, this 
Office has had no Flag since my appointment 
as Consul and that we have for the past three 
months been using one belonging to the 
American Bark "Tropic Bird" and as this 
vessel haves this port in a day or so the 
Captain has asked me to return his Flag. 
Will you please instruct the Department of 
State to furnish us with a moderate sized 
Flag or two &amp; oblige.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most Obedient Servant<br/>
