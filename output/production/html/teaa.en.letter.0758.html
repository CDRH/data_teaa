      <p class="tei_p">Antananarivo,<br/>
27th August, 1886.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We have just heard a rumour
to the effect that one of the Powers having
Treaty rights with Madagascar has instructed
its Consul in Madagascar to apply for his
Exequatur through the medium of the French
Resident General, or to receive the same from
him.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Should such be the case there is evidently
a misunderstanding with reference to the
Franco-Malagasy Treaty of the 17th December,
1885, and its Appendix of January 9th, 1886.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am convinced that your Government
is aware that the afore-said Treaty does
not in the slightest degree interfere with the
Treaty concluded between your Government
and Madagascar. The French Government
were also of that opinion when they wrote
on

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To
The Secretary of State
of the United States of America<br/>
Washington</span>
         <span class="hr">Â </span>

on the 27th of December, 1885, to their Ambassador
in Washington, requesting him to
inform the United States' Government
of the new Treaty.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In consequence of the good friendship
at present existing between our two Governments,
I feel that it is only right that
I should inform you that any request
like the above made by the Consul of
any Power having Treaty rights with
Madagascar is a breach of the Treaty
made with us, and we have positively
determined not to recognise the official
status of any Consul who may endeavour
to obtain his Exequatur through the
medium of the French Resident General.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">May God bless you, Sir,<br/>
Saith your friend<br/>
(Signed) Rainilaiarivony 
Prime Minister</p>
