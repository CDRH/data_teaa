Asst Secty of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose herewith the Doctor's
certificate ordering me to go further North or
South to improve my health, which has 
been, I must confess, very bad indeed for
over three months. It seems that I cannot 
live here much longer if I do not change
air: Consequently I would most respectfully
request of the State Department, leave of 
absence for at least two or three months;
in the meantime I would state that if
able, will certainly take note of what 
may be useful to Am: commerce.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">My wife who accompanied me to this forlorn
place leaves for the U.S. by next steamer,
as it is impossible to keep her here any
longer.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
L. de R. du Verge<br/>
US Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I do hereby certify that his Excel-
lence La de R. du Verge, Consul of 
the United States of America in this
City, suffers almost continually from
the marshy fevers of this region
of country the results of which is
finding himself highly affected
with anemia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I therefore consider that it
would be very beneficial for Mr
du Verge to leave this city for
some time, seeking other more
healthy localities on the Coast of
Africa where he can recover himself 
and regenerate new blood.</p>
