      <p class="tei_p">Hon. F. W. Seward<br/>
Asst Secty of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir, your letter dated the 18th inst, received.
In reply, I beg to state that I am now en route
via Liverpool England, to St Paul De Loanda, my
next letter to you will be dated from that Port,
though I must inform you that the passage money
alone, will exceed one fourth of the consular salary
for the current year.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">My departure, hitherto, has been delayed
by an illness of some duration, and
I await confirmation by the senate, though I 
have not been idle, I have secured the cooperation
of a number of merchants in Boston and New York
in the African Trade, and as a direct result
three vessels with <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> cargoes have been
sent to St Paul De Loanda with orders to bring
back African goods from that Port. More 
vessels will follow, and the indication

<span class="hr">Â </span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>, that a number of vessels, heretofore
engaged in the Cape, and South East African
Trade, will find their way up the west
coast, and that, St Paul De Loanda will be
the leading Port of Trade with the United States
on the south west coast, over one hundred 
thousand Dollars have been received for commercial
purposes at and around this Port.
I will write at length of the result of this
enterprise, in the consular dispatches, and
I trust it may be satisfactorily shown
that my presence in this country has 
not been reproductive of good, to both countries
especially in stimulating trade with the Port
to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">which[?]</span> I was assigned.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Leave here tomorrow, and will spend a
week in England, before taking the Liverpool
steamer for South Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">With thanks for your kindness, and 
with the highest consideration of respect.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am very truly your obedient Servant<br/>
William H Thomas<br/>
United States Consul<br/>
St Paul de Loanda <br/>
Africa</p>
