      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate,<br/>
Loanda, 16 June 1890.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honble James G. Blaine<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Newton, the Vice Consul
at this port, having informed me
that he will probably not return to 
Africa for some time, I have the 
honour to submit to you my application
for the appointment.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was acting Vice Consul for a few
months during the year 1887, have
been in charge again since the 15th
of August of last year, and have
at different times assisted Mr. Newton
during his incumbency, and thus 
gained a knowledge of the duties of
the office.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been in Mr. Newton's
employ several years, and as he
has been favorably known to the
Department for a period extending
over twenty years, I have no doubt
his endorsement of my application



will have due influence with you.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My bond already exists in the
Department, but if necessary I
can have a new one duly executed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Trusting to receive a favorable
reply.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I, am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Ed Bannister.<br/>
Acting Vice Consul</p>
