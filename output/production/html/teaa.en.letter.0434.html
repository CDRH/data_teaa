      <p class="tei_p">Subject: The office of Vice Commercial agent at Sierra Leone</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Upon the nomination of H. Rider, formerly
Commercial Agent at Sierra Leone Mr. J. B. 
Upton was appointed Vice Commercial Agent 
on February 20 1871 and the usual certificate 
was issued. Mr Upton writes from Sierra Leone
March 30, 1871, ackg. the receipt of notice of appt., 
and says that the condition of his health compels
him to have for America where he will fill his
bond. He reports his arrival at New York 
on August 29, 1871, and that he had left Mr. 
Wm Hogan in charge of the office. He has 
not informed the Department of his return to his
post nor of his intention to return.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Upon Mr. Hogan's appointment his commission 
was made out as Consul; He made 
no nomination for Vice Consul, but on 
leaving his past he states (August 7, 1873) that
Mr. Nathaniel Lyons will be left in change. 
This dispatch was ordered "filed", and no 
action was taken. When Mr. Hogan 
was appointed Consul, the name of Mr. 
Upton as V.C.A. should, I think, have
