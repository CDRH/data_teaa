      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt-
Oct., 13, of your No. 23, of
Sept., 2, 1899; advising
that I vacate the present
premises, used as United
States Legation- Monrovia;
provided the administrator
Hon., R. H. Jackson, will
not sink a well on the
said premises.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In reply, I beg to say,
I have just, yesterday,
succeeded in having
an interview with Senator
Jackson, relative to
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the advice of the Department.
He says it is not
practiceable to sink a well,
on the said premises, owing
to the rocky foundation,
and the want of proper
machinery for drilling &amp;c.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">He says he prefers that
the United States, shall
have the use of the said
premises, but if it will
not retain the use, thereof,
without the sinking of a
well, it will have to vacate.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Owing to the scarcity
of respectable and well
situated property that can be
rented, I think it best not
to hurry out. It is possibly
probable that I can more
equally as good quarters,
with a well on the premises,
for about the same,
rent, though not as desirably
situated, in about a twelve
months

<span class="hr"> </span>

months time.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
your obedient servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
M. R. and C. General.</p>
