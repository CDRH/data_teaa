Assistant Secretary of States<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose
herewith Exchance voucher, (Form 
No. 92.), being <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">cost[?]</span> of local currency 
when bought by money of the
United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In connection with the above I 
would state that it is very difficult
to negotiate consular drafts here. No
parties in Loanda doing business
with the United States, and I am
informed that if in the future I 
wish to dispose of my drafts a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">higher[?]</span>
rate of exchange will be charged.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Henry F. Downing, Consul</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Enclosures.</p>
