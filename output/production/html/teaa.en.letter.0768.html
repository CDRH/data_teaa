      <p class="tei_p">Mr. George Strickland<br/>
To the Department of State.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Subject:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Reaction in Public Opinion concerning the "Fez
affair" before treated of in Numbers 70, 71, &amp; 73.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Abstract of Contents:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"Fez" people will probably be found principally in
the right. Notification of quarantine was not
given until nine o'clock on the night of the 7.
The British Vice-Consul, and Agent of the Mail-Steamers
generally condemned; the more especially
for not having allowed Mr. Taylor on board the one
which passed the 8 October. Mr. Taylor supposed 
at first to be inculpated with the others for 
disrespectful language but the contrary now conceded.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
Goree-Dakar, November 21, 1887.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Honorable James D. Porter<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg to state with reference to my despatches
numbered 70, 71, &amp; 73, on the "Fez affair",
that the inquest held thereon has been exhaustive,
and though the result is not yet known the
natural reaction in public sentiment has set in;
and I have reason to believe that the "Fez" people
will be found principally in the right.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As for the quarantine it is now known
that the notification was not given until nine
o'clock on the night of the 7th, which was after
the passengers had been on shore. The Captain
of the Port at Dakar will probably be severely
censured. Mr. Restoul, the British Vice-Consul, is
generally condemned and particularly for his 
refusal to allow the Honorable Mr. Taylor
on board the Mail-Steamer of which he had
the control. It is probable, however, that so
far as the British government is concerned, it
will, following its traditions, uphold its functionary.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">Following hearsay at the time of
the incident, Mr. Taylor was among those who
were disrespectful to the authorities, but now
that people have found out something of what
actually occurred, it is conceded that on the
contrary, he was quite gentlemanly.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I understand that Mr. Cleret, the
Delegate of the Interior, sees his mistake and
regrets the hasty letter in which he blamed
me for not covering with an envelope Captain
Kent's letter to him.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Believe me, Sir, respectfully,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
George Strickland<br/>
Vice-Consul.</p>
