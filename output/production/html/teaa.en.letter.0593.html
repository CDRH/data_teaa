      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States
at Bathurst 11th August 1859</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose 
herewith The Quarterly
Return of Arrivals &amp; Departures
of American vessels for the Quarter
ending the 30th of June last
also The Quarterly Return of 
Fees for the same period amounting 
to sixty two Dollars and fifty 
six cents.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">You will also find herewith 
a copy of the Treaty between
France and England relative 
to Portendie and Albreda, and the 
free navigation of the Gambia, conceded 
to France by the latter power.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have indirectly learned
that Her Majesty's Government
has sent a Despatch to the present
    
<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">Honorable Lewis Cass<br/>
Secretary of State of the United States<br/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<br/>
Washington</span>
    
         <span class="hr"> </span>   
    
Acting Governor of these settlements
the Contents of which are to this 
purpose, that, the Home Government 
experienced many difficulties 
in regard to the right of 
free navigation of the Gambia 
accorded to the French, from the 
Powers with whom England has
treaties with the "most favored
nation" clause; that it could be 
agreeable to the Home Government 
to have the opening of the 
river to the whole world made 
the subject of a petition from the 
Colonists.</p>    
    
      <p class="tei_p">I am inclined to believe that 
the Colonists, particularly the Commercial 
part of the community 
are opposed to this scheme, as
they also were to the opening of 
the River to the French, and 
but to little purpose.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The advantages to the desired
from the force navigation of the 
Gambia, as far as the United
States are concerned, are at
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

present, perhaps, unimportant.
But I am convinced that the 
future will tend to increase
those advantages.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The river is navigable to vessels 
drawing not more than eight 
feet of water as far as Mc'
Carthy's Island, the principal
British settlement, and about 
two hundred miles above this.
The principal articles of produce 
procured in the River are
Ground Nuts (Pea Nuts), of
which the annual export for 
the past year was 15,728 tons;
requiring a considerable 
amount of shipping to bring
them here to market.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">About 70,000 Hides and 100 tons
of Beeswax exported in the same 
period of time.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">This carrying trade is now performed 
by British vessels almost
entirely. Most of the French 
vessels being too large or drawing 
too much wake to ascend    
    
<span class="hr"> </span>
    
the river to any distance.
American vessels from their 
peculiarly flat build and 
large deck capacity are better
adapted than either British or 
French for this carrying trade.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The River trade as at 
present carried on is not a very
profitable one. There are Eight
English &amp; three French Houses
engaged in it from this port.
Prices obtained for goods, in 
the River, are large and remunerative,
but the disadvantages
and losses arise 1st. From 
employing native Mundingos
(in whose language there appears
to be no such word as honesty)
for traders. 2d From the number 
of small vessels required to bring 
the produce to town, the expense
of which, increases very considerably
the price of the produce.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">It has occurred to me that this
matter would be worthy the consideration 
of the United States
    
<span class="hr"> </span>
    
and that perhaps the present 
would be favorable moment
for bringing it before Her Majesty's
Government.</p>    
    
      <p class="tei_p">Should it be the wish of the Department 
I should be glad upon the 
return of the healthy season
commencing in November or 
December to ascend the River
as far as Mc'Carthy's Island
and make a report thereon.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I regret that my present
state of health requires a chance
of climate and ascending to the 
order of my medical man I 
shall be obliged to leave my Consulate 
for the coming two months 
and proceed to the Island of 
Teneriffe.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I have appointed 
Mr. Richard Charles Lloyd Acting 
Consul during my absence.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
