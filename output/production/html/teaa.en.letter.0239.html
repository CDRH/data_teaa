      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been permitted to read the reply of John E. Taylor, 
U.S. Consul at Sierra Leone, now on file in your Department, 
to a complaint made against him, by me, for conniving to 
defraud the United States.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He admits the substantial facts charged by me, but 
endeavors, with great circumlocution, to convince you 
of his innocency in the transaction,â€”an attempt in which 
I think he has signally failed. He has not even 
the manliness to acknowledge his error, or volunteer 
a regret for his conduct. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">That he is wholly unfit for the place he holds is 
an admitted fact by all I have heard speak upon 
the subject, and I trust his appointment will not 
be forwarded. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Very Respectfully
Your Obt Servt<br/>
J B Danforth Jr.</p>
