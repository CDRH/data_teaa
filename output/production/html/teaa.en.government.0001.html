            <h3>Analysis</h3>

            <p class="tei_p">The General Act of the Berlin Conference was signed on February 26, 1885 at the close of the Berlin Conference of 1884-5. The signatories of the act represented the United States, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, Russia, Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and United Kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. The General Act, once ratified, bound the signatory nations to combating the continental slave trade in Africa, recognizing the sovereignty of the Congo Free State, respecting the protectorates and territorial possessions already present in Africa, and insuring the free navigation of the Congo and Niger Rivers and their tributaries. On the latter point, the Act dictated that railroads, roads, and "lateral canals" connected to the rivers be zones of free commerce and navigation. It made provisions to establish the International Commission of Navigation of the Congo to oversee this. <a href="teaa.en.government.0001" class="tei_ref_type_internal">(See Article 20)</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Additionally, by declaring the free navigation of the Niger, the Act ended the British and French dispute over which nation held sovereignty over the river. The Act also outlined the boundaries of the Congo Basin and committed all signatories to insuring "commercial liberty" in the basin, its embouchures, and its "neighbouring country, and dispositions connected therewith." Accordingly, the Act forbade commercial monopolies in the Congo and prevented "powers" in the region from enacting import and export duties on goods brought into the region for twenty years. Mindful that foreign travel to Africa had increased during the nineteenth century, the Act required the signees to protect "natives," travelers, and missionaries, as well as guarantee "liberty of conscience" and "religious toleration" for these persons. The conference attendees charged each signee to urge their respective governments to ratify the document within one year of its signing. The United States was the only power represented at the conference that did not deposit its ratification with the Berlin Foreign Office by April 1886.<sup>1</sup>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">The General Act, in many ways, recognized what was occurring on in the continent since the early nineteenth century—the incremental penetration of the continent by Europeans, predominantly. This penetration intensified in the 1860s and 1870s with such events as Britain's punitive expedition against Abyssinia (1867-1868), King Leopold's claim to the Congo Free State in 1876, and Henry Morton Stanley's Anglo-American Expedition of 1878, to name a few. The dispute between France and Great Britain over Egypt in the 1880s brought the question of control over Africa to a head. In the immediate years following the signing of the Act and its ratification, European powers solidified their control over West Africa, establishing protectorates with access to the Atlantic coast. While the Act pledged to protect the natives and gave special protection to "[C]hristian missionaries, the savants [scientists], the explorers, their escorts, properties and collections," it became increasingly clear that the European powers aimed to dispossess Africans of their most fertile lands, to mobilize African labor (oftentimes violently) in service of the empire, to force Christianity on Africans, and to decrease the influence of Islam on the continent. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, European imperialist met resistance from African kingdoms, caliphates, states, and acephalous societies. However, by the turn of the twentieth century, most of Africa was under European control with the exception of Liberia and Abyssinia.<sup>2</sup>

      <p class="tei_p">Who, furnished with full powers which have been found in good and
due form, have successively discussed and adopted:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">1st. A Declaration relative to the liberty of commerce in the basin of the Congo, embouchures and neighboring countries, with certain dispositions connected therewith;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2nd. A Declaration concerning the slave trade and the operations which on land or sea furnish slaves for the trade;</p>
   
      <p class="tei_p">3rd. A Declaration relative to the neutrality of the territory comprised in the conventional basin of the Congo;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">4th. An Act of navigation of the Congo, which while taking note of local circumstances, extends to this river, to its affluents and to the Waters which are assimilated to them, the general principles announced in Articles 108 to 116 of the final Act of the Congress of Vienna and designed to regulate between the Powers signatory to said Act, the free navigation of navigable water courses which separate or traverse several States, principles since then conventionally applied to certain rivers of Europe and of America, and notably to the Danube, with the modifications provided by the treaties of Paris of 1856, of Berlin of 1878, and of London of 1871 and of 1883;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">5th. An Act of navigation of the Niger which, While equally taking

      <p class="tei_p">6th. A Declaration introducing into international relations certain

coordinated in a single instrument, have collected them into a general
Act composed of the following articles.</p>


      <div class="chapter">

         <h4>Chapter I.</h4>
         <h4>Declaration Relative to the Liberty of Commerce in the Basin
of the Congo, its Embouchures and Neighboring Country, and
Dispositions Connected Therewith.</h4>

         <div class="article">

            <h5>Article 1.</h5>

            <p class="tei_p">The commerce of all nations shall enjoy complete liberty:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">1st. In all the territories constituting the basin of the Congo and its affluents. This basin is defined by the crests of the contiguous basins, to wit: notably the basins of the Niari, of the Ogove, of the Schari and of the Nile, on the North; by the line of Eastern water shed of the affluents of lake Tanganyka on the East; by the crests of the basins of the Zambeze and of the Loge, on the South. It embraces, consequently, all the territories drained by the Congo and its affluents, including the lake Tanganyka and its Eastern tributaries.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">2nd. In the maritime zone extending along the Atlantic ocean from
the parallel of 2° 30' Southern latitude to the mouth of the Loge.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The Northern boundary shall follow the parallel of 2° 30' from the
coast to the point where it strikes the geographical basin of the Congo,
avoiding the basin of the Ogove to which the stipulations of the present
Act do not apply.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The Southern boundary shall follow the course of the Loge up to the source of this river and shall be directed thence Eastward to the junction of the geographical basin of the Congo.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">3rd. In the zone prolonged to the East of the Congo basin as it is above described, as far as the Indian ocean, from the fifth degree of North latitude to the mouth of the Zambeze on the South; from this point the line of demarcation shall follow the Zambeze to a point five miles above the confluence of the Shire and shall continue by the line of water shed separating the waters which flow towards the lake Nyassa from the waters tributary to the Zambeze to rejoin finally the line dividing the waters of the Zambeze and of the Congo.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is expressly understood that in extending to this Eastern zone the
principle of commercial liberty the Powers represented at the Conference only engage for themselves and that this principle shall apply to territories actually belonging to any independent and sovereign State only
in so far as it shall give its consent thereto. The Powers agree to employ their good offices with the governments established upon the African
littoral of the Indian ocean in order to obtain such consent and, in
every case, to assure to the transit of all nations the most favorable conditions.</p>

         </div>

         <div class="article">

            <h5>Article 2.</h5>

there empty into the sea, to all the waters of the Congo and its affluents
including the lakes, to all the ports situated upon the borders of these
waters, as well as to all the canals which may in the future be excavated
with the object of connecting together the water courses or lakes comprised in the whole extent of the territories described in Article 1. They

this head, must be equally borne by the allegiants and by strangers of
every nationality.</p>

merchandise.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">All Powers exercising rights of sovereignty or an influence in the
Said territories engage themselves to watch over the conservation of

slavery and especially of the negro slave trade; they shall protect and

vessels, loaded or in ballast, of all nations, as well for the transport of
merchandise as for that of travelers. It must conform itself to the
dispositions of the present navigation Act and to the regulations to be
