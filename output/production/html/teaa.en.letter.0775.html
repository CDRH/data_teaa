      <div class="note">Number 133</div>

      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar<br/>
March 6th 1891</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/>
William F Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In my Dispatch to the Department,
No 128. I took occasion to point out
that the new duties levied here
might prove quite unfavorable to
the interests of American Commerce.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At the date of the Dispatch
however I had conferred with no
American party on the subject, and
the remarks made were simply a
reflection of my own judgment in the
matter. But a few days later I 
received a letter from the Agent of
the American firm from Portland, Maine,
lately established in St Louis, on the 
last page of which he casually mentioned
how the new duties were already affecting
his trade. I have sent and obtained
permission to use this last half sheet
which you will please find enclosed.
The last paragraph contains the summing



up of his views on the subject of 
the duties. The senior member of this 
firm in question is now on his way 
here to look into the condition of
things as lately developed by the duties,
and in the present temper of his <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">agency[?]</span>
it would seem that the business,
established in the beginning with
considerable expense, may not be of
long continuance. Other American
parties have communicated to me
their discouragements, but some of 
them will doubtless keep on until
a change for the better appears
entirely out of the Question.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It would not be so bad if this 
unlooked for check to the business
affected only the few shipowners who <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">run[?]</span>
vessels here. The furnishers of goods "expressly
for this market" are now numerous
throughout the West, and in fact are
represented in most sections of the
United States.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am esteemed Sir<br/>
Very truly Yours<br/>
Peter Strickland<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
