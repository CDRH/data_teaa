      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Consulate at
Sierra Leone Sept 30th 1880.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon. John Hay<br/>
Ass't Secretary State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to report to the Department regarding
a great meeting between the Sierra Leone
Government and the Queens, Kings, 
and Chiefs of the Timneh Country
and their followers, held at Government
House on the 17th Instant,
to conclude and sign a Treaty of
Peace, which by the mediation of
some of them, His Excellency
the Administrator in Chief had
undertaken to effect among them
all, Chiefly for the settlement of
the Quiah War and also to secure
from future disturbance by
native wars, the territories adjacent
and forming the highway to
Sierra

<span class="hr"> </span>

Sierra Leone for the trade of the
interior.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A preliminary meeting had been
held at the Court Hall at which
the terms of the Treaty had been fully
discussed by the Chiefs among
themselves, so that the work of Friday
afternoon, consisted in the final
act of signing, after due explanation
of the terms of the Treaty
already agreed to.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The meeting at the Government House
which was held on the Eastern 
Lawn was attended by about
three hundred (300) Chiefs and followers.
His Excellency the Administrator-in chief
and Staff together with
Officers of the Regiment and invited
officials to the number of about
Seventy five (75) were in attendance
in uniform or full evening dress,
some of whose names appear
below as having witnessed the
ceremony of the signing of the
Treaty of Peace</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">The meeting which was one of the
largest of the kind every witnessed
in Sierra Leone, was very imposing. 
The Band of the 1st West India Regt.
was present, and a guard of honor
of about two hundred (200) troops
of the same Regiment, carrying their
colors, arms with fixed bayonets
were so placed upon the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
esplanaid on the north side, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">that[?]</span> they
not only added effect to the scene
but must have impressed the
assembled chiefs, that with the
ready disposition of British power
to seek for and make peace, its capacity
for war was also unbounded.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The meeting having been <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">opened[?]</span>
His Excellency the Administrator-in Chief
made to the Queens, Kings, Chiefs
and their followers an address which
was interpreted to them in the Timneh
language by Mr. T. G. Lawson,
Government Interpreter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">His Excellency in addressing them
said, that he had very little
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to say to them as he had already
had two interviews, with them and 
he had heard what they had said
in the Court Hall.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He had seen Lahie Bundoo and
Gbannah Sehrey shake hands
and had heard a universal desire
expressed for peace.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">They had asked him to make an
agreement, which they should all 
sign before him, so as to peace on
record this desire. This he had
done and they had already had it read
and explained to them, and they said it
was the expression of their <del>desire</del> wish.
He said he had asked a great
many officers and gentlemen to be
present at the signing of this agreement
and if any of themselves
should forget what they signed that
day, they might be sure that he
and his officers and friends would
not do so.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He believed from what he had
heard from them, that they had not 
come

<span class="hr"> </span>

come for play, but were sincere
in their desire for peace; and if this
was so they and their children after
them would be glad they had signed 
that instrument, but it would be an
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> day for any one who made light
of it. They saw the soldiers that
were present, but the officer who
was sitting by him, had many more 
up the hill and at other places on
the coast. They had been to
Quiah: but he trusted they would
never go there again in that way.
The wish of the British was to see peace
and to teach the natives how to become
prosperous.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">His Excellency asked Bey Mauro
King of the North Bullom, how many
people they met at Benkia, when 
he accompanied them there some
time ago, during the war, and
he replied none. he then asked
how many were there now, and 
he replied plenty, the country was
peopled again.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">His Excellency said this was the
effect of Peace and that if they
continued peaceful, their country
would soon become rich, through
the security which their crop and
all their property would enjoy.
He expressed the hope, that he
would shortly have the pleasure
of seeing their people, again in
Sierra Leone not as now, to be
talking of war, or even to be making
peace, but to be trading 
together and enjoying the fruits
of the present peace, which he
trusted would be permanent.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At the request of His
Excellency the Colonial Secretary
read and Mr Lawson interpreted
the Treaty which is written below.
All the Chiefs having expressed
that they understood and agreed
to the terms thereof the Treaty was
signed and witnessed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The following is the
Treaty</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Treaty.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We the undersigned Queens, Kings
and Chiefs of our respective
countries, being met together
at Government House Sierra
Leone, desire to record and do
hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Whereas wars have for some
time since been raging, in the Quiah
Country, whereby said country has
been impoverished, and the inhabitants
driven away: and
Whereas, such wars have been
mainly carried on by or at the
instigation of Gbannah Sehrey 
a chief under Bome Rufa and
Bome Warrah, Queens of the Quiah
Country in disobedience to the
command of such Queens:
and whereas Lahai Bundoo another
chief under the said Queens, has
also recently been engaged in war
with the said Gabannah Sehrey
whereby the Quiah Country has been
devastated: and whereas
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the said Gabannah Sehrey and
Lahai Bundoo, have expressed
their sincere regret, for their past
conduct, and the said Gbannah 
Sehrey has particularly inticated the
Administrator in Chief of the West
Africa Settlements to convey to her
Most Gracious Majesty Queen
Victoria his penitence for having
insulted His Excellency Sir Samuel
Rowe K.C.M.G. Governor in Chief
of the West Africa Settlements by
attacking Bey Sherboro King of
Yonnie and his Chiefs and attendants,
when on their way to a
peaceful mission to the said
Governor-in-Chief; and the said
Lahai Bundoo has begged to be
forgiven, for renewing disturbance
in the Quiah Country, after His
Excellency the Governor in Chief had
at great expense, and personal
exertion left such Country in
quiet: and</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Whereas Seckoo Camarah,

<span class="hr"> </span>

Alikarlie of Port Lokkoh and
Boccary Bombolie are alleged to
have encouraged Gabannah Sehrey
in making war and thus disturbing
the peace of the country: and
whereas great damage to life and
property has been occasioned
by the late and previous wars:
and whereas the Administrator in
Chief of the West Africa Settlements
has been interceeded by Bey Mauro
King of North Bullom and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Allimamy[?]</span>
Sannassi Chief of Medina, Bullom
Shose as mediators on behalf of the
said Lahai Bundoo, Gabannah
Sehrey, Seckoo Camarah and Boccary
Bombalito allow them to make peace
in the presence of himself, as the present
representative in Sierra Leone of Her
Most Gracious Majesty Queen
Victoria and in the presence of the
various officers and persons whose
names are attached as witnesses
hereto and to place on record in the
most solemn manner their promise 
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to keep the peace forever hereafter
towards one another and all other
peaceful chiefs and people: and
whereas the various other Queens,
Kings, and Chiefs signing this agreement
have expressed their
earnest wish to take the present
opportunity of entering into an
agreement for peace and also
for submission of any disputes
which may hereafter arise between
them to the decission of the Governor-in-Chief
of the West Africa Settlements.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Now being convinced that no
country can be prosperous, whose
inhabitants, can not enjoy in
security the fruits of their labor
we wish to take such measures
as shall secure amongst us
a lasting peace, feeling that as
people of one <del>country</del> nation many
of whom are joined together by ties
of marriage and blood relationship,
it is fitting that we should live together
in amity, our interest being the
same

<span class="hr"> </span>

same, and having no real hatred
one against another, knowing
also that if we can succeed
in subduing these tribal feuds in
which our children are taken
prisoners in large numbers and
sold as slaves, to a slavery
from which many of their never
return, we shall be stronger as
a united people, and better able to
progress in civilization and
wealth.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With a view to procure this result
we the undersigned Queens, Kings
Chiefs, and people and people
who have set our names
to this agreement, hereby make
peace and solemnly promise,
for ourselves and our successors
to keep the same, and to submit
such disputes, as may hereafter
arise between us and them, and
as can not be settled by our general
assembly, to the arbitration of the
Governor of Sierra Leone or of such
fitting

<span class="hr"> </span>

officer as shall be by him
appointed to undertake that
duty, if the Governor will consent
to act in the matter, and we
promise that we will abide
by his award or that of the officer
appointed by him.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We pledge ourselves that should
any of us, refuse to abide by his
decission or that of the officer
appointed by him, and have 
recourse to war in opposition to
it. That we will uphold the
decission of His Excellency the
Governor or of such officer
appointed by him to act for him
and that we will consider any
person refusing to abide by such
decission, to be a common enemy
to the whole of us, and we will 
if requested by the Governor of Sierra 
Leone hand over any such
person to him in order that he may
be removed from our country
and be dealt with by the Governor

<span class="hr"> </span>

by imprisonment or otherwise in
any such way as shall seem to
him to be good.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We request the Governor to take this
responsibility and thus aid us in
maintaining peace in our country;
for although we know we have 
nothing to give in return for this,
yet we feel from the interest that
Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen of England has been graciously
pleased to take in our welfare, and
from the council given to us by
Her officer, that the Governor
will still be willing to help us in this
which we believe is the right way to
ensure peace among us.</p>
