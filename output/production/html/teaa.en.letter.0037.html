      <p class="tei_p">Washington Sept 1, 1862</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Several Months since I received
a Note from Mr S A Andrews stating that he
was appointed US Commercial Agent for the 
Port of St Paul 'd Loanda.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Within the past week 
I have received Letters from Mr Cunningham who 
has been acting during my absence &amp; as he does not 
mention anything about the arrival of Mr Andrews 
I presume Mr C continued in charge of the Office 
&amp; that Mr Andrews had not accepted the appointment.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I propose to return within Fifteen or 
Twenty days to my Post &amp; will thank you for
the Requisite Passport.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Should it be the pleasure of the Department
I should be glad to continue to hold the
office which I have held to several years past
as I believe to the satisfaction of the Department 
&amp; also of the Navy Department, with the Officers
of which I have had frequent Official intercourse
it having been the Naval Station of the African 
Squadron.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For the information of the Department

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">F W Seward<br/>
            <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Acting[?]</span> Secretary of State</span>



in regard to myself in addition to what is found 
in the Files &amp; Records of the Department I 
beg leave to refer to Hon Chas Sumner, Hon 
John B Alley, Messrs Brookhouse  &amp; Hunt of 
Salem Mass &amp; John Pingres Esq of Auburn NY</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Very Respectfully<br/>
Your Obt Servt<br/>
John G. Willis</p>
