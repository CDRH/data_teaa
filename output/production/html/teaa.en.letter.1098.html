      <span class="tei_ab_type_letterhead tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor respectfully to
acknowledge the receipt of your No 4
despatch under date of January 10th 89.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In explanation of my (incorrectly
numbered 1) despatch of November 6th,
transmitting a reply to the Department
circular of September 20th last, concerning
the rates of duty levied on American goods;
I wish to state that, prior to the reception
of the circular above mentioned, I
had received from the Department
no document or communication over
the signature of Hon. A. A. Adee; and
as the despatches from me hitherto,
had been addressed only to the
Secretary and Assistant Secretary,
I was not quite sure that a reply
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to a document, from Hon. A. A. Adee,
should be numbered among those
addressed to the Assistant Secretary.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
E. E. Smith,<br/>
U.S. Consul Gen'l.</p>
