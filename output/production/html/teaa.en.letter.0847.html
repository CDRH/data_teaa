      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Consulate
at Sierra Leone<br/>
May 24th 1880</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon John Hay<br/>
Asst. Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge the
receipt of your dispatch (No 13) of
the 8th ulto, with inclosures relating
to the refusal of the Customs Authorities
at this port to grant clearance to the
American barque "Fury" via Matacong to
Boston &amp;c.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The U.S. Consul for this place
having left on his leave of absence,
I beg to state that I have made inquiry
into the above matter according to your
instructions, and I find, that the cause 
of the refusal on the part of the Customs
Authorities here to grant a clearance
to the "Fury" via Matacong thence
to Boston, without returning to this port
is based upon the claim which the
British Government puts forward
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to the island of Matacong and there
being no customs establishment at that
place. With respect to the nature and
extent of the British claims to the
island of Matacong, there is a Treaty,
copy of which I herewith inclose, copied
from Vol II Sierra Leone Ordinance &amp;c
Treaty of 1826. and has only of late
been disputed by the French Government
who, last year, erected a fort on the
island, and placed a garrison there,
against which the colonial authorities
here protested and the matter having 
been refered to the respective Governments
in Europe, the French Garrison
has been withdrawn, the British
Government being allowed jurisdiction
over the island pending arbitration on
the subject, and I find further that
the British authorities here had
duly issued a notice to all parties
concerned that all vessels touching at
Matacong, from Sierra Leone, would be
required to return to the latter port
for clearance.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg further to add that Messrs
Randall &amp; Fisher (British Subjects)
are deeply interested in the island as
lessees of the same, and have for
several years monopolised the trade
on the island. It also appears that
Messes Randall &amp; Fisher as British Subjects
have been specially notified
by the authorities that duties would be
levied on all merchandise or produce
imported or exported to or from the
island and in order to screen themselves
have induced the French authorities
to lay claim to the island;
and in the matter of the "Fury" it
appears that they are desirous of further
complicating matters by drawing the
U.S. Government into the dispute, to which
cause I think, may be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">traced[?]</span> Consul Lewis'
unwillingness to act in the matter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
M. W. Tobey<br/>
U.S. Vice Consul</p>
