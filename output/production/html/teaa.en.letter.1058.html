      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It becomes my painful duty
to acknowledge the receipt of your
communication of the 24th ultimo 
announcing the death of Honorable
Elihu B. Washburne, who was
at one time Secretary of State
of the United States, with instruction
to adopt the usual symbol of
public mourning for a period of
ten days as a testimony of respect
to the memory of the deceased;
which was immediately obeyed.
I conveyed to the Government of
Liberia through the State Department
the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">bad[?]</span> intelligence; and
I am advised, by the Secretary
of State, to convey to you, the
sympathy of the Government of

<span class="hr">Â </span>

of Liberia in the taking off of
such an eminent Statesman;
and with the Government of
the United States in the loss
it has sustained in the death
of so prominent and honored
citizen.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant,<br/>
Beverly Y. Payne<br/>
U.S. Acting Vice Consul</p>
