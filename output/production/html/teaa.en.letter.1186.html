Consul-General of the United States,<br/>
Monrovia, Liberia, Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir:-</p>
      <p class="tei_p">If not asking too much of you,
we will be pleased to have you send us
a list of the provision merchants in Monrovia,
as we are desirous of working up more
trade in this section.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We are now shipping goods to Messrs
Henry Cooper &amp; Son, and J. C. Dickinson,
and taking their coffee in exchange. We
believe a larger business can be done with
Africa, and therefore ask your help as
above. The writer wrote to your predecessor
a long time ago in regard to this
but has never received any reply.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">If we can be of any service to you here
in any way at any time kindly command me.
Trusting

<span class="hr"> </span>

Trusting you will grant our request
and that you are enjoying good health.
I have the honor to remain, sir, with
great respect,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Yours faithfully,<br/>
Albert W. Minick</p>
