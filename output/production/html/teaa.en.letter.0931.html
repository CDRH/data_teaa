      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit herewith my report for the quarter ended this day. It is desired to respectfully invite attention to the enclosed copy of my "Account Current" as transmitted to the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury; see inclosure No. 9. for the purpose of explaining that $20.25, with I therein credit Government is balance of one month's extra wages collected by me during December 1875 at the discharge from the barque Jasper of W.E. Cuff an american seaman; which extra wages was accounted for in my report of the 31st December 1875; but has remained in my possession until the present time. In the month January 1876,

1876, Frank Campbell, a seaman belonging to the same vessel was on shore drunk and riotous at Monrovia, at a late hour of the night of the day on which his vessel had taken out her clearance from the authorities here, and the ship's papers had been delivered to the Captain from this Consulate. After repeated complaints to me of the disturbance to the quiet of the place by Campbell's noisy drunkenness. I attempted to persuade him to board his vessel. But failing in the attempt thus to persuade the drunken man, I requested the Sherriff to arrest Campbell to and deliver him to the Captain on board the "Jasper" then under sail and endeavoring to depart for New York. The baneful nature of climatic influences here, and the long intervals between the visits of American vessels to this quarter, decided me that it was economic and humane to force Campbell to depart in his ship for New York, than to allow him to remain and risk his life in this climate; please see inclosures Nos 7. and 8. (The account, shown by the same copy of Account Current, for Desk book case, and office chair; was made by me under the following circumstances

circumstances. Upon my return to my post of duty now more than one year since, I found my books and Archives, especially the calf bound statutes of the United States, attacked and to some extent being destroyed by a white ant which abounds in this country, and is very destructive to books, papers, and wood of almost every kind. After an unavailing effort to rid the Consular Archives of this vermin; I determined that as my office was greatly in need of a bookcase in which to preserve the Archives, being furnished only with a table, an old chair, and a worm and ant eaten boxlike bookcase; that I might be justified in procuring the means made of foreign wood, and therefore distasteful to their vermin, to preserve my Archives from destruction. Hence, I purchased the articles of office furniture enumerated in Inclosure No. 6. And have drawn against my allowance for contingent expense for $93.50, draft dated April 2ond 1876: in part payment of the cost thereof; and have now most respectfully to request the

the Department to allow the whole amount as already paid by me.</p>
