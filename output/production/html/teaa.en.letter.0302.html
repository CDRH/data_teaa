Gaboon Dec 1st 1866</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would most respectfully call
your attention to the enclosed copy 
of a letter from the Rev. R. H. Nassau
American Missionary at Corisco.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The statements therein are unfortunately 
but too true. No less than two 
weeks ago, a sloop load of negroes,
was smuggled from the neighborhood of 
Kama (a village some fifty or
sixty miles distant) to Princes island,
and I find on inquiry that similar
transactions are of monthly, if not 
of weekly occurrence.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was also informed but yesterday,
by Henry A. Boardman, a trader,
long established at this place, and 
who has for years supplied the 
American vessels with bar-wood, ivory,
ebony, &amp; that two of his boats, had
been plundered of a valuable cargo,
while on a trading voyage up the 



<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Como[?]</span>, and that on a former occasion
when he had suffered a considerable 
loss from the depredations of the natives,
that his representations, had 
not been listened to, by the French 
authorities to whom he had applied
for redress.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This Sir, and those mentioned by 
the Rev. R. H. Nassau, on but a few
of the many instances which have 
occured when American citizens have 
either been <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> or maltreated 
without the power of obtaining
redress.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would also call your attention 
to my late despatch No 6 of the 17th
ulto, in reference to the difficulties 
of the American Bark Roebuck in 
which instance an American man 
of war would have been most 
desirable. Independent of these facts,
I believe, and it is the opinion of 
the missionaries and other American 
citizens residing on the coast 
that the presence of an American 



man of war would be very 
desirable that it would be beneficial to 
commerce, and add to the dignity 
of the nation.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">Trusting that this despatch will
meet with a favorable reception.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/> 
Very Respectfully<br/>
your obdt servt<br/>
Augustus Perrot<br/> 
U.S. Coml Agent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Corisco W. A.<br/>
Tuesday Nov 20th 1866.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir,</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">Permit me to address you as 
the representative and guardian of 
American interest on this part of the west 
coast of Africa; and represent to you the
great desirability of the presence of an 
American squadron here. There was a 
navy here before the war, and it ought 
to be restored since the Government is 
now so able and has such an abundance 
of vessels. If you take testimony 
from the Gaboon missionaries and 
traders, they will confirm what I hear
and believe at Kamba, that all along
this coast, small vessels still carry on 
a slave-trade with St Thomas and 
Princes islands, uncharted by the Spanish 
or French Governments. The recent 
robbery in the Muni, the robbery to which 
I was subjected among the Bapuku the 
shooting of young Maclauklin at Kamba
has been unpunished by either English 



or Spanish or French; and these are not 
the first acts of the kind that have 
you unpunished.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The dignity of our Government ought 
to leave some efficient sign of power. 
You will excuse the word efficient. You 
are a sign of our Governments power, 
but you will acknowledge yourself 
helpless without a flag or a national 
ship.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I present these few suggestions with 
the earnest wish that you will address
the Department on the subject. It 
would be a great joy to our eyes if we 
could monthly see the American flag 
passing along this coast.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Accept, dear Sir, sentiments of 
regards and believe me very 
truly yours,<br/>
Signed R. H. Nassau</p>
