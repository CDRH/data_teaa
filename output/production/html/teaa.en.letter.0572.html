      <p class="tei_p">Gramercy Park House<br/>
New York 6th of Sept. 1858</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the eve of my departure 
from Bathurst, River Gambia, for 
this country, for the benefit of my
health. I had the honor to receive
your communications of the fifteenth
of May last informing me,
that the President of the United States
had seen fit to appoint me Commercial 
Agent for the United States
at that port.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I now beg to enclose the 
official bond, duly signed, sealed, and 
certified to, by the United States 
Attorney, for the district.</p>

      <span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To the Honorable<br/> 
Lewis Cass<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</span>
    
      <span class="hr"> </span>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I was born in Pará,
Brazil, and am the son of Mr.
Benjamin Upton, an American
citizen, lately appointed Commercial 
Agent for Rosaire, Argentina
Confederation, and have resided
three years in Bathurst and 
received my appointment from 
the State of New York.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">It is in my opinion 
necessary for the interests of the 
United States, that an exequatur 
be procured from the British Government; 
particularly as there has 
hitherto been no American Consular
representative at that Colony.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I shall be ready to proceed 
to my post, by the first conveyance,
which will be by a vessel of my own
to sail in about three weeks.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It would be well to forward
to my address in this city, the Books,
General Instructions, Blanks,
Flags, Seals, &amp;c in readiness for
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

for the same conveyance, as another 
opportunity may not occur for some 
time.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The number of American 
vessels at Bathurst during the 
year is about thirty and I would 
respectfully submit to your consideration, 
whether so large an American
interest would not warrant, the 
establishment of a consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedt. &amp; humble Servt,<br/>
Danl R. B. Upton<br/>
U.S. Commercial Agent.</p>
