      <p class="tei_p">To Hon: John Davis<br/>
Asst. Secty of State<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to state, that I forwarded to 
Hon John M. Francis Minister Resident at
Lisbon; copy of clothing &amp;a issued to
destitute Am: seamen forwarded by Portuguese
Brig "Trorador" with receipt for their passage
&amp;a &amp;a duplicates of which I herewith 
enclose. I am in hopes that the state
Dept: will approve of my actions in
this case, to have sent them to Lisbon
for $10 a piece instead of Cape de
Verde Island for $23 a piece and that
only as a great favor from the Capts of 
the vessel: January, February, March
and April; there on hardly any
Portuguese vessels which come here, and
it would be a great difficulty to
send men away from this place
during these months if I had any 
on my hands.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have also forwarded to Hon John

<span class="hr"> </span>

M. Frances the petitions of the Am: Subject,
condemned for life deportation to this place
by the Portuguese Authorities; Their petitions
are enclosed by the best merchants of
Loanda, and I truly hope that their
liberty may be granted to them, being
now exhausted, with one foot in the
grave, having been here since 1869.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
