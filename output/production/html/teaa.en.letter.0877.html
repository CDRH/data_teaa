      <p class="tei_p">No. 50. U.S. Consulate at<br/>
Sierra Leone Feb. 23rd 1881</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon John Hay<br/>
Ass't Secty State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to inform you that on
Monday Feb. 21st the German
Corvette "Victoria" Captain
Victor Valois Commanding
arrived in this Port.
On the following day, I
paid an official visit on
board and was received with
all the honors due my
office.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Victoria is on special
detail and bound to Monrovia
Liberia - for the purpose of
conferring with the Liberian
authorities regarding the loss
of the German trading Steamer
"Carlos" Oct. 25th 1880. and



pillaging of the crew by the
Natives at or near "Saspa
Town" in Liberia.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">You are no doubt
already advised of this
by the Minister Mr Smyth.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Liberian Government
claim that the Steamer had
called or was about to call
at a place not a Port of Entry
for the purpose of shipping
Kroomen (as laborers) contrary to the laws
of the Republic.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am informed the crew, while
attempting to save their lives
by escaping in boats were
set upon and robbed of
every thing even to their
clothing, and left to roast
in the sun, and to punish
these people is the mission of
the Victoria.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Captain informs me that
he goes with the kindliest feelings
toward the Republic of Liberia</p>
