      <p class="tei_p">US Consulate, Goree-Dakar<br/>
Oct 27th 1886</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/> 
James D Porter<br/>
Ass't Secretary of State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Before American merchants
can fairly compete with Europeans
in the opening markets of the World,
they must learn that in some
countries superior packing is held
to be a factor of prime importance:
that in places where good coopers
are not to be had and there are 
but few practiced laborers, egg-<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
packages, no matter how choice
the Goods they contain, are sure
to be discriminated against. And
this American fault in packing 
is the more to be regretted because
it is precisely in those countries
where the best of packing is of necessity
required that the profits are always the greatest.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Among the articles which
Americans are interested to export
abroad, but which frequently are
not packed sufficiently well for 
the purpose. Flour may be instanced
as deserving perhaps the first notice.
Almost all newly developed countries
consume Flour largely, and as payment
in such countries is usually as payment
in such countries is usually made in
raw products which Americans
require for manufacturing purposes,
there is a double motive for dealing
with them direct, which dealing 
Americans should not forego by
refusing to take into account the
necessities of their situation. Now
in such countries, where teams are
always scarce, such articles as Flour
have sometimes to be transported
quite long distances by rolling, with
the result in case the Flour packages
are American of having a continuous
white trail of flour all along the
route, interspersed here and there
with heaps of it mixed with dirt

<span class="hr"> </span>
    
where heads have follow out, so 
that the condition in which a 
shipment of American Flour finally 
reaches the warehouse of the foreign
buyer is often such as to excite his
disgust if not his indignation.
The buyers of flour in intertropical
countries are seldom men who like 
making up for omissions of shippers
by coopering barrels themselves under
a broiling sun, and the upshot 
of the matter is, they give their 
preference to foreign flour because 
the packages are better, only dealing 
with Americans just enough to keep
their European Agents from imposing 
high prices on them.</p>    
    
      <p class="tei_p">There is also much prejudice
against American Flour-barrels
because they do not sufficiently
exclude the air, which causes the 
Flour to spoil quickly. French flour-
barrels besides being lined with 
paper have thirty hoops each and 
the heads well secure. Such   
   
<span class="hr"> </span>
   
packages preserve their contents
against even wet, and other things
being equal it would be indeed
surprising if foreign flour thus 
protected were not preferred in every 
competitive market. American 
Flour barrels for export should
have at least sixteen well-driven 
hoops each: the chimes
should be well protected and 
the heads well secured against
falling out; paper-lining is undoubtedly
an advantage, but with the barrels
made strong and light other refinements
may not be considered so necessary.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Cotton Goods from America
are usually in packages twice
too large and very illly fastened
together. Such packages are also in general quite insufficient to
protect their contents against
wet or even against a degree
of dampness which does not
amount to wet. Great unwieldy
cases are not proof against any

<span class="hr"> </span>

of the rough incidents which happen
on voyages to countries where the facilities
for handling and caring for such
packages have not been developed.
No match-box built American case
containing 2000 yards of "Prints" often
passing through a heavy surf, nor
would the security be much greater
if such a package had to be transported
from a boat on the heads of natives
to the top of a muddy river-bank.
Packages prepared in Europe are usually
constructed with a view measurably
to guard their contents against all
accidents of the nature described,
against slight showers even, and
I have seen Goods so nicely-enveloped
in oiled paper and other coverings
as to be safe if immersed a considerable
time in water. American Cottons
are hardly packed well enough to
protect them from the ordinary damp
and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">chasing[?]</span> of a vessels hold, and
for the numerous exigencies which

<span class="hr"> </span>

are sure to arise after such goods have 
been transported to foreign half-civilized
shores, no special provision is made.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is not necessary I think that I
should go more into this subject of
packing Goods for export, although
it appears one of great importance,
and worthy of immediate attention.
The time is certainly at hand
when the whole uncivilized world
will afford much the best markets
for many of the articles which
Americans are already anxious but
not well prepared to export and
if they do not occupy their ground
shortly they will at length have 
to do so under the over-shadowing
plants of a fierce European
competition. In England
already not only the shippers, but
the manufacturers and bankers
who back them have a care 
for their Goods until they reach
the consumers near the head
waters of the Senegal, the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Gambia[?]</span>

         <span class="hr"> </span>

the Niger, the Congo and
the Zambesi. Nothing appears
neglected by them which has 
the least tendency to ensure
success, while Americans, although
seemingly anxious to export, they 
are yet slow in adopting the
means which in the face of
brisk competition makes exportation
possible.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am esteemed Sir<br/>
Very truly yours<br/>
Peter Strickland<br/>
US Consul</p>
