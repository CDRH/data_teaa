      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
at St. Paul de Loanda<br/>
16th June 1888</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Honorable<br/>
G. L. Rives<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform the department
that as Mr Henry F. Downing failed
record his official correspondence
in the despatch book I am unable 
to number my dispatches and I
consequently leave them un-numbered
until the numbering is correctly
adjusted by the department.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Since the receipt of the Consular
regulations from the department, I
have learned that the Consulate is,
with the exception of the archives
(an inventory of which I forward
here with) wholly without the proper
legal belongings of the office</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As I informed the department in 
my communication of the 15th ultimo
all belongings of this Consulate were
seized by Mr Henry F. Downings
creditors, between the 15th and 30th of 
last March, while he was in transit 
to America, and before I assumed
the duties of the office.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">After presenting my credentials to
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the Governor General of the province
I requests his interference in 
relation to the delivery of the 
Consular effects into my hands, and
his advice to me was to the effect
that I should pay the indebtedness
and take charge, as he had no grounds 
for interference considering the fact
that Mr Downing had led his creditors
to believe that the United States were
responsible for his debts and doings
out here.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Having no other alternative I
went so far as to redeem the
archives, as the whole affair was
being very disgracefully talked about
and knowing also that the state
archives were not for the hands
and eyes for the outside world.
For the redemption of the archives
I paid one hundred and forty seven
dollars and sixty eight cents $147.68.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have here at present one
discharged seaman in the hospital
and one deserter also besides another
deserter whom I will send to the
Cape Verde Islands by this mail.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have also ordered for the
Consulate four (4) chairs, one ordinary
table, one large receptacle for archives
to protect them from insects which
are very destructive here until the
department furnishes something
better. I have also ordered a 
flag staff

<span class="hr"> </span>

flag staff to be erected, the cost
of which is 116 mil reis or 
$125.28. I have an old flag of
my own which I will use until
the department furnishes me with
another more appropriate.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The department will please also
furnish me with stationary and
office furniture, as it cannot be
purchased here, as cheaply as in
the United States, transportation
and all considered.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I desire to have a boat
also, if the department will be
good enough to supply one, as it
costs over $1.50 for the hire of 
a boat every time I visit a ship.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I drew on the treasury in last
month for $50 a draft in favor
of John Hass but not having any
regulations I find it was improperly
made out but from the nature of 
the circumstances I cannot but
hope that it was honored never-the-less.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor<br/>
to be Sir<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
Julius L Judson<br/>
Vice Consul</p>
