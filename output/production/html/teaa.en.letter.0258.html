of America at Sierra Leone<br/>
March 20th 1863</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to request that 
this office may be supplied with 
the usual consular blanks and 
official despatch paper as I am 
entirely out of them and they 
cannot be obtained in this colony.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg further to say that 
as considerable business is done in 
this office great inconvenience is 
experienced from the want of the 
regular consular books, real and 
press, the last administration 
having neglected to supply them 
at the time of my appointment.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I therefore beg to request that 
they may be supplied to this office.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Opportunities of forwarding 
packages to this colony occur 
frequently

Your most obedient servant<br/>
