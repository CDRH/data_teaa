      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you that we
have recently received a visit at this
part, from the United States Steamer
Essex, Commander W. S. Schley. she
remained a week, during which
time, we enjoyed the pleasant society
of Commander Schley, and his
gentlemanly officers, from whom we
received very kind and courteous
attentions. Permit me to make
honorable mention of the French-Commandant
Capt. J. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Boitard[?]</span>
who promptly furnished Commander
Schley with all needfull supplies,
to enable him to continue his 
voyage to the Congo and

 

St Paul de Loando. The visit
of this beautiful ship. with her
truly <del>and</del> Patriotic gentlemanly
Commander and officers, will
promote American interest in this
part of Africa; and I trust in
future, we may more frequently
receive visits from our national
vessels, than we have done since
the late war</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg to remain<br/>
Sir:<br/>
Most Respectfully,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Albert Bushnell<br/>
U.S. Com. Agent</p>
