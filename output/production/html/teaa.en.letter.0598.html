5th October 1878</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to own 
receipt of Your Excellency's despatch of 
the     September informing me that the 
President of the Republic has been pleased 
to appoint Mr John A Parm MD to be 
United States Consul for Sierra Leone 
and its dependencies in lieu of W. H. 
Randall Esqre and enclosing a printed 
circular addressed to John Broadhurst 
Esq:, who has recently been in charge of 
the Consulate, containing the same information.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The latter has been handed to 
Mr Broadhurst, who immediately delivered 
over to Dr Parm the Archives and other
appurtenances of the Consulate, and also 
apprised His Excellency the Governor in 
Chief of the contents of Your Excellency's 
communication. His Excellency
was

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">The Hon F. W. Seward<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State </span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

was pleased to reply that having received 
no official intimation of Dr 
Parm's appointment, he must refuse 
to acknowledge him in the capacity 
of United States Consul.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your Excellency is pleased to explain 
that Dr Parm's appointment has 
been made on the strong recommendations, 
no doubt bona-fide ones, of numerous 
and influential citizens of the United 
States. But Your Excellency must 
allow me to state that Dr Parm is a 
person whom I should deem it derogatory 
to my own dignity to work with or under, 
however strongly, and by however 
numerous and influential citizens recommended.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I therefore, however reluctantly, 
hereby resign my appointment as Vice 
Consul for the United States of America 
for Sierra Leone from the 1st inst, being 
the date of my receipt of Your Excellency's 
despatch informing me of Dr. Parm's appointment.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your Excellency's obedt servant<br/>
James Frame<br/>
late U.S. Consul</p>
