      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States 
of America at Sierra Leone<br/>
22nd March 1866.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">By the mail packet, in 
a despatch No 2. dated the 16th 
inst. I informed you of the 
change in the Government 
of this place, or rather of the 
British colonies on this part 
of the West Coast of Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Taking into consideration 
the above change, which Her 
Majesty's government has deemed 
necessary, on account of the growing 
prosperity, and importance of 
of the British settlements about 
this coast, I would most 
respectfully suggest it be 
a fitting opportunity to appoint
a higher consular officer than 
that of a consular agent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In making this suggestion 
I beg leave should it meet with the 
approval 

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">Hon W. H. Seward<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span> 

approval of the department 
to request that I might receive 
the appointment, and will state 
my reasons for feeling some confidence 
in so doing.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am a citizen of the United 
States, (Salem Mass) of native born 
parents, I have been a resident 
of this colony for seven years, 
arriving in April 1859 the commencement
of the epidemic of 
that year which carried off about 
80 of the white inhabitants among 
others John E. Tylor Esq the Acting 
Consul of this place, for the United 
States, and as the colony lost 40 
whites during the rains of last year 
I may safely say I have passed 
through two epidemic seasons 
since my arrival, so with so 
long a residence and passing 
through two epidemics safely I feel 
I have reason to consider myself 
thoroughly acclimated.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Five years and six months of 
the

<span class="hr"> </span> 

the seven years I have held 
the position of Consular Agent 
of the United States, and as 
such I have had to do all the 
work of a consul, without the 
full powers, and priviledges of 
such an officer.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The three years before the war 
our commercial transactions 
with this place were very large 
and it was common to see from 
Eight to ten American vessels 
in port at the same time 
but in the latter part of 1860 
our difficulties commencing
interfered very much with business 
and both imports and exports 
rapidly decreased, although it 
improved a little during the 
years 1861 and 1862 it was however, 
carried on almost entirely 
under the British flag.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Now that the war is over 
I confidently expect to see 
the business of this colony 
reach 

<span class="hr"> </span>

reach its healthiest average 
of about $300,000 or $350,000, and 
this with the American trade 
with Gambia would <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">swell[?]</span> 
the transaction of business between 
the United States, and the Coast 
under the the new Governor General 
to about $550,000 to $600,000 it 
is really an interest the U.S. 
Government should consider 
and give it all the protection 
in its power.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The unfortunate civil war 
having closed, American vessels 
are already beginning to arrive 
and others are cleaning for the 
place from the United States, 
this will increase the work of 
the office which during the 
war has certainly been rather 
slack, an other addition also 
to the the work now, will be 
the looking after the interests of 
U.S. vessels of war in the port; their
arrival I am informed by 
Commander

<span class="hr"> </span>

Commander Harrell of the 
"Kearsarge", which came into the 
port to coal, and sailed on the 
14th for down the coast, will be 
frequently hereafter.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Aside from our commerce requiring 
a higher Consular officer, 
by the provisions of the slave treaty 
with Great Britain necessitates 
the station of a consul if not 
a higher officer here, as this is one
of the places <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">named[?]</span> as the position
of the mixed commission court, 
and in event of absence if 
judge and arbitrater being 
absent the present position 
will not allow of acting for 
them. Such a contingency has 
arisen as the judge is I believe 
in Washington and the Arbitrater 
been obliged to leave on 
amount of severe illness.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There are in the place a 
French Consul, Spanish consul, 
and our Consul, Portuguese Consul, 
Consul

<span class="hr"> </span>

Consul for the Netherlands, and 
Liberian Consul.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The French Government 
knowing of the change here 
have given their Consul authority 
to appoint Consular agents
in all places under the 
new Governor Generalship, and also are 
about to send him out a small
steamer to carry him to the different 
places under the new 
government, their commerce
cannot arrive to that importance,
excepting in exports, 
which ours holds it its prosperous
periods.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Earnestly desiring the reasons 
herein set forth will convince 
the department, that this 
is a Consulate which should 
be represented by a higher 
consular officer of the United States</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/> 
Sir<br/>
Your obed't Servant<br/>
Henry Rider<br/>
U.S. Consular Agent</p>
