25th November 1858</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to 
report my arrival in this Colony 
on the 4th instant.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Having applied to His
Excellency Governor O'Connor for 
leave to act as Commercial Agent,
of the United States, without an
Exequatur. I have received his 
despatch of yesterday's date, which 
I have the honor to enclose, refusing
to recognize me as such, without the 
sanction of the British Government.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I respectfully suggest
that it would perhaps be well to 
forward said despatch to London 
when application is made for an
Exequatur, which I trust will be done.
    
<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To the Honorable Lewis Cass<br/>
Secretary of State &amp;c &amp;c</span>
    
         <span class="hr"> </span>

done with as little delay as possible
as my present position in regard to
American vessels is <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">so[?]</span> doubtful.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Now that an Exequatur
is necessary, rendering null thereby
one of the object of the appointment 
of Commercial Agents, why not 
make this a Consulate under
Schedule C: that I may rank with 
the Consular Representative of 
France in this place.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">This port is certainly more
important to American interests
than Monrovia, Gaboon or St. Paul
de Loanda; why would not the same
salary be just? the amount of fees
on about thirty vessels per annum
is quite inadequate to the services 
required.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Case containing Record
Books, Flags, &amp;c has not yet been
received from Monoria, neither has
    
<span class="hr"> </span>
    
the seal: Wheatons Elements of
International Law, the Consular
Regulations and some blank forms
were received in New York.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your most obedient &amp; humble servt<br/>
Danl RB Upton<br/>
U.S. Commercial Agent</p>
