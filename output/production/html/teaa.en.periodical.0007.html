         <h3>Only Four in the World.</h3>

      </div>

      <div class="article">

         <p class="tei_p">Liberia and Abyssinia are the only independent Negro governments in
Africa, while Hayti and Santo Domingo are the only two in the New
World. Emigrationists must chose between these four and no more for
the exodus of the American Negro. Language and religion would count
out Hayti, Santo Domingo and Abyssinia, to say nothing of general customs 
in the last. Liberia alone is left; but it is independent only in a
nominal sense and by the favor of the great white nations. It is financially
a dependency of Germany, and sentimentally a ward of the United States.
There seems to be nothing to do, therefore, but to let down our buckets
where we are, in the expressive figure of Dr. Washington.</p>
