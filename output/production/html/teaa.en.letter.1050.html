Monrovia Liberia<br/>
July 1st 1887</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to call your attention to my No (1)
Consular Series, of date May
31st You will find therein, an account
of my transit from Wyandotte Kas., to
Monrovia, consuming 49 days, I have
drawn drafts on Secretary of State, as
stated for 43 days of said time. I desire
to respectfully call your attention to
section 47 of the Consular reg. for '81,
which I think justifies me in drawing
for the other six (6) days at the rate

<span class="hr"> </span>

of $5000 per annum. I was forced to
remain in Liverpool at the time I
arrived there until the departure of (the
Elder Dempster &amp; Co.'s Steamship) the
Roquelle. You will find that the
Roquelle does not cull at Monrovia,
but did so on their outward trip, at
the time mentioned out of respect to the 
U.S. Government. If I had waited for steamer
calling at Monrovia, I would not have
arrived until June 9th instead of May 30th 1887.
I hope that you may see that this added
time, to the Hon. Secretary of State's maximum
amount schedule, was caused by circumstances
wholly beyond my control and therefore
approve my "draft" for the am't of $82.42 making
the total am't for "transit" $673.08.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am your obedient servant &amp;c.,<br/>
Chas. H. J. Taylor<br/>
U.S. Consul Gen'l</p>
