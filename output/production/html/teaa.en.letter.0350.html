      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States<br/>
Zanzibar December 14 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to advise 
the Department of the
arrival at Zanzibar on
the 6th inst of Mr. Stanley
and the Emin Relief Expedition.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Emin Pasha unfortunately
met with quite a serious
accident immediately after
the banquet given by the
Germans at Bagamayo and
it has not been deemed
advisable to have him
removed to Zanzibar.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Stanley is the  
guest of the British Consul
General and the Emin Relief
Committee and has been
shown every attention

<span class="hr"> </span>

a reception rendered him
last evening at the British
Consulate General was largely
attended and was a 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> success.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is expected that Mr.
Stanley with his <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> will
take his departure from
Zanzibar about the 25th inst.
by one of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Steamers[?]</span>
that is coming here to
convey Emin's people to 
Egypt. It is hoped that
Emin Pasha will be able
to go at the same time
but it is considered doubtful 
if he can be moved
with safety.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Seth A. Pratt<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
