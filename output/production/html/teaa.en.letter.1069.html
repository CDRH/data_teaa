      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Not many weeks ago I wrote
you in regard to the disallowance
the United States Government
made of $411.88 which was due
me, on my salary for service
rendered as U.S. Vice Consul
Genl at Monrovia. Please see
that justice be given me, for the
disallowance is not just.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hoping my case will receive
your attention with full justice.
I am, Sir,

<span class="hr">Â </span>

Respectfully Yours<br/>
Samuel S. Sevier</p>
