      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform the
Department that the continued indisposition
under which I labored during the time
occupied in making transit to my post, after
my arrival at Loanda culminated in an aggravated
case of inflammation of the bladder
and in kidney troubles.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Because of being dependent upon
my salary for the support of my family and
myself, I have been compelled to deprive myself
of that clerical assistance which my
condition demanded, and in despite of much 
suffering from pain and weakness from loss of
blood I have persisted in the endeavor to perform
the duties of my office.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">This condition has unfortunately

affected my correspondence, and I am in 
doubt as to the numbering of my despatches
and would respectfully ask the Department
to furnish me with memorandum of title
and number of despatches received from 
this Consulate since the 1st Ultimo; so that
I may be able to correct errors to date.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am glad that I am able to
report that my condition is improving, and
have reason to believe that a month or two
will see me again enjoying health.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Henry F. Downing,<br/>
U.S. Consul.</p>
