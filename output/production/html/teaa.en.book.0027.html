            <h3>Analysis</h3>

            <p class="tei_p">
               <em class="hi">Chants for the Boer</em> is a book of verse by Western American poet Joaquin Miller. Published in 1900, in the midst of the Second Boer War in Southern Africa, Miller's poems voice a popular position in the United States: full-throated support of the Boers—"so like ourselves a century back"—against the British. He concludes "To the Boers," for example, with the rousing cry, "Give her such welcome with such will/As Boston gave in battle's whir/That red, dread day at Bunker Hill." In his preface, Miller includes a quotation from a letter by Herbert Spencer, in order to demonstrate that many British subjects also opposed the actions of their government. Among the poems found in Miller's book are "Usland to the Boers ["Usland" being Miller's acronymic neologism for the U.S.]," "Fight a Boy of Your Size," and "To Oom Paul Kruger, on his Seventy-Fifth Birthday." Not all of the poems included in the book, however, address the Second Boer War; "Mother Egypt" criticizes England's occupation of Egypt in a manner similar to Miller's "Africa." Of Egypt, he writes, "If she be dead, respect the dead ... She suckled at her tawny dugs/Your Moses while you reeked in wars/And prowled your woods, nude, painted thugs." On the subject of modern black Africans, including those affected by the Second Boer War, Miller is silent.</p>

            <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">*See report of Julian Hawthorne, sent by a New York magazine to photograph and give details of the starving in India, about the time of the Jubilee. He does not give these figures, but his facts and photographs warrant a fearful estimate. As for the subjugation of India and the wanton destruction, not only of life, but the very means of life, this is history. And now, again, is despoiled India starving,—starving, dying of hunger as before; even more fearfully, even while England is trying to despoil the Boers. And when her speculators and politicians have beaten them and despoiled them of their gold and diamonds and herds, what then? Why, leave them to starve as in India, or struggle on in the wilderness as best they can.</span>

            <span class="tei_l">Drank as you hardly may come to when</span>

         <h3>Usland* To The Boers.</h3>
 
         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">And where lies Usland, Land of Us?</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Where Freedom lives, there Usland lies!</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">Fling down that map and measure thus</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Or argent seas or sapphire skies:</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">To north the North Pole, south as far</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">As ever eagle cleaved his way;</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">To east the blazing morning star,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">And west? West to the Judgment Day!</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">No borrowed lion, rampt in gold;</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">No bleeding Erin, plaintive strains;</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">No starving millions, mute and cold;</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">No plundered India, prone in chains;</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">No peaceful farmer, forced to fly</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Or draw his plowshare from the sod,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">And, fighting, one to fifty, die</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">For freedom, fireside and God.</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Fear not, brave, freeborn, voiceless Boers.</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Great Usland's heart is yours to-day.</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">Aye, England's heart of hearts is yours,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Whatever scheming men may say.</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">Her scheming men have mines to sell,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">And we? Why, meat and corn and wheat.</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">But, Boers, all brave hearts wish you well;</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">For England's triumph means defeat.</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">* It is a waste of ink and energy to write "United States of America" always. All our property is marked Us. Then why not Usland? And why should we always say American? The Canadian, the Mexican, the Brazilian and so on are as entirely entitled to the name American as we. Why not say Usman, as Frenchman, German, and so on?</span>

         <h3>Fight A Boy Of Your Size.</h3>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Back, far back in that backwood's school</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Of Lincoln, Grant and the great we prize</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">We boys would fight, but we had one rule—</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">You must fight a boy of your size.</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Or white boy or brown, aye, Boer no doubt,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Whatever the quarrel, whatever the prize</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">You must stand up fair and so fight it out</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">With a boy somewhat your size.</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">But a big boy spoiled so for fights, he did,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">He lied most diplomatic-like-lies</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">And he fought such fights—ye gods forbid—</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">But never a boy of his size.</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">He skinned and he tanned, kept hide, kept hair,</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Now I am speaking figure-wise—</span> 
            <span class="tei_l">But he didn't care who and he didn't care where</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">Just so he was under size.</span> 
         </span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Then the big boy cried, "A big chief am I,</span>

            <span class="tei_l">Then the good Schoolmaster he reached a hand</span>

            <span class="tei_l">That bully, and raise in his good right hand</span> 
            <span class="tei_l_rend_indent tei_l">A board of considerable size.</span>
