<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Born in Portland, Maine, in 1859, Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins attended Boston's Girls High School. In the 1870s, she performed with family members as part of the Hopkins Colored Troubadours, gained a reputation as "Boston's Favorite Colored Soprano," and became the first African American woman playwright. Beginning in the early 1890s, she worked as a stenographer. In 1900, the Colored Cooperative Publishing Company issued her novel <em>Contending Forces</em> and, in May of that year, began publishing the <em>Colored American Magazine</em>, in which a remarkably large number of writings by Hopkins, including the novels <em>Haaar's Daughter</em>, <em>Winona</em>, and <em><a href="teaa.en.periodical.0095">Of One Blood</a></em>, appeared. Listed as chief editor on the masthead in March 1904, she was demoted and later fired when an ally of Booker T. Washington purchased <em>Colored American Magazine</em> and moved it from Boston to New York City. In 1916, she founded and edited the short-lived <em>New Era Magazine</em>. She died as a result of a fire in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1930.</p>
