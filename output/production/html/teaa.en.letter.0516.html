      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of Department's despatch dated
the 2d inst.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would respectfully advise
that deprived of opportunity, because of
distance to secure information, I have no
connections to make as to statement of 
facts as therein mentioned, but I
regret that it was not in the power
of the Department to assume the position 
it now takes before I had now further
committed myself to the Government
in a pecuniary way. Since my arrival
in the United States, I have been allowed 
and paid $170.00. acct. salary, also
under instructions from the Treasury 
Department



Department I on the 2d inst. disposed
of a draft on the Secretary of the Treasury 
at 15 d/s for $65. 17/100 residue of salary.
This latter draft I am able to and will
withdraw. Referring to other drafts
drawn by me I understand that
with the exception of two, they have 
all been paid. These two that were
returned unpaid I have recovered
and have satisfied the parties who
held them. Viz: Messrs Dan <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Solwaiz[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Kopf[?]</span> &amp; Co. of New York and Joseph Taylor
of Brooklyn in the amount as per
their face value. This relieves the
Department from the necessity of 
considering them.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In recommending the 
removal of Robt. L. Newton Esq. as
U.S. Consul at St. Paul de Loanda
I had in view only the performance
of my duty as an U.S. Consul i.e. as
far as it touched the cultivation of
our foreign trade. A vast market teeming
with fast developing riches offering
prizes to commercial enterprise, I
found



found, on my arrival at Loanda,
monopolized by European nations. I 
saw with envious jealousy the vessels
of England, Germany, Holland and 
other European countries emptying that
fertile land of its products and their
citizens growing wealthy through
well directed efforts of their Consuls,
not the least active of whom was
H. B. M's Consul Robt. L. Newton Esq.
knowing that at one time America
had been building up a trade there
growing in importance every day but
had now died. I believed it would 
be wise to find the reason for its
decline. On examination I found
that the withdrawing of American
bottoms from the African trade during
our domestic troubles while interrupting
did not destroy our commercial prestige
in that direction for our exports to 
Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cape 
Town are still making gratifying
advance yet Angola, a province
written the valuable district of 
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the Congo with its principal city 
Loanda had been gradually
eliminated from a condition of usefulness 
to our industries until now
commercial intercourse is nil and
the situation is such as allows the
mercantile house of Newton, Carnegie
&amp; Co. to inform the Department through
me that there is no paying <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">inducements[?]</span>
for the introduction of American goods
there, and this in the face of the fact
that England finds there a growing
and paying market for, not only
her wares, but can dispose of in large
quantities, of petroleum originally
bought from us. Correspondence with
other and disinterested merchants advised
me that only a want of knowledge
of American products prevented their use
I therefore had reason to think that
the competition between nations, which
is finding an opportunity to express
itself so positively in Africa, hindered
a Commercial Agent of the most, aggressive, 
commercially, nation of the
world.

<span class="hr"> </span>

world. England from during justice to
the needs of our revising commerce. For
this, with other reasons I recommended the
removal of Mr. R. L. Newton.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When I nominated Mr Baines
I did not know that it was his intention
to be for any time absent from Loanda
Pecuniary embarrassments everyday growing
more serious and prohibiting further residence
made my departure from Loanda <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
and, acting upon leave as granted by 
the Department, I took such steps in
the absence of Mr. Baines as would. I 
thought: be approved by the Department
and without prejudice to Mr. Baine's
appointment requested the Governor of
the Province to recognize Mr Judson as
Act'g U.S. V. Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Judson's capacity was
beyond dispute and as an ordained
minister of the gospel enjoying the confidence 
of Bishop Taylor and as an
American citizen he was envisioned by
such qualities as naturally earned for
him my confidence, causing me without
hesitation



hesitation, to entrust him with the temporary 
change of the Consulate. That he has 
used the powers entrusted with him in a 
wrong manner is to be deplored but, at
the same time, I think that I should 
be relieved from my blame except
such as may attach to an allowable 
mistake.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In justice to myself I must
call attention to the fact that Mr Judson
had no right or, recognizable right, 
to admit that the U.S. Government was
responsible for my private debts &amp; by the
payment of my debts recover Govmt
property. There was a proper remedy
which if applied would have cost
the Government or the Consulate nothing.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have no thought or desire
to think responsibility for this man's
actions but I regret that earlier knowledge 
in the premises was not mine, for 
then I would not have taken up 
my part of my pay and thereby
would have been much less in debt
to the government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">What



What course the Department
may elect to pursue in this matter
I do not know yet having confidence
in its justice I am at its dispersal and
will act in accordance with its instructions.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Henry F. Downing<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
