United States of America<br/>
Sierra Leone August 10th 1868.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Office being deficient in 
many necessary requirements to carry 
it on creditably, which are either 
not procurable or by far too expensive 
at this place, I request the 
Department of State will be pleased 
to send me the following, viz:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">1) A set of proper Books, those 
in use being very old and out of 
all Consular form.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">2) A moderate supply of 
Stationary</p>

      <p class="tei_p">3) A couple of Flags, the only 
one

         <span class="hr"> </span>

one in use being too-large and too-good,
suitable only got great festivals.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">4) Consular Arms which are entirely 
wanting.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">If not consistent with the Service 
I should also be glad to receive a 
moderate supply of American Flower 
and Garden seeds from the Agricultural 
Department for introduction in 
this Country.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Vessels are very frequently leaving 
Boston for this port and Captains 
would be glad to carry any parcel 
from the Department free of freight.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/> 
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/> 
Rosenbush.<br/>
U.S. Vice-Comm: Agent.</p>
