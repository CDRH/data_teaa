      <p class="tei_p">Judson A. Lewis To Dept State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Captain Roberts Bark Hazard
refuses to take two destitute Seamen
and leaves his Papers in Consulate</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">No 41 U.S. Consulate at<br/>
Sierra Leone Dec. 24th 1880.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon John Hay<br/>
Ass't Secty State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform
you that Captain D. A.
Roberts of the American
Bark Hazard cleared
from this Port yesterday
for Boston Mass. U.S.A.
consigned to Mansfield and
Roberts of Boston laden
with Dry Hides.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Captain Roberts refused
to take Two destitute
American Seamen David
Freethey and Walter Duval on
board for transportation
to the United States under the
law and in accordance with
Consular Regulations Par. 

<span class="hr"> </span>

123. and 124. I retained his
Papers. and he proceeded
to sea leaving in this Consulate
his Register Shipping
Articles and Crew List, together
with Bill of Health, Hide
Certificate and Certificate given
to Masters when required to
take to the United States destitute
American Seamen - all 
of which I had prepared for
him.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">One of these men Walter Duval
lately arrived from Grand
Bassa although fit to go to sea
would not be fit for any labor
as you will see by the
enclosed Certificate of the
Colonial Surgeon.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Surgeon and myself
thought it would be far
better for him to go to sea
than to remain here for Six
weeks waiting for the arrival
and departure of another

<span class="hr"> </span>

American vessel - and 
reasoning if one of the
ships Sailors was in the
same condition as the said
Walter Duval the Captain
would most certainly have
taken him: consequently I 
considered it quite proper
to send him at this time,
and read the Captain the Surgeon
Certificate and furnished him
with a copy of same.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Captain Roberts is a man
who flies off at a tangent
on the slightest provocation
either imaginary or real
and cannot be reasoned
with: and I would most
respectfully recommend
and urge that the most
stringent measures which
the law provides be taken
in this case, as there was
no good reason why the
men should not have gone.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">The Captain being in his usual
noisy and explosive state
abused and tried to brow beat
the Sailors and the Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I put the men together
with their effects on board
the vessel and he sent
them ashore again in 
the ships boat as you
will see by the deposition
of the two sailors enclosed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the absence of
any instruction or information
in the Regulation
touching such <del>this</del> a case I
send all the Papers enclosed
to the Department viz
Register, Shipping Articles,
Crew List, Hide Certificate, 
and Bill of Health.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I also enclose Consular
Certificate marked A.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
Very Respectfully<br/>
Your Obt Servt Judson A Lewis<br/>
U.S. Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I hereby certify that I have this day
examined the seaman Walter Duval.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He is in a delicate state of health
and unfit for any work at present.
If it can be arranged that he
could travel to America as passenger
merely until he regains his strength
I would recommend that he be sent
by the first vessel leaving this port
for America, but he is not fit
for any work on board and will
require two or three weeks and as
good food as can be provided
before he will be fit.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At present he has no signs
of any organic disease but is
only suffering from debility the
result of Coast Fever</p>

destitute American Seamen
do take oath to the following
statement</p>

      <p class="tei_p">One Thursday Dec. 23rd 1880.
we were sent aboard the
American Bark Hazard
Roberts Master lying in 
the Harbor at Sierra Leone
together with all our affects
by the U.S. Consul Judson
A. Lewis.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Captain and the first Mate
were on shore when we
came on board - in about
an hour - the Captain and
Mate came on board -
The Captain swore he would
not have us aboard of
the vessel &amp; that we must 
go ashore - and addressing
Walter Duval said even if I 
had you aboard when
I got out to sea where
you have no Consul

<span class="hr"> </span>

to protect you - I'll fix 
you.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He made us go in the
ships boat &amp; put all our 
effects into said boat &amp; sent
us on shore - saying he'd
be d-d- if he have us
aboard &amp; when we got
ashore we could go and
report to the Consul &amp; he
didn't care a G-d-
d-d for the Consul
any more than he did
for us-</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The last thing he said as
we were leaving addressing
Daniel Freethey was - if you
can steal aboard I'll take
you-</p>
