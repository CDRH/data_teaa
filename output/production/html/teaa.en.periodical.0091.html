      <p class="tei_p">The slave trade between Africa and Arabia is far from being suppressed. According to <em class="hi">L'Afrique</em> there is, on the borders of the Red Sea, a regular price current for slaves. Girls from 10 to 15 years of age bring from $80 to $100; boys from 7 to 11, $60 to $80; young women from 16 to 22, $50 to $70; young men from 15 to 26, $30 to $50. The slave caravans rarely have men who are above 25 years of age. It has been a question as to what became of these slaves after they entered Arabia. It is now affirmed that Moslem pilgrims to Mecca, coming from various parts of the world, take back with them to their homes slaves of both sexes. This is the case at Constantinople, for though the traffic is prohibited by law, evasions are winked at. The trade is wholly in the hands of Moslems, and the open market which makes the trade profitable is under the shadow of the shrine of their prophet.</p>
