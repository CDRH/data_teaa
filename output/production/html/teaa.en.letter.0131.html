      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St Paul de Loanda<br/>
24th May 1881</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
again draw your attention to my
Despatch No 56 dated as far back as
23rd July 1880, and I hear from
Mr Colville that the Bills drawn by
him have not been accepted as yet.
consequently I am obliged to pay to
this gentleman the amount of Salary
he ought to have received during my
absence in England viz:</p>

      <table class=" tei_table table table-bordered table-condensed">
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">June 30th 1879</td>
            <td class=" tei_td">$172.08</td>
         </tr>
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">Sept 30th " </td>
            <td class=" tei_td">$250.00</td>
         </tr>
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">Dec  31st " </td>
            <td class=" tei_td">$231.61</td>
         </tr>
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">Jany 12th 1880</td>
            <td class=" tei_td">$32.96</td>
         </tr>
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">Total</td>
            <td class=" tei_td">$686.65</td>
         </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="tei_p">I therefore beg to draw the 
attention of the Department to this;
and to place the matter before them 
if they think it just that I should
pay this amount without receiving
any recompense from the Government</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr



Mr Colville was appointed
with the sanction of the Department,
and with the understanding that he
would receive the salary during my 
absence, as has been hitherto the
custom; otherwise I do not think he 
would have accepted the Appointment,
and there was no other person that
I could have delivered the Consulate
to at the time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your most obedient servant,<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
Vice-Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the<br/> 
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
