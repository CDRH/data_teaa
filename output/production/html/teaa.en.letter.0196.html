      <p class="tei_p">Department of State<br/>
Monrovia, Liberia<br/>
May 15th 1879</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My Lord</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Referring to my dispatch of Oct. 16th
1878, in which I informed your Lordship
that the Liberian government had
appointed two Commissioners to
meet the Mixed Commission on the
North Western Boundary Question:
I have the honor to express the very deep
regret of His Excellency the President
that the said commission failed
to accomplish the results so anxiously
desired.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I need not stop here to give
you a detailed account of the
tedious

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">The Most Honourable<br/>
The Marquess of Salisbury<br/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<br/>
Foreign Office<br/>
London</span>

         <span class="hr"> </span>

tedious and expensive delay experienced by
our Commissioners in Sierra Leone
while waiting first for the arrival
of H. M. Commissioners, and 
then for their instructions from
the Foreign Office; for no doubt 
you have been fully apprised of
this by the despatches that have
reached you, both from His Excellency
Governor Rowe, as also from your
Commissioners.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As much as this Government
regret the inconvenience and
expense to which both the Republic
and many of her citizens were
subjected in consequence of H. M. 
Commissioners not being prepared 
to meet until three weeks after
the time fixed for the commencement
of the

<span class="hr"> </span>

of the session yet believing that I arose from
unavoidable causes they waive all
complaint on that score. But where
after the meeting of the Commission
points arose upon which the Commission
disagreed, this Government fail to see
upon what Grounds H. M. Commission
was refused to submit those points to
the Arbitration of the United States
Government. This occurred first 
in Sierra Leone where a point of 
disagreement arose, which in the opinion
of this Government should have been
submitted to the U.S. Arbitrator Commodore
Sufeldt; according to the terms
of the Draft Proposals which has
been suggested by H. M. Government
and accepted by Liberia as the basis
of the investigation. To such a
course

<span class="hr"> </span>

course H. M. Commissioners persistently objected.
The Commissioners on the part of this
Government, firm in the conviction
of the justice of  Our Claims, and
anxious for a settlement of the Question;
yielded.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">An adjournment was agreed upon
by the Mixed Commission, in pursuance
of which they met at Solymah
on the 1st of April last. The result
of eighteen days deliberation-during
which the Commission examined the 
Title deeds of this Government and
took oral testimony of witnesses brought
forward on the part of this Government 
as well as on behalf of the native
Chiefs repudiating our Claims to
Sovereignty, was another disappointments.
The Liberia Commissioners
holding

<span class="hr"> </span>

holding that we had proved our title to
the territories known as "Sugaree,"
"Manna, Rock &amp; River" and "Solymah"
and H. M. Commissioners averring
that no such countries existed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Liberian Commissioners
submitted that, according to the
terms of the Draft Proposals, mentioned
above, and the Instructions of
both the English and Liberian
Commissioners, the matter
should be referred to the American
Arbitration for his decision.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This your Commissioners
refused to do, averring their inability 
to do more than take
the opinion of the American
Arbitration, and claiming that
such opinion could have no effect 
in settling the Question
unless

<span class="hr"> </span>

unless approved by H. M. Government.
In the face of their instructions
and the Draft Proposals above
cited our Commissioners could
not agree to this and the 
Commission adjourned.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Unless, My Lord, the Liberian
Government have utterly failed 
to understand the terms of the
Draft Proposals, accepted by both
governments as the basis for the 
settlement of this question, I beg
most respectfully to insist that
there is a manifest error on the part
of H. M. Commissioners.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I say error because I cannot
conceive that, in the face of the
very positive instructions 
emanating from H. M. Government 
enjoining

<span class="hr"> </span>

enjoining upon the Commissioners "strict 
impartiality" they could allow themselves 
to be influenced by any other
than proper motives.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am quite aware that there
is a very strong effort put forth on
the part of British Traders in
that Neighborhood to render successful 
the efforts of the Aborigines
to repudiate over authority, and
while we have abundant reason
to believe that the dismemberment,
aye even the extinction of Liberia
would not in the opinion of these
Traders be too great a price at 
which to secure for themselves
the produce of that country,
Yet I am sure that there is too
high a sense of justice and honor
not

<span class="hr"> </span>

not to say magnanimity in H. M.
government, as well as those
who represent her in official
relations, to sympathise with
any such selfish feelings. And 
I cherish the opinion that it 
is only necessary to call the attention 
of H. M. government
to this subject, in order to have
the points in dispute referred
to the Arbitration.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your Lordship will pardon
me for further trespassing on
your kindness, while I call your
attention to one or two points.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In this Question of the
North Western Boundary of the
Republic, which has for so many
years being pending and which
has

<span class="hr"> </span>

has caused incalculable loss to this
Government; H. M. Government
sets up no claim to the territory
and has therefore nothing to lose
by the delay of its settlement; but
Liberia on the other hand is 
continually losing in consequence
of this dispute. If you will
take into consideration the
large amount of money that
would have accrued to thus 
Government had we been permitted to
enforce our Revenue Laws, as well
as the outlays that we have made
from time to time first in efforts
to suppress the Slave Trade, and
then to enforce order and keep peace
among the several tribes of that
section, you can readily understand

<span class="hr"> </span>

understand our wish for a speedy settlement of
the matter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">And furthermore there is 
a point of far graver character to
which it is my duty to call your 
attention. I refer to the general
spirit of insubordination and rebellion
against the Authority of the 
Government which is springing
up among the natives in almost
every part of this Republic, growing
out of this Question.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Extensive combinations are
being formed among the tribes
to throw off then allegiance to
this Government under the 
impression that H. M. Government
will afford the same encouragement 
and support that it 
is

<span class="hr"> </span>

is alleged to be giving to the tribes in
the disputed Territories. This Government
cannot for a moment entertain
the idea that their expectations will
be realized, since it has long since
been a matter of record that Great
Britain acknowledges the claims of
Liberia to all territory between the
"Sugaree" on the North West and the 
"San Pedro" on the South East. Nor can
I suppose for a moment that Great 
Britain would allow on the part of
her officials or citizens any actions
that would tend to undermine
our National Fabric. But I simply
make this reference to show the
effect that the attitude of H. M.
Government in connection with
the North Western Boundary Question
is

<span class="hr"> </span>

is producing on the tribes within our
domain.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Trusting that your Lordship
will take an early opportunity of
calling the attention of H. M. Government 
to the subject of this despatch,
and assuring you of very high consideration,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Your Lordship's Obt. Svt.<br/>
sd G. W. Gibson<br/>
Secretary of State</p>
