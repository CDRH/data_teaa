      <p class="tei_p">Protectorate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">No. 30.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Consulate General of the U.S.,<br/>
Monrovia, La, August 21, 1879.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you respectfully that by reference to my No. 30, dated May 30, 1879, diplomatic series, you will observe that this is a second recurrence to the same matter by the French.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Secretary of State advised me to day that the matter of an application of France through the Liberian Consul–, at Bordeaux, has been made, asking that that

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">Hon. H. Hunter,<br/>
Ass't Secretary,<br/>

         <span class="hr"> </span>

that gentleman use his influence with Liberia to obtain the consent of the Government to become a protectorate</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The reasons set forth are of the same tenor as I advised the Department of some time ago, except that there is a more sentimental word display of interest in the Liberian Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am glad to be able to record the disapproval of the proffered benefits foreshadowed at the expense of the subordination of Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Now if the United States have no other interest in Liberia than than they have in the existence in any similar form of Government, that

<span class="hr"> </span>

that alone would be sufficient in view of a recognition of Liberia by treaty relations–to desire its independent continuity as a Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It may not be too much to assume that the U.S. will feel some pride in beholding the former bondmen of the South making a laudable effort in heathen Africa to carry out practically those great principles of government that in many respects make our Government the equal, and in many instances the superior of the first empires of the old world.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I most cordially assent to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to and agree with that sentiment so general in Liberia to show by persistent effort the capacity of the Negro nation for self government, and therefore would regret the intervention of any foreign government into the affairs of Liberia that would interfere with an experiment that cannot justly be regarded as a failure, since but latterally the Negro has taken his place as "the head and front of this offending," in this land, the legacy of his fathers.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Already Africa has suffered too much from the possession and control of its western confines by

<span class="hr"> </span>

by the European.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your No. 33, dated July 17, 1879, has just been received at this point of my dispatch, as to French protection.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As to the concluding sentence of yours: "The subject is one of interest to this Department, and you are accordingly instructed to promptly report further developements in the matter, and especially whether the tendency of the movement is commercial merely, or with ulterior motives looking to the eventual political control of Liberia."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I quote from the last dispatch of the Liberian Consul, Hon. Leopold Carrance of Bordeaux to the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the Liberian Secretary of State–without comment.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"Allow me to refer once more to the advantages that would accrue to Liberia from the protection of France. The moral effect of such protection would be sufficient to stifle any bad feeling in the neighboring populations. Your commerce would also reap great advantages, for I am sure that the maritime trade of France, trusting in her protecting flag, would take your native produce, and thereby aid to the prosperity and wealth of the country. I have no doubt our honorable President will obtain the consent of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of the legislature to this important matter, which would soon prove to be of the greatest benefit to Liberia both in a commercial and political point of view."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"I shall therefore wait for your orders and those of your Government, in order to resume negotiations at Paris and obtain the best conditions from the French government."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
With considerations of esteem,<br/>
Your obd't serv't<br/>
Jno. H. Smyth<br/>
U.S. Consul Gen'l</p>
