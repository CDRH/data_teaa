      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States<br/>
Zanzibar March 4 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable G. L. Rives<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to address
the Department at this time
in relation to the condition of
affairs on the East Coast of
Africa.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When I took my departure 
from Zanzibar in the 7th
of February, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">1888[?]</span>, every thing
was in a healthy condition
and a large volume of commerce 
was being transacted.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">All of the ports on the mainland 
were open to trade and
it was considered perfectly
safe for Europeans to travel
about anywhere on the vicinity 
of the Coast ports without
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>.
On

<span class="hr"> </span>

On the 27th of March 1888 the 
Sultan Seyid Berghesh died
and his decease was followed
by the accension to the
throne of his brother, Seyid
Khalifa bin Said by right
of succession. Shortly
afterwards, the German East
African Association represented 
by the German Consul
General M. Michahelles, began
pressing the Sultan to put
his signature to a concession,
which had been granted 
by Seyed Berghest: but 
which required the sanction 
of the present Sultan
to become effective.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This concession which is
for a term of Fifty years
makes over to the Association
all the power which the
Sultan possesses in the mainland 
and in all his territories 
and dependencies South
of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of the Umba river. the whole
administration of which is
conceded to and placed in
their hands to be carried
out in the Sultan's home and
under his flag and subject
to the Sultan's sovereign rights.
The association is also granted 
the faculty of levying
taxes upon the people of the
main-land. etc. etc. etc.
It being clearly understood
however that all exercise
of these privileges and powers
shall be in conformity with
existing treaties between the
Sultan and Foreign states.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have reason to
believe that the Sultan
protested repeatedly against
such transfer but was 
eventually co-erced into signing 
the concession—like
his brother before him, who
is reported as saying after 
having

<span class="hr"> </span>

         <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_page tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_reason_image tei_gap">[illegible]</span>

         <span class="hr"> </span>

they were driven out of the
country by the incensed natives.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On or about the 20th
of December 188 the Imperial 
British East Africa
Company through its 
representative, Mr. Mackenzie,
obtained a concession from
the Sultan a concession to that
granted to the German East
African Association and taking 
in the Sultan's territory
up to and beyond Mombassa
The Company is not yet
in working under, but up
to the present time, owing
to good management, they
have met with no violent
opposition from the natives.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The present condition
of affairs on the East Coast
may be summed up as
follows: Trade is utterly
dead. Some hundreds of
the British Indian subjects
who

<span class="hr"> </span>

who acted <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_to tei_unclear_extent_three tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_about tei_unclear_extent_five tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
are ruined. It is rendered 
unsafe for Europeans
or any foreigners to land
at any of the Coast ports.
The blockade entered into
by Germany and England
assisted by Italy and Portugal 
is a cause of distrust to the natives.
And lastly the Sultan
has lost faith in all the
European Governments, but
still puts his trust in
the American Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In regard to the
blockade which was established 
on the 3d of December 
last, in the name of
the Sultan that by his written 
consent &amp; by the German
and English Admirals.
I should be glad to be
informed by the Department
if

<span class="hr"> </span>

if their Blockade <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> the
merchants the right to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
hail and search merchant
vessels flying the American
flag.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In connection with the
blockade the German Admiral 
has recently issued
a proclamation prohibiting
the transportation of food
and provisions to port in
the Coast-line of the German
Association and limiting
native vessels resorting
to these ports to three days
supply of provisions.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the 13th of last month
the Sultan issued a 
proclamation (copy enclosed)
prohibiting his subjects
from dealing in arms and
ammunition and prohibiting
the importation and exportation 
of the same in the Island 
of Zanzibar and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Pemba[?]</span>
I

<span class="hr"> </span>

I have been asked by the
German and English Consuls
General to Co-operate with
them and to enforce the
provisions of the proclamation 
on subjects of this
Consulate. I have not
seen fit to do so as yet.
I await the instructions
of the Department in the
matter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Within the past week
the Sultan has advised me
that he has information that
the German Government 
contemplates the establishment
of a garrison in the town
of Zanzibar. The Sultan
has grave fears not only
for the safety of his own
people but for that of all
the foreigners residing in
the town. I am myself
of opinion that such a
move on the part of Germany 
would

<span class="hr"> </span>

would surely give rise to
complications by which the
safety of all residents
would be imperrilled.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Germany from the
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">first[?]</span> has acted in this
matter in a high-handed
manner: and now, seconded
by England Their actions
are getting to be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>. 
The Sultan hopes
for the moral support at 
least of the United States.
I sincerely hope that this
support may be vouchsafed
by our Government: for it
is a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> fact. That
the sovereign rights of
His Majesty the Sultan
of Zanzibar have been totally 
disregarded and ignored 
and he is practically 
powerless against
further aggressive movements.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I

<span class="hr"> </span>

I will say in closing that
up to the present time American 
interests have suffered 
in common with others
but I have reason to fear
that in the event of the
troubles extending to the
more northern ports. American 
interests will be specially
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">imperilled[?]</span>. This
would appear to be sufficiant 
reason why our Government
might to be a factor 
in the movement which
is now shaping history on
the East Coast of Africa.</p>

Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
