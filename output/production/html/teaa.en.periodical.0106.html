            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p class="tei_p">Virginia P. Jackson's brief poem "Africa" was published in the February 1919 issue of <em class="hi">The Crisis</em>, immediately following an editorial section largely devoted to an argument for decolonizing Africa. Jackson's poem begins with a common trope in African American poetry: that of Africa's calling across the ocean to new world Africans. The poem's speaker addresses her "native land" directly in an apostrophe, expressing her desire to "leave the hate of foster mother, / To be nurtured by thy kindly hand." Here, the poem departs from the sentiment of the aforementioned editorial, which states that "it is as absurd to talk of a return to Africa, merely because that was our home 300 years ago, as it would be to expect the members of the Caucasian race to return to the fastnesses of the Caucasus Mountains from which, it is reputed, they sprang" (166).</p>
