      <p class="tei_p">John G Willis Esq.<br/>
U.S. Commercial Agent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The inclosed abstract 
from my ship's log will sufficiontly
explain itself.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">While on this coast last
voyage in 1857 &amp; 8, we were chased,
fired into with shot guns, hove to
and detained on our voyage on two
different occasions by English
Cruisers. Since then our government
having conveyed to that of the
English an assertion of a plain
and explicit denial of the right
of any foreign ships of war to stop or
detain any merchant ship bearing
the American flag upon the high
seas under any circumstances or
pretense whatever and the English
Government having assented to it
and disclaimed all such right
we had not anticipated, being
again subjected to such shamefull

<span class="hr">Â </span>

disgracefull, troublesome and most 
disagreeable delays involving loss
of time to the ships and pecuniary
loss to her owners which latter is especially
the case on this occasion as our 
mission was urgent its success depending
upon our reaching "Principi" in
time to anticipate the advices for
there <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">per[?]</span> mail steamer "Estephania"
to sail the day after us from Loanda
for St Thomas with mails for "Principi"
to be forwarded from there</p>

      <p class="tei_p">You therefore realise in some measure
how vexatious was the delay to
which we were subjected and the
pecuniary loss involved may be very
considerable</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With full assurance that
we shall meet with welcome and
prompt attention in protection of our
rights our lives and our property
I have the honor to be</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir<br/>
Respectfully<br/>
Yr Ms Obt Svt<br/>
