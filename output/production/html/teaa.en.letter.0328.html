      <p class="tei_p">United States Commercial Agency at Gaboon.<br/>
February 12th 1878.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon William M. Evarts,<br/>
Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Permit me to mention, the pleasing facts, that I have
recently entertained at this Agency, two gentlemen,
English Missionaries, on their return from the Congo,
or Livingston, where they have been taking initiatory
steps, for the establishing a protestant Mission, in the 
vicinity of the first series of rapids, or falls, discovered
by Mr Stanley. Information communicated by these 
gentlemen, tend to confirm reports, that have reached
me recently, that the remnants of the old nefarious
slave Trade still exist, in modified forms, among
the native tribes, between Gaboon &amp; St Paul de Loanda.
Many of the former Agents of the slave Trade, still
remain among the tribes, professedly engaged in
legitimate traffic, who by fraud &amp; violence, obtain
natives, often children, for their own service, &amp; also to
furnish trading establishment with laborers.
And it is believed, that some of these people are still
shipped to the Portugees islands, St Thomas &amp; Prinses.
From these gentlemen, I learn that a British gun boat,
recently captured a Portugees brig, with more than 100
men women &amp; children on board, in a miserable



condition. They had been shipped at some point south
of St Paul de Loando, under the name of free laborers;
for the islands above named. The influence of this
cruel trade upon the natives tribes, is no better
than the old slave Trade; &amp; a catholic priest
sprinkling them with water, under the form of
Baptism, does not change the character of the 
transaction. I have mentioned this matter to W. S. Consul,
Jackson, who is still here, one route for St Paul de Loando
and he will examine into the matter, &amp; report to you in due
time. That the spirit of slave trade still exists; &amp; that unless
carefully watched, it will revive &amp; increase is certain.
On my visit to Washington, I hope to be able to present facts
that will lead the President to change this Commercial
Agency, to a Consulship, with a salary, &amp; extend the
district, from Fernando Po, to the Congo. My acquaintance
with this line of coast, &amp; facilities for occasionally
visiting the different points, are such as I think justify
the charge. The aggregate amount of fees, now received,
are so very small, that nothing but Philanthropic &amp;
Patriotic considerations, induce us to continue to perform
the services, &amp; sustain the responsibilities, &amp; expense of
the office.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir;<br/>
Most Respectfully,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
Albert Bushnell</p>
