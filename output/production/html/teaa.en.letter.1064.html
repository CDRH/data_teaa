      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am informed by the accounting
offices of the Treasury, that a portion
of my salary account is suspended
on the ground of exhaustion of the
appropriation for the payment of
Consular offices, not citizens of
the United States, and I now have
the honor to request that you cause
the Auditor to be informed that such
an objection cannot properly be
urged in my case, for the reason
that I am now and ever have been
a citizen of the United States.
I have exercised the privileges of a
voter in Penna. and have never

exercised like privileges or attempted
to do so anywhere outside of the United
States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Requesting early and favorable
action by the Department in this
matter.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, Sir,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
