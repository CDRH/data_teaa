Washington, Dec. 5, 1888.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Emory H. Taunt, Esqre<br/>
Commercial Agent of the United States<br/>
at Boma, Congo Free State,<br/>
(Now at 1532 J St, N.W,<br/>
Washington, D.C.)</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In addition to the instructions 
heretofore given you in regard to proceeding 
to your post, it is proper for 
me to state that under the act making
appropriations for the diplomatic and 
consular service of the United States for 
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889,
approved July 18, 1888, the provision for 
a
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

a commercial agent at Boma is coupled
with "authority to visit and report upon 
the commercial resources of the upper
and lower Congo basin, their products,
their minerals, their vegetable wealth,
the openings for American trade, and
to collect such information on the subject 
of the country as shall be of 
interest to the United States."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Department is not in a position,
even if it were thought advisable, to 
give you any definite instructions as 
to the extent of your travels in that
region, or as to the special subjects upon
which you should report. The general
direction in which Congress desires
that
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

that inquiries should be made is
sufficiently indicated in the quotation
from the act given above. You will 
bear this authority in mind, and use
your best judgment and discretion
in visiting the various parts of the
Congo basin, and in reporting upon the
subjects which may be of interest to 
the people of this country.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/> 
G. L. Rives<br/>
Assistant Secretary</p>
