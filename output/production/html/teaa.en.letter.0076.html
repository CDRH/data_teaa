      <p class="tei_p">H.M. Ship "Dromedary"<br/>
St. Paul de Loanda 10th April 1864</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In reply to your letter of the 
9th instant relative to giving passage 
to certain Kroomen to Sierra Leone, 
I beg to state that although willing to 
comply with your request as therein stated 
I should not be able to do so without
provision being for their sustenance 
(regularly victualled from this ship)
during the period they are on passage 
which may probably occupy some six weeks 
and for as long a period I do not think 
I should be justified in trusting to the 
Kroomen to victual themselves, as besides 
the irregularity of so doing. Should they 
run short of provisions it would oblige 
me to supply them, and all stories on 
board being Government property I should 
have

         <span class="hr">Â </span>

have to account for them.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">It would be also necessary 
that they should have the means 
of keeping their persons and clothing 
clean.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In conclusion I would beg to 
be allowed to suggest that an official 
application be made through the 
usual channel, and as Captain Peile
the senior officer on this coast is 
here in H.M.S. "Espoir" I have 
no doubt that arrangements may be 
made for the passage required.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
Signed T. S. Helard<br/>
Staff Commander</p>
