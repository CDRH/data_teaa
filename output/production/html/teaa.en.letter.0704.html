      <p class="tei_p">To His Excellency Chester A. Arthur
President of the United States of America</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Your Excellency. We the undersigned, American 
citizens residing in the kingdom of Madagascar
humbly sheweth,</p>    
    
      <p class="tei_p">That for some time differences have existed
between the Government of Madagascar and the 
Government of France. That on May 9th 1883
the French naval forces bombarded and captured
several towns on the northwest coast of this 
island, and on June 10th 1883 the same forces
bombarded and captured Tamatave.</p>   
    
      <p class="tei_p">That they have since occupied these ports, and 
have since bombarded several others, and by their
action and threats have almost ruined the trade 
in the hands of the foreign residents.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">That in consequence of this action of the French
in thus making war upon this country, we
the undersigned have been, and are now being 
greatly damaged and impeded in our lawful pursuit.</p>  
   
      <p class="tei_p">That this state of affairs has existed for more than 
one year during which time the foreign and particularly
the American residents have been the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">primary[?]</span>
sufferers.</p>   

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">That we fear that the total destruction of our
large and valuable interests in this kingdom will
result from this action.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We therefore beg your Excellency, in the interests
of the Americans resident in this island and 
those of our fellow citizens in the U.S. whose
commercial interests are identified with ours, and
in the name of humanity, to interpose the good
offices of the United States in our behalf, to the
end that a speedy mediation and cessation of
hostilities between Madagascar and France may
result, and ourselves be allowed to pursue our
peaceful avocations without further damage or
hindrance.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">And your petitioners will every pray:</p>
