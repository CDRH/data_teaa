      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St Paul de Loanda<br/>
June 29th 1882.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Hon. J. C. Bancroft Davis<br/>
Asst. Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor most respectfully
to request that the U.S. Govt. may
furnish this consulate with a boat
oars and sail. My reasons for asking
such are: that a boat here is the most
essential piece of furniture this Consulate
could have, as to travel by land to the
places under this jurisdiction, in a
Hammock cost too much, and being
a seafearing man, I will be able to
manage a boat to any point of my 
Consular supervision with more speed
and less expenses, when such is required
for the benefits of Americans and the
govt I have the honor to represent here.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
L. de R. du Verge<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
