      <div class="note">Department of State Received Jan 2 1885</div>

      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St Paul de Loanda<br/>
November 11: 1884</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">During the last month 
I have been on a visit along
the coast in one of the mail
steamers as far as Mayumba
and also visited Banana
Landana and Loango and
returned here in H.M.S. Flirt
on the 23rd October, the Captain
having been kind enough 
to give me a passage to Loanda.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As the particulars of my
trip may be of interest to 
the Department I beg to submit
same. At Banana I met Sir

 

Sir Francis de Winton, Chief
Administrator of the International
Association, and from a 
conversation I had with him
he seems anxious to eradicate
certain bad opinions that are
prevalent among the traders
affirming that he is willing
to assist them in every way and
glad to see them going ahead
and following in the footsteps
of the Association, and that 
he has no idea whatever of
putting any difficulty in the
way of any person wishing to
open trade. He is trying to 
get things into good working
order as up to the present
there has been no system whatever 
and

<span class="hr"> </span> 

and a great waste of money.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He talks of a small railway 
from <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Yur[?]</span> to Stanley Pool a
distance of about 230 miles to
open up the country calculating
that the coast would be £2000,000.
but to show any result he would
require a traffic of at least
100 tons a day at freight of
about £4 pr ton. I think this
would be a very bad investment 
as there are not many qualities
of African produce that could
afford to pay such a price unless
it was obtained in the interior 
for mere normal value and 
I must say that I do not see 
where the 100 tons a day are to 
come from.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I

 

I also met here Captain Grant
Elliott, Administrator for
the Association at Loango, and
his idea is a railway from
the Quillo and up the Niarri
valley which would be almost
a direct line to Stanley Pool
and much less expensive as
they would not have such a
mountainous district to go 
through.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Lately[?]</span> in the Congo between
Nokki and Boma the Dutch
House had two factories, one at
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Caicamazio[?]</span> and the other at
Mussuca burnt down by the 
natives, suffering great loss, there
being at the time over 6000 lbs of
ivory and 7 tons of rubber besides 
a

 

a great quantity of goods
for trade; the loss is estimated
at £15,000.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">The Dutch have attacked 
the natives and burnt a number
of villages and taken the King
and Queen of Caicamazio prisoners.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I found the German Man
of War "Moewe" had been at Banana
taking Coal and sailed for Angra
Pequena on the 16th September.
She had Dr Nachtigal on board 
and I heard that a large German
Expedition is reported as about
to start form Angra Pequena
for the Upper Congo, so no doubt
Dr Nachtigal has gone there to
meet them</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At Landana I found the
French

 

French Man of War "Segond" and
the Portuguese Gunboat "Sado"
with the Secretary of the Government
of Angola on board, owing to a 
question between the French
missionaries established there
and the natives about some ground
that they (the missionaries) had
taken charge of, and they had
requested a Man of War to come
to their assistance, as they would 
not recognize the authority of the
Portuguese Delegate who was in 
charge, as Landana was supposed
to be within the Portuguese Protectorate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The first question the French 
took up was that Landana was
within the disputed territory of
5° 12' &amp; 8° south, and after the 
Observations

 

observations had been taken by the
officers of both ships it was determined 
that Landana was not within
the Portuguese Protectorate, but
within the disputed territory, so
the French were perfectly justified
in settling the question with the
missionaries without the interference
of the Portuguese.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The line of 5° 12' south comes
nearly to the south bank of the
Chiloango river, so that Landana
is within the territory of 5° 12' south
and 8° south and the Protectorate
of Massabi and Landana is really
of very little importance as nearly
all the trade is passed through
Landana; no doubt it is a great
disappointment to the Portuguese
but

 

but as they have got a treaty
with the Chief at Landana they
may take charge of it at some
future day. I think it little else
but just that they should as the
natives with few exceptions talk
Portuguese and any palaver
whatever is obliged to be decided
in that language</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At Loango I visited the
merchants and the Chief of the
International Association who
gave some information that may
be useful about the disputed
points on the coast. I therefore
beg to enclose a sketch map.
The colours Ochre show the territory
occupied by the French.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Do Red International Association</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span> 

      <p class="tei_p">Do "Green" which the
French are disputing with the
Association.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Do "Blue" the Portuguese
Protectorate of Massabi and
Landana as it is now admitted
to be.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The red points are places at which
the Association has stations.
At Loango there is a French
Lieutenant and some soldiers
who are in constant questions
with the Association as they claim
the territory from Granville to
Ponta Banda, and are giving
them as much trouble as they
possibly can, as they say they
wish to pay them off here for
the manner in which De Brazza
was

 

was treated by the Association
at Stanley Pool</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On arrival of any vessel on
the coast it is usual for the
Merchant to hoist their flags to 
show their nationality and I was
surprised when I went on shore
accompanied by the captain of 
the Man of War to see the
Merchants hauling down their
flags, and was informed by them
that the French Commandante 
has issued a circular informing
them that they were not allowed 
to hoist flags except on Sundays 
or when the mail steamer came.
Here the houses are two American
and four Portuguese but the trade
is nearly all direct with England
I

 

I noticed at several of the French
places all the Merchants are obliged
to hoist the French flag no matter
what nation they belong to and
I hear that any vessel proceeding
up the river above Gaboon are
obliged to hoist French colors.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Black Point is also a French
station, and there is here established
a sailor and 4 or 5 soldiers, but
is a place of little importance as
to trade. I touched at several other
places on the coast, but I have
nothing of importance to relate
regarding them. Trade is bad
and there are great complaints
all along the coast.</p>
