      <p class="tei_p">Gaboon November 29th 1866</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Gentlemen,</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">Your circular dated 
Nov 26th 1866, having been handed to me 
to-day I hasten to inform you that 
I take into deep consideration the general 
opinion which have dictated it,
but persuaded as I am that the decisions 
of the Admiral Commanding in
Chief have been inspired as much by 
the great interest which he takes in the
countries of which the principal administration 
has been intrusted to him, as 
by a profound knowledge of the means 
of assuring their industrial and commercial 
development, it cannot enter into
my mind to hesitate a moment in executing 
those decisions at the time appointed
and to their full extent.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Never-the-less that period is far distant. 
Many serious reasons lead me to think 
that the Admiral may arrive before 
January 1st of next year, in which 
case you cannot doubt that I will 



lay your Circular beforehand and he 
himself will consider the observations 
which it contains, but are those observations 
sufficiently clearly expressed?</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I do not think so. I believe that a 
serious discussion would put them in 
a better light, at the same time it 
would dissipate certain errors of political
economy, certain impressions 
without any real foundation, which 
appear to me to be shown in the spirit 
of your letter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Consequently I have the honor to 
request that you will call at the Government 
House on monday most at
2 P.M. Assisted by the administrative 
experience of the Ordennateur, inspired
myself by the most earnest desire to 
reconcile your <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>, which 
are in point of fact there of the 
Colony, with the strict execution 
of the orders of the Admiral Commanding 
in Chief perhaps I may 
be able to make you understand 
better both the ideas and the elevated



motives which have dictated his decision.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Finally it is not to be doubted that from
this discussion I shall obtain a deeper
insight into your opinions, and that will 
aid me much in acting as your <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">interpretors[?]</span>
with the Admiral Commanding in Chief.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Be pleased to accept Gentlemen, 
the assurance of my distinguished 
consideration,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Post Captain, officer of the legion 
of honor, Commandant of Gaboon.<br/>
Commandant Superior ad interior,<br/> 
(Signed) Aube</p>

      <span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To<br/>
The Gentleman signing the Circular forwarded to the Commandant Superior of Gaboon</span>
