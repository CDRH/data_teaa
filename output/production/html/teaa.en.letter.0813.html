      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate,<br/>
St. Paul de Loanda,<br/>
October 15th, 1887.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon. Jas D. Porter<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Enclosed please find Form No. 90,
with necessary vouchers.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform the
Department, on my arrival here, that
this Consulate possessed no property
belonging to the Government, except
that mentioned no inventory enclosed
in despatch No. 5, under date of Oct
1st, 1887.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The fact that Vice Consul Newton
is the British Consul and at the
same time head of a large Commercial 
house, has been no reason
for the U.S. Consulate being, in a 
sense, an adjustment, and has removed
any recognized necessity for the

<span class="hr"> </span>

actual possession of the U.S. Consulate
of office accessories.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To enable me to perform the duties
of my office I have been forced by
the exigency, to purchase as per before
mentioned <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Form[?]</span>.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would respectfully advise the
Department that for the expense
of moving archives and for their
proper presentation, a further allowance
is necessary.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To make this purchase I have used
money intended for my family in New York,
and hoping that my action will meet
with approval. I have drawn upon
the Hon Secretary of State for $222.58/100
at 15 d/s in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">favor[?]</span> of Mrs <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Dora[?]</span> Downing
of New York.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Henry F. Downing, Consul</p>
