at St. Paul de Loanda</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Robert Scott Newton<br/>
Vice Consul.<br/>
9th April 1879.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Report on the Trade,
Commerce, Navigation and
Public Works at this Port
from January 1878 to March
1879.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Trade during the 
past year has shown considerable 
improvement over the two
preceding years although not
sufficient to renew the old 
prosperous condition. Provisions
were scarce and the natives
suffered greatly on this account 
but since the beginning of the 
present year native provisions
of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of all descriptions abound
owing to the regular and
plentiful rains. During the 
last four months there has
fallen more rain in and 
around Loanda than has been
known for some five years
inclusive. The surrounding
county looks fresh and green
while the natives are busily
employed in planting, consequently
it is not expected that there
will be any scarcity of provisions
this year.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">One or two Firms have
stopped payment and there
still exists a general want
of confidence. Prices of all 
kinds of Produce in the 
European markets have been
very low, only about equivalent
to what has been paid for it
here, thereby causing heavy losses
which still continue, to fall
on this market.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As

<span class="hr"> </span>

As stated above, since
the beginning of the year the 
rains have been regular, and 
there is even sign that the 
present state of affairs is 
about to be changed for the 
better. The present time offers
a good opportunity for any one
desiring to open up a business
with this market, as no doubt
in a few months there will
be a great scarcity of goods
of all sorts especially Cotton
goods.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The following list of Cotton 
goods principally used in this 
market will be useful for
the guidance of those manufacturers
who may wish to try this market;
Grey Domestics of heavy quality &amp; starched
each piece 30 yards by 25 inches. Selling price $2.70 per piece<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">The above are for the local 
market, and should be of
good quality. Duties are 
about 20% on cash price. These
goods when they come from England
via Lisbon, where they are transhipped
into Portuguese Vessels only pay
70% of the duties, whereas if they 
come in English or American
vessels they have to pay full

      <p class="tei_p">All these should be well starched.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The prices quoted are for a medium
quality

<span class="hr"> </span>

quality of goods, but even a
lower quality of cloth is used
here with advantage.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Many qualities of Handkerchiefs
are also in use, ranging from
12 to 15 Hdkfs per <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">piece[?]</span>.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In Cotton goods, the 
above mentioned cloth may be
considered the staple articles
of Trade.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have several times
procured samples of these
goods for Captains of Vessels
and Traders that have been
here in order to encourage the
Trade as I am of opinion
that American Manufacturers
are quite able to compete
with the English at least in
the better qualities. Several
years ago American goods were
preferred in this Market.
Particular attention should be
paid to the regularity &amp; sizes
of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">pieces[?]</span>. One hundred (100)
pieces

<span class="hr"> </span>

pieces is about the usual 
quantity put up in each 
bale.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In former years
large quantities of Molasses
Rums were shipped from
America to this Port, but
of late this Colony has almost
produced sufficient for its
own consumption. There are 
large Plantations of sugar
cane at Mossamedes, Benguella,
Nova Redondo, Ambriz and in 
the Quanza River, which it is
estimated, have produced in ea: of
the last 3 years about 4500
pipes. This quality of Rum
is much preferred by the natives.
Towards the end of last year 
the cane, owing to the want
of rain, was attacked by a 
small grub, called here the 
"Rosca" and the plantations
all over the Province were 
more or less destroyed causing
great

<span class="hr"> </span>

great loss to the planters.
The small quantity distilled
during the latter months of 
1878, sold for the high price
of Rs 90$000 to Rs 95$000 per
pipe of 130 Gall.$, equal to 
$97.82 to $103.26. This year
the crop is expected to be much
better. Great care should 
be taken by any one shipping
Rum to this part of the 
coast, to see that it is of a 
clear white color, and that 
it is put into casks which
will not in any way discolor
it.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">American Flour which
also used to be shipped largely
to this Port is now thoroughly
discredited, and difficult of 
sale. This is the result of 
American merchants sending
Flour of very low quality.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The following are the 
principal articles of Produce
exported

<span class="hr"> </span>

exported from here, vizt;—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Coffee, Palm Oil, Palm Kernels,
Wax, Rubber, Pea Nuts, Iron,
Adansonian Fibre or Liconde,
Cotton, Orchella Weed, &amp; Gum
Copal.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Coffee. The quality of Angola
Coffee is very inferior <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">to[?]</span> realized
about the lowest price in the 
European markets. At present
it is not worth more than $45/-  
per <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">cut[?]</span> in England. The total 
crop exported from here last
year was about 2500 Tons. The 
quality was better than in former 
years, but owing to the low prices
ruling in Europe, it is feared
the Merchants will lose heavily
on last years purchases, as the 
prices at which the coffee was
bought here were higher than the 
present European prices. If the
market does not improve the
cultivation of coffee will be greatly
neglected, as at present planters 
make

<span class="hr"> </span>

make barely enough to cover
their working expenses. The 
heavy rains we have had this 
year have improved all the 
plantations which are now
looking green and healthy.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Palm Oil. Last years crop was
exceptionally small owing to the 
want of rain. This year, the 
Crop which is about to commence
promises to be a good and
abundant one. The price ruling
here throughout last year was
about Rs 45$000 per pipe
of 950 lbs, equal to about
5 1/4 cents per pound.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Palm Kernels. The above remarks
respecting the crop &amp;c apply 
also to Palm Kernels; the price
has been steady all through
the year at 500 reis per 32 lbs
or say about 55 cents per 32 lbs.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pea Nuts. This article of Export
which in 1868 &amp; 1869 was equal
to 5000 Tons from this port alone
has

<span class="hr"> </span>

has dwindled down to almost
nothing owing to failure of crops
year after year from want
of rains, in fact, there has been
barley enough for the natives
consumption. The prices at which 
it has been sold at for some 
few years past have ranged
as high as $2.75 per arroba, or
per 32 lbs. The current price
where it was exported largely was
only 600 reis per 32 lbs. A considerable 
quantity has been planted 
this season and it may be 
expected that this year Pea 
Nuts will again be a staple
article of export.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Wax. The amount gathered has 
been about the medium quantity.
The prices realized in Lisbon, to 
which port all way from here
is shipped have been very low
and will shew a heavy loss on
shipments. The current price 
here at present is 150 reis, or say 
16

<span class="hr"> </span>

16 cents per lb, formerly it
used to be 250 reis or 27 cents
per lb.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Rubber. The crop has been small.
The reason of this is that the
natives in collecting the Rubber 
have destroyed the greater part
of the trees in places near their
homes and have consequently
a greater distance to go to gather
fresh supplies. If they continue 
their wanton custom of destroying
the trees it is to be feared that 
this article will ere long be a 
very small item in the list
of exports. Price 29 cents per lb.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Ivory. The quantity brought in for
sale has been below the medium
and prices have been well sustained
$1.74 per lb being about the 
average for prime.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Cotton, Orchella Weed, &amp; Gum Copal.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The quantity shipped of these 
articles has been very small
compared with former years.
The

<span class="hr"> </span>

The want of rain is the 
reason why the Cotton Crop
has been so small, and 
the price offered in Europe
for the Orchella weed and 
Gum Copal is, I think, the 
principal reason why these
articles are not shipped to as
large an extent as formerly.
When any article of Produce
gets down to a low price the
natives give up growing or collecting
it as their time is not properly 
paid for.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Adansonian Fibre or Liconde. This is
quite a new article of export
from this port although some
years ago it was largely shipped
from the Northern ports. During
the year 1878 about 8000 Bales
were shipped from here. Owing
to the large quantity sent the 
price has fallen at home
considerably and the latest
quotation of £8.19 per ton, will
it

<span class="hr"> </span>

it is feared prevent the 
natives from gathering it. Lately
the quantity bought has fallen
off very much. The Fibre is
the inner bark of the Baobab
tree which grows here abundantly.
The fibre is torn up into strips
and dried in the sun. Very
good ropes are made from the 
same Fibre by the natives.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Remarks. This Revenue included all 
imports collected in the Custom House.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Public Works. A large amount
of money has been expended
by the staff of Engineers and 
Workmen sent out in 1877 to
commence a line of Railway 
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to the interior passing thro'
the Coffee districts, and for
general improvements in the
Province but, for the money
spent, little or no result is 
shewn beyond a single line of
Telegraph from Loanda to 
Calumba in the Quanza River,
a distance of 21 miles, and then
continued along the banks of the 
River for about 25 miles to a
place called Cunga. During
this rainy season the last mentioned
part of the line has been 
rendered useless on accont of 
the Posts having in many places
fallen down. A road from Loanda
to the River Dande has been 
commenced, but only a cutting
of about 2 miles in length has
been made as yet.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The fine new Hospital
begun in 1875/6 &amp; mentioned
in my report for that year,
is still far from being completed,
and

<span class="hr"> </span>

and the other improvements
such as a new wharf of
sufficient size to allow large
vessels to get along side; and
better means of conveying fresh
water to this from the River
Bengo, also contemplated at 
that time have not yet been
commenced.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A considerable portion
of the money granted has also
been used in the erection and 
fitting up of work shops which
are being built of very large
extent and in a style which
is thought to be far superior 
to the requirements of the Province.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The useless and extravagant 
manner in which money
has been squandered is causing
much public criticism in Lisbon
when the time (3 years) for which
the employes were engaged expires
I believe the greater part of them 
will go home as they are also 
disgusted

<span class="hr"> </span>

disgusted with the work done
and are tired of their service 
here.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Emigration. During the past year
Emigrants or as they are called
here "Colonos" have been sent
regularly from the province to
the Island of St. Thomas.
Between January &amp; December
1878, 869 natives of both 
sexes were shipped from Loanda
and 574 from Nova Redondo.
Contractors appointed by Governments,
situated at several places
in the interior engage these people,
or in fact ransom them, as
generally they are slaves from the 
far interior, and they are thus
liberated. They are often brought 
in half starved, and are well
treated by the Contractors, and
as a rule they proceed to St
Thomas with the greatest pleasure.
They go under Contracts of from
2 to 5 years, all of which are made
before

<span class="hr"> </span>

before the Government Agents,
and the Government do everything 
in their power to see that
the law is not abused. Certain
conditions are made as to dress,
food, &amp;c. and they are asked 
if they go of their own free will
before they are allowed to leave
the province. Every thing is done 
to secure good provisions for them
during the voyage, and the vessels
conveying them are thoroughly examined
before they are allowed to leave
the port and are obliged to
carry a medical man. No vessel
is allowed to carry more than
1 person for every 2 tons Register.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Camara Municipae or Town Council.
Great complaints have of late
been made against the corporation 
as the city is reported to be
in such a dirty condition as
has not been known for years. the
heavy rains having carried the 
sands down from the surrounding
high

<span class="hr"> </span>

high land in all directions
and some of the streets have
over 2 feet of sand in them.
The medical men say that
the city has not been so
unhealthy for some time past
and within the last few days
there have been several cases of 
Fulminant Fever, which have
carried off the victims in a 
few hours. Intermittent fever is
also very prevalent a present.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The only American Vessel
in port just now is the Brigantine 
"Julia F. Carney" of Boston.
She brought a large cargo of 
Petroleum, Flour and Lumber &amp;c.
but will not dispose of much 
in this Port</p>
