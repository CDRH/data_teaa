      <p class="tei_p">United States Commercial Agency
at Gaboon.<br/>
January 23d 1878.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon William M. Evarts<br/> 
Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, 
D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit herewith to the Department, 
copies of the action, recently taken by the Gaboon, and Corisco
Mission, and the Corisco Presbytery; relating to a certain 
William Schorsch, who has threatened, I understand 
to complain of my action in his case. He has threatened 
the French Commandant in a similar manor.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">As he was not an American citizen, I had no occasion 
to act officially in reference to him; and only acted 
with my associates, ecclesiastically, when duty 
demanded such cooperating. He has left Gaboon 
&amp; gone to Corisco, a Spanish island, but still 
retains the hallucination, that he has a right to our 
property support &amp;c.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/> 
Sir<br/>
Most Respectfully,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant,<br/> 
Albert Bushnell<br/>
United S. Com. Agent</p>

Wednesday January 2nd 1878</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This petition respectfully represents that we request your 
Excellency's interference on our behalf against a certain Wilhelm
Schorsch, at present living in the Gaboon jurisdictions.
The said Wilhelm Schorsch, although not a naturalized
American citizen, was formally an authorised member of our 
mission under the direction of the Presbyterian Board of 
Missions in America. But on account of his unquestioned
insanity, he was recalled by the said Board and 
dismissed from its service. After partially recovering his 
health in an Insane Asylum in England, he has,
on his own responsibility, returned to the Gaboon, against 
our protest, against the wish of the Board, and without 
its authority. We see already unmistakable indications 
of his continued insanity: Wherefore, we pray your 
immediate interference for our protection and relief.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">And your petitioners will ever pray<br/> 
R. H. Nassau Che. of Mission,<br/> 
A. Bushnell, sec'y &amp; Treasurer<br/> 
C De Heer,<br/>
Saml H. Murphy.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Commandant Superior, Gaboon.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Baraka, Gaboon W. A.<br/>
Monday January 7, 1878</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Whereas: The Rev Wm Schorsch, a member of the Presbytery
has for two years been absent from our meetings in a deranged
mental state in Germany, England, and America;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">And, Whereas:- He is now in the hands of the civil authorities 
of Gaboon, unable to meet with us, his violent conduct 
toward his missionary brethren having compelled civil 
proceedings against him; And Whereas;- that violent
conduct,- slanderous language, and abusive manner 
have become so scandelous and immoral in their indirect
and direct influence on his ministerial character, and so 
injurious to our mission work as to justify judicial 
proceedings by this Presbytery, and deposition from his
ministerial office,- from which proceedings we however
refrain, on the ground of his deranged mental condition 
making him not fully responsible,- Therefore, Resolved:-</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the said Mr Schorsch is unfit to exercise any
ecclesiastical right or function, and that his name be 
dropped from the roll of this Presbytery unanimously 
carried by the affirmative votes on roll call of the entire 
Presbytery. Rev Messrs Bushnell, De Heer, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Ibia[?]</span>, Murphy, 
Nassau, Elders Truman &amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Itongolo[?]</span>
      </p>
