Daniel Freethey who takes
Oath as follows viz:
I shipped as 2nd Mate of
The American Bark Jennie
R. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Duvrty[?]</span> Weed Master
at the Port of Boston on or
about July 31st 1880. for
the West Coast of Africa
The Bark touched at <del>Cape</del> St
Vincent Cape De Verde Islands
thence to Monrovia Liberia
where we arrived on or about
Sept 10th thence to Grand
Bassa and Cape Palmas.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At the latter place the Captain being
on shore one night attending to business
the Mate Harry Miller being 
in command had plenty of liquor
which he drank &amp; gave the men
he went forward, drank



sang &amp; danced with the men
in the forecastle until I finally
succeeded in getting from aft
into the cabin - when shortly
he became crazy - tore every
particle of clothing off broke
glass ware, clocks, overturned
various articles in the cabin
and had to be carefully watched
for 3 or 4 hours until he finally 
became exhausted and sank on
the floor of the cabin - perfectly nude
This took place in the night with a
heavy wind blowing and only
one anchor down - &amp; I alone the
Steward half drunk - not knowing
when I would be obliged to go
forward &amp; let go the other
anchor - fearing also to cease
guard over the mate in the cabin
for fear he might get over
board or do some damage
Several Sailors also drunk from
Liquor furnished them by the
Mate and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> disorder 

<span class="hr"> </span>

prevailed - About Six days after
this a similar occurence took
place - finally I told the Captain
all that had taken place
and told him I wanted to leave the 
vessel. The Captain said he could
not discharge me and if I left
the vessel he must not know
anything about it - but afterward
he took me aboard the S.S.
Ethiopia in his own boast at
Cape Palmas Oct 21st and
bid me good bye. I paid
my own fare to Sierra Leone</p>

Sierra Leone Oct. 25th 1880.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Personally appeared before me
at my office on the day above
written Frank Withers and
Chas Worrell and made oath to
the following viz:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We shipped on board the
American Bark "Jennie R. Deverty" 
as Able Seamen at the Port of
Boston U.S.A. July 31st 1880.
bound for the West Coast of Africa
Weed Master.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Arrived at Monrovia Liberia
(having touched at St. Vincent Cape
De Verde Islands) on or about
Sept 10th thence to Grand Bassa
and Cape Palmas.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The food furnished us was not 
properly cooked after me left St.
Vincent as the Steward was nearly
all the time under the influence of
Liquor as a large portion of the
Cargo consisted of Rum



we informed the Captain that the
food was very bad - not properly
cooked &amp; he said he would attend to
it - but was overheard to tell the
Steward - the men want their food
cooked better but you can do as
you are a mind to.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Withers was Sick two weeks before
he left the vessel - &amp; when he got 
better he told the Captain he could
not stand it &amp; must go ashore
and the Captain &amp; 1st Mate Harry
Miller took ashore at Grand
Bassa Oct. 5th and there we saw
the U.S. Commercial Agent Mr
Williams who advised us to
return to the Bark - but we replied
we would rather die on shore than
go back aboard the vessel.
We remained ashore and saw the
Captain frequently and neither
he nor the Commercial Agent
Mr Williams took any positive
measures - to compel us to
return to the vessel and



we remained ashore until the
arrival of the S.S. Ethiopia
Oct. 23rd when the Commercial
Agent Mr Williams procured
our passage to Sierra Leone</p>
