have requested that another one be
sent to you, to be kept until I
submit my Report for the Quarter, that
it may be included in the contingent
expenses for this Quarter.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As I have three Daily papers on
my personal list I have requested
that the Herald be discontinued that
I may have the Weekly Tribune and
London Times (Weekly) instead.</p>
