      <div class="note">Received Dec 25 1866</div>

      <p class="tei_p">F. W. Seward Esqr<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your
communication of the 21st ult in reply to mine of
the 14th has been received.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am requested
to inform the Department why my <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">account for[?]</span>
rent of Office was not presented quarterly</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote to the 
Department while in Africa in regard the rent of 
the Office and received for answer that if I would procure
and forward to the Department a certificate signed 
by two respectable merchants to the effect that <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_or tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> 
built an office and used said Office expressly for 
Governement purposes one for no other. That upon 
receipt of such a certificate the Department would 
inform me of its decision. I immediately forwarded 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Gordon[?]</span> &amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Bremmer[?]</span> certifying to the above facts also 
certifying that in their judgment the rent of said 
Office was worth one hundred and fifty dollars 
per annum. I never received any reply to the
certificate. I delayed writing again in regard to this 
matter not wishing to call attention again to the subject which
I supposed was already under consideration.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I disliked too to press the claim after once fairly presenting 
it at a time when it seemed to me you must 
have so much of greater importance to occupy your 
attention. Another <del>diffi</del> reason too was the difficulty 
experienced in that far off out of the way country in 
getting drafts cashed without paying such extreme
rates of exchange &amp; then perhaps not at all.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The above are the plainly stated reasons 



why I did not present <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">quartly[?]</span> accounts &amp; collect next 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">quartly[?]</span> for my Office. I am quite sure I want nothing
but what is just and honorable in the matter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your 
Communication states that my account cannot be
allowed until proper vouchers are furnished the
Department. The voucher before refered to as 
having been signed by Messrs Gordon &amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Bremmer[?]</span> I think 
must have been received by the Department if so please
inform me <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">what[?]</span> other vouchers are necessary. If said
voucher was not received please inform me; and I 
would most respectfully request your indulgence
in this matter as I have no dates of communications
written while in Africa</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir with the highest 
consideration your most humble 
&amp; obedent servant<br/> 
Henry May<br/>
Late U.S. Comml. Agt.<br/>
at Gaboon River W. A.<br/> 
Now at Ames Story County Iowa<br/>
December 21st 1866</p>
