      <p class="tei_p">United States Commercial Agency at Gaboon.<br/>
February 9th 1878.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon. William M. Evarts<br/>
Secretary of State.<br/> 
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">I am happy to inform the Department, that I am 
encouraged to expect an increase of American commerce 
at this port. A circular has just been received, stating that 
"the long established house of Messrs Mansfield &amp; Roberts,
127 state street Boston, propose to open &amp; extend a permanent 
business on the coast; &amp; that one of their large Barks may be 
expected at Gaboon about the 1st of March, with a general 
cargo." The French Commandant has just informed me
of the probibility, that the Government will soon build a 
large En-tre-po at Gaboon, for the convenience of commerce;
which will vastly increase the business at this port &amp;
make it a great commercial center, for West Equatorial
Africa. During my anticipated visit to the United States,
I hope to interest our Merchants in African commerce;
which Christian Civilization is rapidly developing 
as well as philanthropists &amp; christians in the great work 
of African exploration &amp; christianization. I have a 
Revised Grammar &amp; Dictionary of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Mponguic[?]</span> language.
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">I[?]</span> send a translation of more than 20 books of the Bible, to

<span class="hr"> </span>

publish at the Bible House in New York; while 
recruiting my much enfeebled strength.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir;<br/> 
Most Respectfully,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant;<br/>
Albert Bushnell<br/>
U.S. Coml Agent.</p>
