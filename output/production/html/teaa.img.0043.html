<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Born enslaved in 1815 in the state of Maryland, Henry Highland Garnet escaped from slavery as a child with his family and relocated to New York. Despite their legal status as "fugitives," the Garnets raised Henry in freedom, sending him to the African Free School in New York City, their new metropolitan residence. Through attending the school, Garnet learned the skills of literacy and numeracy. The school's curriculum was designed to empower Black children to function successfully in the United States, however, by the mid-nineteenth century, school leaders began advocating African American emigration to Liberia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Garnet eventually served as United States Minister and Consul General to Liberia for a few months, from December 1881 to February 1882, dying there on the 13th. While Garnet did not reside in Liberia long, his career was emblematic of those African Americans who believed that there was an inextricable link between people of African descent in America and Africans.</p>
