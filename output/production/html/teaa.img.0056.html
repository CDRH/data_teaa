<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Anna Boardman Smith described the mission house as being located "in the African bush about one hundred and twenty-five miles from the sea-coast" (82). The house had three floors (2&#xBD; stories), divided as follows: a schoolroom, chapel, and small storeroom on the first floor; three bedrooms and a parlor on the second floor; a "sleeping room" for the "mission girls" and a storage room on the third floor. The mission house also included a front and back porch, the latter was enclosed and contained the kitchen and bathroom. The house was the center of the broader "mission yard," comprised of a dining room and cook house for the children, a "boys' sleeping house," and a house for the workmen. Smith's description of the spatial arrangement of the mission emphasized the intimate physical spaces where the children interacted with one another, while maintaining same-sex segregation, and the places where missionaries conducted their "soul saving" work. Overall, Smith paints a bucolic scene of the mission house and its grounds. "The ground slopes gradually away from the house on every side and is thickly dotted with palms while to our right as we stand upon the front porch, is a rare old cotton tree and to our left only farther away another; these lift their mammoth arms against the sky and seem like huge old sentinels keeping watch over our home" (82).</p>
