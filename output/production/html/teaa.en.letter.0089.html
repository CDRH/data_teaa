      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate at St Thomé &amp; Principe West Africa<br/>
St Thomé July 29th 1869</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honble Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I have had the honor
to inform you, I have been recognized by
the Provincial Government, and begun the
discharge of my official duties.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On making application to the former
Consular Officer, for whatever United States
property he might have in his hand, I was
told he was absent, and that nothing existed
but some blanks, that he should shortly
return, and that the blanks should be then
delivered to me. In the mean time I have
to make a requisition for a Flag, Coat
of Arms, seal, press, stationary, United 
States Treaty, and everything else that
is necessary and that is generally forwarded
to every consulate. I have just 
received via Fernando Po several books
as shown by enclosed list.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I should like to be informed, if
packages adressed to this consulate, coming
through the consulate are subject to duties,
I mean only what bonafide belongs
to the consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I should also like to know, how

<span class="hr"> </span>

I am going to charge for Post Office Expenses,
as there are generally some charges on all packages.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am getting up a Map of
the Commercial business of last year
as shown by the Imports and Exports. As 
soon as ready, I shall forward it to the
Department of State.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hoping that you will give kind attention
to my requisition, I have the honor
to remain with great respect.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your Most Obedt Servant<br/>
D. L. Marsins</p>

      <span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To the
Honble Hamilton Fish.<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington
D.C.</span>
