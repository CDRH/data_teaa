      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge 
receipt of the Department Circular #5 
dated at Washington March 6th 1871 
and now transmit herewith a statement 
of all the information obtainable, 
as required by the Schedule 
accompanying the above circular 
intended for the U.S. Hydrographic 
Office. viz.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">1st No charts published by local authorities</p>
      <p class="tei_p">2d The entrance to the Sierra Leone 
River is obstructed by an extensive 
sand bank called the Middle 
Ground, which in many parts 
is dry at low water - there 
is a passage on either side
of it.

of it.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The northern passage is only 
fit for small vessels &amp; by them 
seldom attempted. The principal 
channel lies between Cape Sierra 
Leone and this bank, having a 
clear passage of more than a mile 
in breadth, carrying a depth 
of from 5 to 12 fathoms.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Carpenter Rock the only danger 
on the Southern Shore lies W. 1/4 N. 
mile distant from N.W. extremity 
of the Cape, it shows at half-tide 
and may be easily distinguished 
by its breakers, and 
it should be well borne in 
mind that both Flood &amp; ebb tides 
set directly upon it.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the extremity of Cape Sierra 
Leone a light house 69 ft. high 
was errected in 1849 in which is 
a fixed light, visible 9 miles 
in clear weather, it stands in 
8° 30 N. and 13° 17' 45" W., and 
bears from Carpenter Rock W. 1/2 N.

in 8° 30 N. with 9 or 10 fathoms of 
water, they will be about 4 leagues 
from shore, or if the weather be 
clear they will have seen the high 
land - which should be brought to 
bear E.S.E.; and when about 4 or 
5 leagues from the land, the Cape 
will be seen making like a low 
point, with a ridge of Cocoa
