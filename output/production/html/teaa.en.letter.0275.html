      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to forward 
you reports for the 
quarters ending 31st March, 
and 30th June respectively. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">A want of blank forms prevented 
taking advantage of an 
earlier opportunity. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">For the quarter ending June 30th 
American goods, to the amount of 
$75000.00, have been imported in 
British vessels, which were, formerly, 
American vessels; the return cargoes 
of these vessels consisting of African 
productions amounted to 
about $70,000.00.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to request that a parcel 
containing the forms required 
for the verification of Invoices in 
accordance with the Act of March 
3rd 1863 may be supplied to this office.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
