      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you 
that I have arrived at Stanley
Pool on my way to the interior
of the Kongo Free State, having
left Matadi August 29th with 
a caravan of one hundred and 
four men.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I shall leave this place Oct 13th
for Loulouabourg on the Kassai
River distant eight hundred and 
seventy five miles, and shall be 
back at the Pool probably 
next June. I shall next visit the 
Oubanghi River, and hope to arrive 
at Stanley Falls this time
next year. From the Falls I shall
go to the Eastern Boundary of this

<span class="hr"> </span>

this state which is Lake Tanganyika
upon arrived at Tanganyika I shall
devote several months to the Katanga 
Country, and if I find communication
with the Kongo River cut off
shall go with an Arab caravan to 
Bagamayo on the East Coast <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> 
Zanzibar, as the most 
expeditious, and safest route
out.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As far as possible I shall keep 
the Department informed of my 
movements, but as mail communication 
in the interior is not good
long lapses must occur in my
correspondence.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">My Report on the Lower and 
Upper Kongo will be submitted
upon completion of the work 
assigned me.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/> 
Respectfully<br/>
R. Dorsey Mohun<br/>
