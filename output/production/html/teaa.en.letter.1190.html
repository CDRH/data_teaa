Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
WASHINGTON, D. C.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab_type_letterhead tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor of submitting
to you the following:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The building now used for
Legation and Consular purposes is in charge
of the Administrator of J. K. Sharp's
estate and he informed the Vice Consul
as well as myself that sometime in the
near future the widow will want the
building for her own use.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In view of this fact I have in contemplation
the renting of one of two buildings
more centrally located, on higher ground,
and much healthier than the one we now
occupy. One is two story brick
owned by the M. E. Missionary Board,
and is the more desirable; the other is
the residence of Ex-President Roberts,
a two-story

<span class="hr"> </span>

a two story brick, and only two doors
from the one owned by the Missionary
Board. Am satisfied that I can
get Ex-President Roberts's house for the
same rent we are now paying but do
not yet know whether the other can be
rented. If so, the rent ought to be about
the same in either case.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Do you wish to advise me in regard
to the matter or shall I go ahead and
make the best arrangements possible?</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I send a copy of this Despatch to
the Diplomatic Bureau also.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your obedient servant,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">William D. McCoy,<br/>
Minister-Resident
and Consul-General</p>
