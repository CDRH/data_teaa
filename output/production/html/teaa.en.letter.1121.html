Monrovia, Liberia, November 5th 1889.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor respectfully to
call the attention of the Department
to the vacancies that exist in the
Agencies of the United States at Cape Palmas
and Grand Bassa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It appears that formerly our
Government had Agents at the points mentioned,
and that at the present, there remains
at them some of the Government's
archives.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Having not visited these ports; nor
having been advised respecting the
quantity or condition of the archives,
which there may be at Grand Bassa
and Cape Palmas, I do not know
in what they consist.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am not informed as to the extent

<span class="hr"> </span>

of exports from the points in
question to the United States, therefore,
make no recommendation with reference
to the appointment of Agents
there.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I shall await the pleasure of
the Department for instruction
as regards the archives to which
allusion is above made.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, sir,<br/>
your obedient servant<br/>
Ezekiel E. Smith,<br/>
U.S. Consul General.</p>
