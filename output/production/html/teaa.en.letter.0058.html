      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge 
the reception of your 
Despatch No 2. with enclosures, requesting
information on a claim 
preferred by a British Seaman 
named George Frank, for the sum
of £9.17.6.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To facilitate the information,
I enclose George Frank's 
Account Current with the late 
Commercial Agent, taken from 
the Relief Book which shows 
a balance due him of $35.50 
and not £9.17.6. as represented 
by the British Consul at this 
city

         <span class="hr"> </span>

city.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The difference of amounts 
arise from not deducting one 
month's extra wages in accordance 
with the laws of United States' 
Consulates, and for not charging 
George Frank with Vouch No. 3 &amp; 4.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I respectfully enclose 
Vouchers No 1 to 5. Number 5 being 
only a copy the original having 
been misplaced by my predecessor,
as every place in the 
Agency has been searched for 
it the past two days. As 
the British Vice Consul took 
a copy of the original as seen 
by the enclosures forwarded 
to this Agency by the Depart
-ment

-ment, there cannot be any 
doubt as to its correctness.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor<br/>
to be<br/>
Your Most Obd't Serv't<br/>

Commercial Agent</p>
