  <p><em>The Voice of the People</em> was a Black newspaper founded in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1901 by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, who described the paper as the "Organ of the Colored National Emigration Society."</p>

<p>This image encapsulates the relationship between the United States and Africa as mediated through African American experiences during Reconstruction, the Gilded Age, and the Progressive Era. Subtitled "Emigration or Extermination Awaits the Black Man," the 1901 drawing depicts the United States as a land of "disenfranchisement," "oppression," "degradation," and "no civil rights" upheld by "barbarous decisions by the Supreme Court," presumably including the 1896 <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> case, decided only five years earlier. Images of lynchings, race riots/massacres, and segregated public accommodations visualize the daily realities of Black oppression. In contrast, West Africa represents "the Great Future of the Race," which includes "liberty," "manhood," "self-reliance," "prosperity," "happiness," and "Christianity." The sketch embodies a strain of Pan-Africanist thought spanning the time-period of this study (1862-1919) that posited that only emigration to Africa (beyond just Liberia) would save African Americans from physical, social, economic, and political "extermination."</p>
