            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p class="tei_p">Bert Williams and George Walker, a famous African American blackface duo, performed in <em class="hi">Abyssinia</em>, written by Jesse A. Shipp and Alex Rogers, with music by Williams and Will Marion Cook. The show toured the United States, often to sold-out crowds, featuring "a cast of over one hundred, lavish costumes and lighting effects, a manmade waterfall and wild animals." Williams and Walker played the roles of Jasmine Jenkins and Rastus Johnson, respectively, the latter of whom has won a lottery and spends his winnings traveling to Abyssinia with his friend. During their travels through the country, they are mistaken for Ethiopian royalty and find themselves in trouble, appearing before the court of Ethiopia's Emperor Menelik. Although a relatively minor character in terms of time on stage, Menelik hovers over the production; his portrait, reproduced on a coin, serves as the central image on the show's songbooks, above smaller portraits of Williams and Walker. In addition, one review of <em class="hi">Abyssinia</em> called the role of Menelik in the show "the dream of the Negro actor." <em class="hi">Abyssinia</em> depicts Menelik as a cruel and merciless ruler. He is shown sentencing a "rebellious chief" to death by dismemberment, after which the emperor would "feed his body to the Hyenas, as a warning to any and all who shall attempt to defy the mandates of Menelik, the second King of Kings of Ethiopia." In contrast, the younger generation of Ethiopian leaders, such as Bolasso, are depicted as modern paragons of Westernized military training. The tension between the older and younger generation can be seen from the beginning of the play, which opens with a song called "Janhoi," or emperor. (The term appears first in a prefatory glossary—more evidence of the writers' research—that defines "Abyssinian words used throughout the play").</p>

Those that nature has seen fit to make fat, go days at a time without food and allow themselves to be fastened in cages over tanks of hot water, in order to melt the fat, so that they can become thin, and the thin ones stay in bed and eat oats, the same kind of oats horses eat, also some strange kind of nuts made of grapes. Along with this, they are ordered by their medicine man to laugh so that they may grow fat, fancy this? After they reach the age of twenty-five years, they don't have any more birth-days for three years, and then they are only twenty-six years old, and when by this process, twenty-eight years have been reached, no more birth-days are celebrated, isn't funny?</p>

Class one: incandescent bodies which shine by their own light. Class two: opaque bodies which are visible only by reflecting the light of some incandescent body in their neighborhood. Now the three fundamental facts which determine the phenomena of Astronomy are: The Globular form of the earth, its diurnal rotation on its axis and its annual revolution around the sun. To represent the position of the stars, astronomers imagine circles on the Celestial sphere, corresponding to the circles of longitude and latitude on the earth. To explain to you longitude and latitude, the Meridian of Greenwich, Celestial meridians and the like, would be a waste of time, but I might be able to interest you----</p>
