            <h3>Analysis</h3>

            <p class="tei_p">Born Cincinnatus Hiner Miller, Joaquin Miller lived a life of adventure and was one of the best known Western American poets of the nineteenth century. One of many poems he wrote about the continent, "Africa" was published in 1875 and republished many times thereafter. The poem's speaker is struck "dumb with awe and wonderment" by the ancient majesty he finds in the face of an old enslaved woman, "a face like Africa's." Unlike Walt Whitman's similar "Ethiopia Saluting the Colors," which also features an abstracted old black woman who symbolizes Africa, Miller takes a passionate stand against the "turbid flood / Of prejudice [that] lies stagnant still, / And all the world is tainted." Miller's poem celebrates the "histories of her great race," including the Sphinx, pyramids, and obelisks; even "her humblest ruins are sublime," whereas the songs praising relatively young and brutal European histories "strike idly out of place" in comparison.</p>
