Asst. Secy of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Dispatch No 3. 
under date of the 15th Ultimo 
endorsing to me Special Passport 
No 538 and under separate cover 
a copy of the Consular Regulations 
1874 together with a Register of 
the Department.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">Having taken 
charge of the U.S. Consulate here 
on the 16th Instant. I have to 
Report, that I find the Archives 
of the office in a very bad and 
disorganized condition.
No letters nor papers of any kind 
have been filed or bound in 
the past five years or more 
but thrown in a box like waste. 

<span class="hr"> </span>

There are no chairs, table, nor 
desk, belonging to the Consulate 
not even a cheap case for the 
Books (which are large leather bound 
and expensive) but they are allowed 
to be thrown about and liable to 
damage in various ways. 
I purpose to have all papers 
properly filed and bound and 
to have a suitable case made 
for the protection of the U.S. 
Consular Books. shall also provide 
suitable table and chairs 
for the office will see the propriety
of the above action on my 
part and allow me the actual 
expense attending the same. 
In accordance with Par. 353 of 
the Consular Regulations I would 
respectfully ask permission of the Dept 
for the procuring of these necessary 
articles to become permanently 
the property of the Consulate.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">In accordance with the Regulations 
Par. 13. and 19. and instructions 
received from the Department under 
date of Aug 15th I would respectfully 
make the following statement
and recommendation regarding
the Vice Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The present Vice Consul
Mr. Rudolph Camelberg never
has been and never can be
of any possible use to this
Consulate. from the fact he
has not resided at this place
during the past two years and
is now residing at Sherbro
more than 60 miles distant.
I would therefore respectfully
recommend for Vice Consul
subject to the approval of the 
Department
Captain Marcellus William Tobey
an American citizen who has been
in the Merchantile business here
for the past four years. he 
is a ship Master 38 years of
age

<span class="hr"> </span>

age and was born in Massachusetts
(and appointed from same state)
He is now absent in the United
States but will soon be returning
to this place. If the Dept. approves
the above recommendation I would
suggest the sending of his blank Bond
and Instructions to his address
No 115 Wall Street New York care of
Mess. Yates and Porterfield and if he
(Tobey) has not already sailed
he will furnish the required Bond
at once and in case he has sailed
Mess. Y. and P. will forward the
same to him.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I send you
herewith Inventory of the U.S.
Consulate at Sierra Leone.</p>
