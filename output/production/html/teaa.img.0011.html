<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>An article in the December 1913 issue of <em>The Crisis</em> declares that the "greatest of all" the entertainments accompanying the New York Emancipation Exposition "was the historical pageant," later known as <em>The Star of Ethiopia</em>, which became "a great popular festival with 350 actors living their parts.  Its imagery and beauty have seldom been surpassed."</p>
