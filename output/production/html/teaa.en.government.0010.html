         <p class="tei_p">1. There shall be established an international commission of
exploration and civilisation of Central Africa, and national
committees which shall keep themselves in communication
with the commission with the view of centralising, as far
as possible, the efforts made by their fellow-countrymen,
and to facilitate, by their co-operation, the execution of the
resolutions of the commission.</p>
         <span class="hr">Â </span>
         <p class="tei_p">2. The national committees constitute themselves in such
manner as may seem to them preferable.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">3. The commission shall be composed of the presidents of the
principal geographical society which are represented at
the Conference of Brussels, or who may subsequently give
in their adherence to its programme, and of two members
chosen by each national committee.</p>
