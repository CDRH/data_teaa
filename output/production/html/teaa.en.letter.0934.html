      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit herewith for the information of the Department, marked inclosure No. 1. a copy of a note which was received by me at this place, today, conveying to me from Messrs Pettengill and Everett, agents at Salt Pond, West Coast of Africa, for Messrs Mansfield and Roberts of Boston Massachusetts, the protest of the said Pettengill and Everett against a decision rendered by certain courts of Her Majesty's colonial settlements of Sera and the Gold Coast, West Africa.

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/>
U.S. Minister<br/>
Liberia</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We James J Pettengill &amp; Robert Everett agents on the West Coast Africa for the firm of Roberts &amp; Mansfield Boston Mass U.S.A. having suffered much inconvenience and severe pecuniary losses in business. Through the "in one oppinion" unjust decision of the Courts at Cape Coast and Accra in the Mutiny Case of the Bark Bolivia of Boston and in Subsequently taking the chief mate by force from same vessel, discharging him and compelling the master to pay his passage home by steamer, do by this protest and petition against the acts and decision of the Courts in the above cases and trust your Excellency will take an early opportunity of ascertaining the particulars of the case and give us the same Justice as would be accorded to British subjects in a British Court.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">First "We object to the decision of the Court at Cape Coast

<span class="hr"> </span>

in trying the crew of the American Bark Bolivia acused of mutiny" for simple assault and after being found guilty by the Jury having been discharged by the Court without passing any sentence and ordered to be discharged from the vessel, when as it is our oppinion they should have been returned to the vessel to complete the voyage.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Second "We object to the acts and decision of the Court at Accra in taken the Chief Mate out of the sad vessel on a summons for debt, as we believe it is according to law, that payment can not be collected for debt contracted by any sailor belonging to any ship unless the contraction of the debt was sanctioned by the master.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We further object to a doctor in the service of the Colonial Government giving the said Mate a certificate stating he is sick and must go home and then the same doctor going into Court in the capacity of magistrates and acting Judge and compelling the Master of said vessel to discharge said Mate pay his debts and send him home by steamer.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">We object to the second case because even supposing the Mate to have been very sick and needed to go home, we had at that very time a vessel ready to leave for the the United States and might have saved expenses, moreover we are of oppinion that the Court exeded its authorities in taking the Mate out of an American vessel, he having in no way offended against the laws of the Country and discharging him simply on account of alledge sickness. and by the above acts and decission disabling the ship she having only the Master and second Officer on board.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We beg to inform your Excellency That a copy of this has been sent to the Secretary of State at Washington and one to U.S. Minister at Liberia</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Gentlemen</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your note dated July 4th 1876 and protesting to me against certain decisions of Her Majestys Courts at Acra &amp; Cape Coast West Africa, as that decision was rendered in a case in which you appear to have been the defendants, was only received by me to day at this place where I am now spending a leave of absence. In reply, I have to inform you that the Colonial settlements at which the Courts of whose decision you complain are located, are not within my Official Jurisdiction and therefore your case is not within my

<span class="hr"> </span>

my Official purview. I am therefore unable to see in what manner I am able to assist your request to have the Justice of that decision investigated, unless it be that I may do what it appears from your note you have already done, and what I will do this day, viz: bring your petition to the notice of the Department of State at Washington.</p>
