      <p class="tei_p">US Consulate, Goree-Dakar<br/>
July 13th 1885</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/>
James D Porter<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Before discussing the
subject of the appointment of 
a successor for Mr Armand,
I desire respectfully to call the 
attention of the Department
with a view to some explanation
of the enclosed copies of letters
received at this Consulate form 
the Legation at Paris. It will
be seen thereby that my request
for a leave of absence to 
visit America preferred in 
my Despatch No. 21 and dated
February 18th met with an 
unqualified refusal and 
until I know the grounds



of that refusal I am at 
a loss in preferring another
request which in the not
distant future may be 
absolutely necessary for me.
If it was thought that 
I asked for a visit too
protracted, I have only
to urge Universal Custom,
the extreme precautions taken 
by naval vessels while
navigating <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_unclear tei_unclear">[?]</span> in the good
season on this coast, and 
above all the melancholy
fate of my colleague Mr
Armand, whose death was 
caused solely by blood poisoning 
from malaria. Though habituated
to extreme Southern Latitudes for
the last twenty-five years I 
am suffering some from the 
same cause. I have not been 
six months away from Africa
in eight years, and with 
this fact in view it can

<span class="hr"> </span>

hardly be esteemed
unreasonable by the Department
that I should be held too
closely by a Consulate
which scarcely pays for 
the writing it entails.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Regarding a Successor
for Mr Armand I know
of no person in Goree
who would exactly answer.
The nearest approach to it 
would be Charles de Montfort Esq 
the present Mayor of Goree
who understands the English
language sufficiently will
and is faultless as to business
qualifications and Character
but holding many colonial 
offices he is compelled to
be much of the time absent.
The only other suitable 
person that I know of is 
my son George Strickland
such is now on a visit 
home to bring out my family



and I expect him here 
early in September. It 
is not perhaps delicate 
for a father to recommend
his own son, and I shall
not do so only to state
facts which under the 
circumstances may be
acted on or not as the
Department shall think 
proper. He is 21 years of 
age, was born in New
London, Connecticut, has 
been liberally educated both
classically &amp; commercially,
writes an elegant hand 
and can both speak and 
write the French language 
with facility. He was 
with me here all of last
season and has altogether 
lived as many as three
years in Africa. He has
also been in France &amp;
England and several voyages

<span class="hr"> </span>

with me at sea, mostly
however when he was very 
young. As to political 
opinions neither of us have
ever expressed any by means
of a rate; not from apathy
perhaps but principally 
from lack of occasion.
My father however was
a life-long Democrat, and I 
have always been conscious 
of some bias that way:
not enough however to make 
me follow that or any party
in measures which our being
fairly examined my judgment
or conscience would condemn.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">My position with regard
to the Consulate is this:
as it came without seeking 
on my part so, I am prepared
to part with it as lightly
if it shall so seem expedient
for the Government. If however
it is still intrusted to me


    
I shall continue to render
the best service which my 
ability with some due
preparation to the means
will allow. For me to 
make occasional business
visits about the Coast is 
imperative, and it is also 
necessary that I should
sometimes go home. It is
easy however to arrange
so that the Consulate 
will not be neglected,
and with an apology
for these extended remarks</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir with respect<br/>
Very truly Yours<br/>
Peter Strickland
U.S. Consul</p>
