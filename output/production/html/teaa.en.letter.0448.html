      <p class="tei_p">Translation</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I, the undersigned, Chief of
Board of Health of the province
of Angola, do hereby certify that
L de Rathier du Verge Esqr, Consul
of the United States of America at
Loanda, has, since his arrival at
this city, suffered from endemic 
diseases:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The miasmatic poison has manifested 
itself through the intermittent 
fevers in their various forms,
together with inflamation of the
intestines and the biliary ducts,
congestion of the liver and spleen,
bilious fevers and slight dysentaries.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The medicinal treatment not
having obtained a complete cure,
I advised a voyage to the south 
of the province; but the result
was not very satisfactory.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For this reason, and seeing that
the patient's health is visibly declining, 
from day to day, I am 
of opinion that he should, at once, return



return to America, at the risk of
his life should he remain longer
under the influence of this climate.
The above is my opinion which I will
confirm under oath, if necessary.
Given at the Board of Health of 
the province of Angola at Loanda
on the 12th day of May 1883.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">(Signed) Antonio Duarte Ramada
Curto Chief of the Board of
Health.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">(L.S.)</p>
