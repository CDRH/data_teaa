      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to draw the attention of
the Department to my despatch dated May 
13th 1884 to which I have as yet received no 
answer.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have again a request from the
merchant at Mossamedes Mr Manoel José
Alves Bastos, owner of the Cahique that brought
the shipwrecked crew of the vessel "Merlin"
from Mossamedes to this port in 1883 for
payment of the freight viz: 300$000 equal
to $326 00/100 and I beg to request that the
Government will authorize me to pay him
at once as Mr Bastos has been always
exceedingly kind and of great service to all
American Sailors that have come to his port.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Unless

<span class="hr"> </span> 

Unless this is attended to at once I am
afraid that any future American sailors that
may arrive at Mossamedes in distress, will
have great difficulty in obtaining assistance</p>

Your most obedient Servant<br/>
