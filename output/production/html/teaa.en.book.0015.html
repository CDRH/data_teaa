         <p class="tei_p">In the annual message of Governor Adams, of South Carolina, for the year 1856, he proceeded to argue in favor of the reopening of the slave trade as follows:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"It is apprehended that the opening of this trade will lessen the value of slaves, and ultimately destroy the institution. It is a sufficient answer to point to the fact that unrestricted immigration has not diminished the value of labor in the northwestern confederacy. The cry there is the want of labor, notwithstanding capital has the pauperism of the old world to press into the grinding service. If we cannot supply the demand for slave labor, then we must expect to be supplied with a species of labor we do not want, and which is, from the very nature of things, antagonistic to our institutions. It is much better that our drays should be driven by slaves, that our factories should be worked by slaves, that our hotels should be served by slaves, that our locomotives should be manned by slaves, than that we should be exposed to the introduction from any quarter of a population alien to us by birth, training, and education, and which in the process of time must lead to that conflict between capital and labor 'which makes it so difficult to maintain free institutions in all wealthy and highly civilized nations where such institutions as ours do not exist.' In all slaveholding states true policy dictates that the superior race should direct, and the inferior perform all menial service. Competition between the white and black man for this service may not disturb norther sensibility, but it does not exactly suit our latitude.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Irrespective, however, of interest, the act of Congress declaring the slave trade piracy is a brand upon us which I think it important to remove. If the trade be piracy, the slave must be plunder, and no ingenuity can avoid the logical necessity of such a conclusion. My hopes and fortunes are indissolubly associated with this form of society. I feel that I would be wanting in duty if I did not urge you to withdraw your assent to an act which is itself a direct condemnation of your institutions. But we have interests to enforce a course of self-respect. I believe, as I have already stated, that more slaves are necessary to a continuance of our monopoly in plantation products. I believe that they are necessary to the full development of our whole round of agricultural and mechanical resources; that they are necessary to the restoration of the South to an equality of power in the general government, perhaps to the very integrity of the slave society, disturbed as it has been by causes which have induced an undue proportion of the ruling race. To us have been committed the fortunes of this peculiar form of society resulting from the union of unequal races. It has vindicated its claim to the approbation of an enlightened humanity; it has civilized and christianized the African; it has exalted the white race itself to higher hopes and purposes, and it is perhaps of the most sacred obligation that we should give it the means of expansion, and that we should press it forward to a perpetuity of progress."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In the House of Representatives of the United States, Monday, Dec. 15, 1856, Mr. Etheridge (Fillmore American), of Tenn., asked leave to introduce the following resolution:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Resolved, That this House of Representatives regard all suggestions and propositions of every kind, by whomsoever made, for a revival of the African slave trade, as shocking to the moral sentiment of the enlightened portion of mankind; and that any action on the part of Congress conniving at or legalizing that horrid and inhuman traffic, would justly subject the Government and citizens of the United States to the reproach and execration of all civilized and Christian people throughout the world."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Smith (Democrat), of Va., objected. Mr Etheridge moved a suspension of the rules, which was carried—yeas 140, nays 53.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">During the pendency of these proceedings, the following remarks were made by members:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Walker. I do not design to enter into debate, but only to ask the gentleman from Tennessee whether, if there is a suspension of the rules, and this resolution is received, it is his purpose to call the previous question with a view of cutting off debate upon the adoption of the resolution?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Etheridge. I will answer the gentleman. The resolution, to my mind, contains a self-evident proposition. I presume there is no gentleman here who has not an opinion upon the question, and I do not wish to discuss it. I shall move the previous question if I shall succeed in getting the floor.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Jones of Tenn. I would ask my colleague if he cannot modify his resolution so as to leave out all his reasons, his argument, and his speech? I say to my colleague that I am [loud cries of "Order!" "Order!"] as much opposed to opening the African slave trade as he is or any other man. [Cries of "Order!" "Order!"]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. Debate is not in order.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Jones of Tenn. I do not intend to debate the matter, but I am not to be put down by my colleague.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The yeas and nays were ordered.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. I give notice that, if the rules are suspended, I will offer the following resolution as a substitute for that proposed by the gentleman from Tennessee:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Resolved, That it is inexpedient to repeal the laws prohibiting the African slave trade."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Puryear. Before I vote upon this question, I desire to ask the indulgence of the House to state that I am as much opposed to the revival of the slave trade as any gentleman upon this floor; but I believe that this resolution

<span class="hr"> </span>

is introduced out of place, and that this is not the time for it. I shall therefore vote against it. If the time shall ever arrive when my vote can affect the question, I shall vote against the revival of the slave trade.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Smith of Va. In explanation of the vote which I shall give, I will say that I deem the revival of the slave trade as inexpedient; but I think I understand the object in introducing this resolution, and non concurring in that object, I shall vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Zollicoffer. I desire to say that I am decidedly opposed to the reopening of the slave trade; but as I do not perceive that any good can grow out of introducing that question here, I shall vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Phelps. I am opposed to re-establishing the slave trade, and should vote against a bill which proposes to repeal the laws now prohibiting it. But I am against abstractions; and as the message of Governor Adams of South Carolina is not before us, I record my vote in the negative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Burnett. I am as much opposed to reopening the slave trade as any man upon this floor; but believing I fully understand the object of the gentleman who introduced the resolution, and that I can understand the inducements which have led him to present it at this time, I shall vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Washburne of Me. I shall object to any explanations hereafter.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Jewett. I would inquire of the Chair whether, if the rules are suspended, the first question will be upon the amendment of the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Orr], and then upon the resolution offered by the gentleman from Tennessee?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. The amendment of the gentleman from South Carolina has not been received. If the rules are suspended, the question will be first upon the resolution offered by the gentleman from Tennessee.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Jewett. I vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Barksdale. I am not in favor of reopening the African slave trade.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Washburne of Me. I object to debate.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Barksdale. I do not believe that any gentleman upon this side of the House is. ["Order!" "Order!"] But I regard the resolution of the gentleman from Tennessee as ill-timed [renewed cries of "Order!"], out of place, thrown into the House as a firebrand [loud cries of "Order!" "Order!" and great confusion], and for the accomplishment of a party purpose. I therefore vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Keitt. I wish to say that if I had been in the House—[cries of "Order!" "Order!"]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. The gentleman from South Carolina desires to state the manner in which he should have voted, had he been within the Hall when his name was called. That courtesy has never been refused to any member, and if the gentleman confines himself to that point, the Chair thinks he is in order.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Keitt. I wish to say that had I been here when my name was called, I should have voted "no;" among other reasons—[loud cries of "Order!"]—because I consider the resolution as improper and irrelevant. What my views are upon the whole subject, I will express, when I can do so fully.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Garnett stated that had he been within the Hall, when his name was called, he should have voted "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Kelly stated that he should have voted "no," had he been in the House when his name was called.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Greenwood (Dem.) of Ark. So far as I am advised, there is no gentleman on this side of the House who is in favor of reopening the African slave trade; but I shall vote against the suspension of the rules.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. I ask the gentleman from Tennessee to let my resolution be introduced as an amendment to the one he has offered, so that the House may have the choice between them.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Now, Mr. Speaker, I think with the gentleman himself, that it is inexpedient to open the slave trade; and, if he will consent to let my amendment be offered, I am confident there will be an almost unanimous vote of the House against the re-opening of that trade.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Etheridge. If it were impossible for the gentleman to get in his resolution as I got mine, I would withdraw the call for the previous question, and let his resolution come in; but it is just as easy for him as it was for me to present his resolution, and, if objected to, to move a suspension of the rules for its introduction. [Cries of "Order!"]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Jones of Tenn. I wish to ask my colleague a question. Will he answer me?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Etheridge. I will.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Jones. Does my colleague desire to have a fair expression of this House against the reopening of the slave trade; or does he wish such an expression as will be offensive to his own friends and his own section of the country?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Barclay (Rep.) of Pa. I object to debate.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. McMullen (Democrat) of Va. stated that he was opposed to reopening the slave trade; but could not vote for the resolution because of the terms in which it was couched.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Millson. I ask to be excused from voting on the adoption of the resolution. If this were a measure of legislation, I would vote on the one side or the other. I am ready to vote for a resolution condemnatory of the slave trade on grounds of expediency, humanity, and morality. [Cries of "Order!"] I will not be half a minute. I wish to state the reasons for my request. The rule says:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Every member who shall be in the House when the question is put shall give his vote, unless the House, for special reason, shall excuse him."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. The previous question is ordered, and the gentleman cannot debate the question.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Millson. I do not ask to debate it; I merely wish to give "the special reason" for

<span class="hr"> </span>

my request to be excused from voting on the adoption of the resolution. A vote for or against the resolution will place me in a false position. There are parts and bearings of the resolution to which I have objection, and I cannot consistently vote for it; while I am in favor of the general objects of the resolution, and am therefore unwilling to vote against it. For these reasons, like some of my colleagues, I desire to be excused from voting at all, as neither an affirmative nor a negative vote will represent me correctly.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Eustis. Inasmuch as my friend from Tennessee [Mr. Etheridge] has seen fit to impose the gag-rule upon us, and as I desire to vote understandingly, I want to know from the chair whether I can have my reasons for giving the vote which I intend to give spread upon the record? I vote against the resolution, not that I am in favor of the revival of the slave trade, for I believe there is but one opinion upon this subject. I vote against it, because I look upon the resolution as uncalled for, as unwarranted, and "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." [Cries of "Order!" "Order!"]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Grow. I object.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. Debate is out of order.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Florence. Mr. Speaker, there is not quite enough cheese on this "figure 4" to catch me. The attractive trap is not quite well enough baited, as beautifully gilded as it is, to be deceived by it. The real purpose to my mind is too apparent. I am quite as decidedly and as strongly opposed to reopening the African slave trade as any one in this broad land, believing it to be contrary to the spirit of the age, and repulsive to the most acute and sensitive feelings of philanthropy and enlarged humanity; but as I cannot see that any practical good is to result from an introduction of the subject here, or why the valuable time of this short session of Congress should be taken up either with the discussion or agitation of it, in the form and manner in which the resolution offered by the gentleman from Tennessee presents it, I vote in the negative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Harris of Ill. Is it in order to explain the vote I give?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. It is not.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Harris of Ill. I will vote, then, and I vote for all that part of the resolution which denounces the slave trade. [Cries of "Order!" "Order!"]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. McMullen. I ask to be excused from voting upon this unnecessary and nonsensical resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Sage. I move the gentleman be excused.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The motion was agreed to.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Oliver of Mo. I am decidedly opposed to the revival of the African slave trade—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. Debate is not in order.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Oliver of Mo. But upon this resolution I vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. If I can get the floor, I shall give my opinions hereafter in the shape of a resolution. I vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Savage. Mr. Speaker, I am very much opposed to voting on such a resolution as this, and before doing so address an inquiry to the Chair. I inquire of the Chair whether all declarations, resolutions, innuendoes, suggestions, and propositions, by whomsoever made, suggesting or intending that the present Congress will connive at or legalize the slave trade, are not dishonest, fraudulent, and false, and made for political effect?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. The gentleman is not in order.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Savage. I vote "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Smith of Tenn. I am opposed to the renewal of the slave trade, but upon this resolution I vote "no," because I believe the purpose of it is wrong.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Smith of Va. stated that he was against the revival of the slave trade, and against the resolution, and therefore voted "no."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Sneed. On this stump speech I vote "no." [Laughter.]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Wright of Tenn. I am opposed to the policy of reopening the slave trade. The people whom I represent, and I believe I can say that nearly the whole of the people of Tennessee, are opposed to that policy. But whilst I am utterly opposed to that policy, I am also opposed to the resolution offered by my colleague, because, sir, I believe it has effected precisely the object which he intended it to have; that was, sir, to open afresh and again a question which I hope will soon be banished from this hall; and to divide and distract a party to which he is bitterly opposed was another object of the resolution. This latter object he cannot effect, however much he may have desired it. Sir, I vote "no." [Cries of "Order!" frequently interrupted the remarks.]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Zollicoffer. I would have preferred to have an opportunity to change the phraseology of the resolution; but as no alternative is given to me but to vote for it or against it, to avoid misconstruction of my sentiments I will vote "ay."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Cadwalader. I ask the unanimous consent of the House to enter my protest against that part of the resolution which might, if unexplained, imply and assumption on the part of this House of a right to censure a recent public act of the chief magistrate of one of the states of the Union. I vote for the resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. C. took his seat amid loud calls to order by the Speaker and by the House.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. McMullen. Some of my friends thought I desired to dodge this question by asking to be excused from voting.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. For what purpose does the gentleman rise?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. McMullen. I rise for the purpose of voting, and I vote "no," against this demagogical resolution.</p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">The resolution was then adopted, yeas 152, nays 57. The ayes and noes on this resolution will be found in a tabular statement with that on Mr. Orr's resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. I ask the unanimous consent of the House to offer the following resolution:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Resolved, That it is inexpedient, unwise, and contrary to the settled policy of the United States, to repeal the laws prohibiting the African slave trade.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Barclay (Republican) of Penn. objected.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The rules were suspended, yeas 181, nays 10.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The negative vote was as follows:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Nays.—Messrs. Barclay, Barksdale, Hendley S. Bennett, Brooks, Crawford, Day, Garnett, Quitman, Shorter, Walker.—10.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Quitman. There are two words I should like to see stricken out of that resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. That can be done only by unanimous consent.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. It is due to the gentleman from Mississippi to state, that if the rules be suspended I shall call for the previous question on the passage of the resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Quitman. I vote no, then, as the gentleman from South Carolina is determined to call for the previous question.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Keitt. I vote ay, on the suspension of the rules, out of compliment to my colleague: but on the passage of the resolution I shall vote no.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Florence. Inasmuch as this matter has been lugged in, not by this but by the other side of the House, I vote to suspend the rules, with a view to the introduction of the resolution of the gentleman from South Carolina.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Caruthers said that if he had been within the bar when his name was called, he would have voted in the affirmative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Brooks. It is not in order to give the reasons or my vote?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Speaker. It is not.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Brooks. I vote in the negative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The question now being on the adoption of the resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr called for the previous question.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Boyce. I have a substitute for my colleague's resolution, which I ask may be read for the information of the House. The resolution was read, as follows—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Resolved, That the House of Representatives, expressing, as they believe, public opinion both North and South, are utterly opposed to the reopening of the slave trade."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Quitman. I ask my friend from South Carolina to withdraw his call from the previous question, to enable me to offer and amendment to his resolution. I agree to the resolution, if the words, "contrary to the settled policy of the United States," be stricken out. I deem it improper to pronounce judgment on that point in advance of discussion.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. I think the resolution is in the best shape as it is. If it does not meet with gentlemen's approbation, they can frame other resolutions which will suit them, and present them to the House. I decline to withdraw the call for the previous question.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Washburne of Me. I ask the gentleman from South Carolina to withdraw the call for the previous question long enough for me to offer an amendment to his resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. I ask the House to vote on the resolution as it is. I therefore respectfully decline to withdraw the call for the previous question.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The resolution was then adopted, yeas 183, nays 8. The yeas and nays will be found in the tabular statement on the following page, as also those on Mr. Etheridge's resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Barksdale stated that he could not vote for the resolution, regarding it too broad in its terms. He would have voted for that proposed by the gentleman's colleague [Mr. Boyce].</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Shorter. Mr. Speaker, the South has not applied to Congress to repeal the law prohibiting the foreign slave trade, and until she does so, I am opposed to any agitation of the question here. It may be unwise and inexpedient to repeal existing laws on this subject, but I am not prepared to say what will, or will not, be the "settled policy" of the South in time to come. Without intending to say that I am in favor of reopening the slave trade, I vote against the resolution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Watkins. I have declined voting on the several resolutions relative to reopening the slave trade, because I have paired off with M. Watson. If I had been at liberty to vote, I should have voted in accordance with my views of the nationality of the subject. [Laughter.]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Puryear stated that if he had been present when his name was called, he would have voted in the affirmative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Paine stated that if he had been within the bar when his name was called, he would have voted in the affirmative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Recapitulation of the votes. 109 Republicans, 24 Fillmore Americans, and 18 Democrats, voted for Mr. Etheridge's resolution, and 50 Democrats and 7 Fillmore Americans against it.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">102 Republicans, 23 Fillmore Americans, and 58 Democrats, voted for Mr. Orr's resolution, and 8 Democrats against it.</p>

         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">The Hon. John A. Quitman, of Mississippi, in alluding to the reasons which induced his vote against the resolutions of Messrs. Orr and Etheridge, thus spoke on the 15th of Dec., 1856, in House:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I voted against both resolutions; and now take this first opportunity of stating the reasons of those votes. Both resolutions were, in my opinion, as objectionable in substance, as the mode of forcing a vote on them, under the pressure of the previous question, was improper. The prominent features in the proposition of the member from Tennessee are its sinister expressions, and the intensely virtuous indignation manifested, not against the revival of the African slave trade, but against the wickedness of those who would have the hardihood to make suggestions or propositions in relation thereto; and, as if the deter all good patriots from even harboring such suggestions, it invokes the reproach and execration of "the civilized and Christian people throughout the world" upon the government and people of the United States should Congress, by any action, connive at or listen to such suggestions. It denounces thoughts, propositions, and opinions, on the assumption that they are shocking to the moral sentiment of mankind. Now, sir, I find in the written chart of the duties and powers of this House no authority to take charge of the public or private morals of the good people of the country. It is a vain and pharisaical arrogance of superior virtue in us to assume such censorship. I intend no personal disrespect when I say that this House, constituted as it is, is one of the last tribunals to which questions of public morals or of private honor should be referred; and yet, sir, the resolution of the gentleman from Tennessee, if it spray from any higher motive than that of entrapping political opponents, was a mere attempt to denounce as immoral and unchristian certain opinions known to be entertained by some of our fellow-citizens, and to invoke, in advance of any proposed action, horrid imprecations on the country should Congress in any way connive at such sentiments, by any political action. I surely do the gentleman no injustice when I say, that his object was not merely to obtain an expression of the opinion of this House against the African slave trade. he will hardly venture to say that that alone was his object. It went obviously further. The studied phraseology in which the resolution is clothed, going to the very verge of parliamentary license, indicates the purpose of obtaining the influence of this House to put down and stifle opinions and propositions on subjects of legitimate inquiry, on the grounds that they are infamous and detestable. It is a precedent full of mischief and danger, which I regret especially to see introduced by a Southern man. Under it, what is to prevent the introduction of a resolution declaring the holding of slaves to be immoral, inhuman, and contrary to the spirit of Christianity? There are probably some on this floor ready to present such a proposition, and, from the complexion of this House, I am not certain it would not pass, if propelled by the brute force of the previous question. I repeat, the precedent is dangerous, and, in my opinion, more pregnant of evil, than the "suggestions" so much condemned by the mover. I regret that it should have received the sanction of a single Democrat on this floor. Were we sitting as a board of censors upon the morality of practices affecting human happiness in general, I would desire to include in our censures the cooley trade, now practised by our refined and virtuous ally, England; for, by that trade, white men, if I may so designate the Chinese, are carried into the worst kind of slavery. I would wish also to embrace in our deprecations, the "shocking and unchristian" practice of immuring in the unhealthy and fetid prison rooms of a factory for eleven hours of the day, white children of both sexes, and of tender age, thereby destroying the health and elasticity of their bodies, and blunting and stupefying their intellects, by the constant employment of watching the interminable whirling of the spinning-jenny. I protest, Mr. Speaker, against this House establishing any code of morals for the country; but if we are to have one, let it be general.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I was not at all surprised to see the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Etheridge] refusing to suspend the previous question, at the request of my friend from South Carolina [Mr. Orr], to enable the latter gentleman to offer an amendment, which would have brought the House to a direct vote, on the expediency of reviving the African slave trade; but I <em class="hi">was</em> surprised, in the sequel, to find the gentleman from South Carolina refusing a similar privilege to me. After the passage of the obnoxious resolution of the gentleman from Tennessee, my friend from South Carolina, with a view, no doubt, to put himself and friends right upon the journals, introduced a resolution differing from that he had originally proposed as a substitute. The first proposition would have been acceptable to all of us; the difference consisted in the addition of the words "and contrary to the settled policy of the United States." The previous question having been called on this resolution, I appealed to the mover to permit an amendment, striking out the words "contrary to the settled policy of the United States," in order that I, and those acting with me, might unite upon his resolution; but the gentleman refused to do for a political friend, that which he complained had not been accorded to him by a political opponent. This want of courtesy compels me to make some explanation.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Orr. I did not complain of the refusal of the gentleman from Tennessee to let me offer an amendment to his resolution; I merely requested that he would afford me an opportunity so to do.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Quitman [addressing Mr. Orr]. Well,

<span class="hr"> </span>

I recall the word "complain;" but, in making a request of a political opponent, you implied that it should have been granted. Now, Mr. Speaker, my position on this subject is simply this: I am not in favor of the revival of the African slave trade. Not because I look upon it as "shocking, horrid, or deserving the execration of the civilized world;" for I believe it has resulted in practical benefit to the negro; not that I believe that transfer of a slave from benighted Africa to America—from the dominion of a cruel and despotic negro master, to a kind and humane white master, does any harm to him, or to the world; but I am opposed to the revival of the African slave trade because, in my judgment, it is inexpedient, impolitic, and adverse to the interests of the section of country which I represent. Such, too, I believe to be the prevailing sentiment at the South. I should have voted, and am ready to vote, for any proposition which shall confine itself to a declaration against the policy or expediency of the African slave-trade; but I will not, by any fear of consequences or misconstruction, be driven to adopt the affectedly denunciatory language of the gentleman from Tennessee. It is the language either of cowardice or of hypocrisy; not that of plain dealing. I speak of the resolution, not of the gentleman. I should not be much surprised to find it followed by a resolution condemning the internal slave trade. I say again, distinctly, that, had these resolutions simply declared that the revival of the African slave trade was inexpedient, and even against public policy, my voice would have been heard strongly in the affirmative; but I am opposed to lectures upon the morality of that trade. There I stand; and I cannot be coaxed or dragooned into the support of resolutions, which I do not believe to be true.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The resolution of the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Orr] was also objectionable, though not in the same degree. It proclaimed "the settled policy of the country" to be against a repeal of the present laws. Now, in the first place, in a progressive country like ours, where public sentiment sways the public policy, there is an impropriety in any Congress resolving what shall be the future or settled policy of the country. Every Congress will have enough to do to adapt its action and legislation to its own proper term of authority and power. I regard such language, to say the least of it, as empty declamation.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In the next place, it being admitted that treaties are laws, this language of the resolution goes to the extent of approving and perpetuating all our treaty stipulations in relation to the African slave trade; and of some of these I do not approve, but, on the contrary, believe them to be unwise and impolitic. Such, for instance, is the stipulation to aid Great Britain in watching, with a naval force, the coast of Africa. Neither am I prepared to say, though opposed to the slave trade, that it ought to be treated as piracy. I doubt much whether the horrors of the middle passage do not arise, mainly, from the false philanthropy of exaggerated punishments. Resting in this uncertainty, I could not, by my vote, declare the laws and treaties on this subject to be our "settled policy." For these reasons, now given, because explanation was refused when the resolutions were offered, and because I regarded both resolutions as useless and unnecessary, I opposed them.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Hon. John V. Wright of Tenn., in alluding to the reasons which induced his vote against Mr. Etheridge's resolution, thus spoke in the House, on the 4th of Feb. 1857:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Mr. Chairman, one word more, and I will close. When my colleague from the Trenton district [Mr. Etheridge], a few days ago, offered a resolution with regard to the reopening the African slave trade, I voted against it, because, sir, as I then stated, I thought it was offered for the purpose of dividing and distracting, if possible, the Democratic party. Knowing my colleague's deep-rooted hatred to that party to which I am attached, and believing that it is the only party to which the destinies of the country can safely be intrusted, I was unwilling to give my countenance to a scheme which I then thought was set on foot to embarrass its action. I also think, with the distinguished gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. Quitman], whom I am proud to call my friend, that Congress is a very unsafe tribunal to decide for the people of the United States what shall or shall not be their standard of morality. But, sir, while I voted against that resolution, as I then stated, I am opposed to the policy of reopening the African slave trade. I voted very cheerfully for the resolution of the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Orr,] which declared it to be 'unwise, inexpedient, and against the settlement policy of the government' to reopen that trade. I regretted exceedingly that my colleague [Mr. Etheridge] should have raised that question at a time when he well knew that the whole of the people of Tennessee, with scarcely an exception, are opposed to the policy alluded to. I do not believe there is a single member here from the South (with perhaps one exception) who does favor that policy; and yet a settled attempt is being made to impress upon the public mind of the North that the South desires the reopening of that trade. But, whatever the motive of my colleague may have been, it is passed; and if he intended what I have said, I am very happy that he disappointed in his hopes."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Hon. Emerson Etheridge of Tenn., on the 21st of Feb., 1857, thus gave his reasons for opposing the resolution:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"In the Democratic party were to be found those who openly advocated a revival of the African slave trade, or denounced the laws and treaties by which it is prohibited. Every day they were growing bolder, and increasing

<span class="hr"> </span>

their numbers. They could have been found here—here, we are told, on this floor. The late Presidential election, which so many fondly hoped would break up the government, was over. Kansas, which, under Mr. Buchanan's administration, we are assured by his political friends will soon be a free state, could not much longer furnish northern or southern disunionists with political capital. A proposition to reopen the African slave trade would be the best thing—the very best, because it is impossible—to stir up anew the excited millions of the North. It would furnish them a pretext to stigmatize their southern brethren as a race of cannibals. Worcester would again be filled with an assemblage of disunionists seeking the overthrow of the Union, to destroy slavery in the states, while Nashville might be the rendezvous of a counter convocation, urging the same means to preserve and perpetuate it.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Sir, I have said that this proposition to reopen the slave trade had its supporters and apologists in the South. Not only so, they are in many instances men of great abilities and of high position. I admit the whole scheme to be impossible without a previous separation of the states, and that it is impossible in the Union gives significance to the fact that the scheme has its friends, advocates, and apologists. Sir, I have before me now a copy of the New Orleans Delta, published late in December last. It is a paper conducted with great power and ability. It is radically Democratic, supported Buchanan and Breckenridge, and is the organ of a powerful division of the Democratic party South. It says:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"The Crescent thinks the coup de grace was administered to the slave trade question by the late vote in the House. It is a mistake; the question will grow in importance from this time forth. Quitman, Percy, Walker, Bennett, Wright, Shorter, Brooks, Keitt, and Barksdale, are men whose names will be honored hereafter for the unflinching manner in which they stood up for principle, for truth, and consistency, as well as the vital interests of the South, in the late vote in the House by which politicians sought to strangle an infant Hercules whose manhood they dreaded."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Yes, sir, such was my purpose. If this thing is to be continuously urged, if it is to be regarded as an open question, it may assume gigantic proportions. I would strangle it in its infancy. I hope never to behold such a monstrosity as its full development would present. The same paper, in an article upon "the slave trade," says:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Let it no longer be stigmatized as piracy to maintain slavery by the same means which originated it. Let that opprobrious brand be taken from the brow of the South. Let the sentimental humbuggery of Albert Pike and such like be scouted into ridicule, and let rationalism and true philanthropy be respected."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">A correspondent of that paper, writing from this city, the 18th of December last, says:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"The question of reopening the trade will be postponed until the next Congress, when a formal proposition will be introduced concerning it, and the question fully rifled."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The proceedings of the late Southern Convention, which assembled at Savannah, were full of meaning in this respect. For years it had been roving about the country to find some plan for building ships without money, and to monopolize the carrying trade without ships. Aspiring young men found within it opportunities for display, and broken-down politicians a chance for resurrection. A seven years' effort to instruct us in the means of growing rich without labor, and building up cities behind mud-banks and sand-bars, and proved unavailing. Something else must be done. The suffering South, with all its means invested in agriculture, must do something to set off its commercial inequality. The "nigger pill," which is prescribed for almost every conceivable complaint, must be administered in larger doses. Hence the proposition to reopen the African slave trade—a measure which was favored by about one-third of the convention. Why, sir, this project had so grown in favor, and was exciting so much sympathy in high quarters, that we find the present Democratic governor of Georgia made it the subject of remark in his late message to the legislature of that state. He declared the proposition as "adverse to the sentiments of the civilized world, to our treaty stipulations for its suppression, and the conventional laws of nations, by which it is declared to be piracy." Yet, while I, for what I have done, have been held up as untrue to the South, good, Democratic Governor Johnson is merely chided as an "erring brother," and pressed by his political friends for a cabinet appointment. I think, however, he will have to stand aside to make room for another gentleman from that state, who thinks that to revive that traffic would not be "shocking to the moral sentiments of the enlightened portion of mankind." So plain and obvious has this movement been, that Mr. Nicholson, the editor of the Union, published in this city, has had to lend his columns to its denunciation. But recently he stigmatized it as an "odious traffic," and was permitted to go without a public reprimand for his temerity. It is true, he is soon to withdraw from the editorial chair of the court journal, and one Mr. Appleton is to be the organ-grinder of the party. The cause of this change I leave others to determine.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have now before me a pamphlet, recently published in Georgia, styled "A new Southern Policy, or the Slave Trade as meaning Union and Conservatism." I can commend it to young Democratic politicians as a very able and condensed view of the subject, which they will find of some value, should the stern demands of party require them to subscribe to this "new Southern policy." In speaking of the Savannah Convention, he says:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"There were introduced into the convention two leading measures, viz., the laying of a state tariff on northern goods, and the reopening of the slave-trade; the one to advance our commercial interest, the other our agricultural interest, and which, when taken together, as they were doubtless intended to be, and although they have each been attacked by presses of doubtful service to the South, are characterized in the private judgment of politicians as one of the completest southern remedies ever submitted to popular action."</p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Now, sir, between this author and myself there is, in the language of a good Baptist brother on a memorable occasion, "a slight variation." [Great laughter.] In my judgment, the two propositions, when taken together, constitute a plan the enforcement of which would involve at once the commercial and agricultural ruin of the South. The writer then addresses himself to those who are a little squeamish upon the subject, who, like some of our newspaper correspondents, have troublesome "moral convictions." He says:—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"The proposition to revive, or more properly to reopen, the slave trade, is as yet but imperfectly understood, in its intentions and probable results, by the people of the South, and but little appreciated by them. It has been received in all parts of the country with an undefined sort of repugnance, a sort of squeamishness, which is incident to all such violations of moral prejudices, and invariably wears off on familiarity with the subject. The South will commence by enduring, and end by embracing the project."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">This forcibly reminds me of some lines we all have read:—</p>
         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">"Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">As to be hated, needs but to be seen;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">We first endure, then pity, then embrace."</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">But as the author applied them to individuals, I shall demur to a prosaic application to whole communities: "The South will commence by enduring, and end by embracing the project!" I hope not. It is true I have witnessed some striking evidences of Democratic party endurance, but I trust when public attention is called to this project, the people will forbid the banns—repudiate an embrace which must end in dishonor and death.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Sir, I cannot take time to refer to the many proofs I might offer to sustain what I have asserted. The evidence exists, and may be read of all men. Not the least significant thing is the fact that, where one Democratic editor or politician at the South has denounced those who have advocated reopening the African slave trade, scores may be found who were horrified at a proposition designed to brand the scheme as it deserved. I shall ever regret that the torrent of pious indignation I have encountered was not hurled at those who, in my judgment, produced a necessity for the rebuke which the resolution was intended to convey. As to the language of the resolution, I can only say that I have no apologies to make. Could I, without violence to parliamentary courtesy, have found more severe language, I should have used it. Our laws are treaties now denounce it as piracy. As I shall ever sustain those laws and treaties, I shall affect no mock sympathy for those persons who would transform existing piracy into laudable commerce. If the trade were legalized to-morrow, I would first have to consider myself an outlaw from the society of good men everywhere, before I would, for any reason, engage in it, and I think it would be no cause for national sorrow if every ship thus manned and thus destined were to go down to the bottom of the sea.</p>
