      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your No. 8,
of Oct. 6, 1898, which was
received Nov. 15, 1898, assuring
me that the question of
the retention of the Consular
Agency, at "Cape Coast Castle,"
would be held in abeyance,
until I shall have had
opportunity to make a careful
investigation, in order, to show
the necessity, for a further
continuation of said Agency &amp;c.
In reply, I beg to say, that
in my No. 2, "Consular," of
Aug., 29, 1898, I endeavored
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to show, that for the want of
a correspondent, at Cape Coast,
I was unable to give the
desired information; but from
prospective causes, expressed
a hopeful future for said
Agency.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In my No. 28,
"Diplomatic," which should
have been "Consular," of
Sept., 22, 1898, I suggested
the propriety of visiting said
Agency, in person, during
the stay of a United States'
Cruiser, in these waters,
provided the Department
thought my suggestion to
send one here, during the
month of December, next
well founded.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am very
reliably informed, that
Cape Coast, is  11 days'
distance or over 2000
miles from Monrovia
thus

<span class="hr"> </span>

thus entailing an expense
of $75.00 or $100.00. But in
case the Department think
it not wise to send a
Cruiser to these waters,
with the instructions to
take me to Cape Coast,
I will visit the said
Agency, early in 1899,
and will report according
to my personal observations.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to be your obedient
servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith</p>
