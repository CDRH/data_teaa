      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit
to you the intelligence,
that food and water supplies
are very scarce; and
high proportionately! The
scarcity of food may be accounted
for, first; owing to the decline
in the price of coffee; the staple
and principal production of
the Liberian farmer. The decline,
in the price of coffee, has
almost paralysed the prosperity
of the Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Secondly; the unsettled state of
affairs, between the interior
tribes and the Liberian Government,
has

<span class="hr"> </span>

has brought about a state of
non-commercial intercourse,
between the former and the latter.
Thirdly; the prevalence of small pox,
among the native fishermen,
has brought about a voluntary
temporary <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">quaranty[?]</span> between
the native fish markets and
the Liberian.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">If a beef is to be butchered,
the owner of it; propositions it
out to his near relatives
and friends, before it is killed.
The salesman is guided by
a list in parcelling out the
beef, and a stranger with
money in hand and the
most urgent plea cannot
purchase it!</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Having no reservoir nor
artificial water supplies;
the few who have wells on
their lots, are charging as
high as 1 cent per gallon or
two dollars per month for
water

water! The tension, may in
part, be broken, in about 6
weeks, as we usually have
showers, in the latter part of
April.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
be your obedient servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
Consul General.</p>
