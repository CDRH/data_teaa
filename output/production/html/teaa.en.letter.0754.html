May 30th 1886</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/> 
James D Porter<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/> 
Washington</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The latest advices from
the Bakel district are to 
the effect that the place
has been relieved, the blacks, 
having everywhere been 
defeated without chance
for their recovery. Several
Chiefs have been captured
and some of them, the 
instigators of the outbreak,
have been dealt with rigorously.
The French have now about 
3500 troops in Senegal but 
many of them will soon embark
for France. I am Sir, Very truly Yours<br/>
Peter Strickland<br/> 
US Consul</p>
