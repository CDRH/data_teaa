88 Beaver St.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform
you that the present state of my
health, coupled with private matters
requiring my personal attention in this
country, will not admit of my returning
to my post, and I have, therefore,
respectfully to offer my resignation as
Consul at Bathurst.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There being no American
citizen, now resident in Bathurst;
I would respectfully beg to suggest
the appointment of Mr. Richard Charles
Lloyd of this city</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Lloyd, though an Englishman by 
birth, he presents the only established
American house in Bathurst, and 
is in his interests, and connections
American.</p>
      <span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To The Honorable<br/> 
W. H. Seward<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">My confidence in recommending 
this appointment is increased,
by the fact, that I have reason to
believe, that it would give satisfaction 
to the Colonial authorities
who are always consulted, by 
the Foreign office, before an
Exequatur is granted.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have also, respectfully
to suggest to the Department, the 
establishing of a Consulate at
Freetown, Sierra Leone: it is
now, as you are aware, a 
Consular Agency, under the direction 
of the Bathurst Consul.
The importance of Freetown in
a commercial point of view,
and the lack of frequent communication 
between it and 
the Gambia render it, in
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

my opinion advisable.
No one better fitted for the position
of Consul can be found there
than Mr. Henry Rider of Salem
Massachusetts, the present Consular Agent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your most obdt. Servt.<br/>
Danl R. B. Upton</p>
