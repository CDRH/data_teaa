      <p class="tei_p">U S Consulate, Goree-Dakar<br/>
August 10th 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/>
William F Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Consular Report's which have
been afforded me during the past
six years have been largely made up
of statistics of the productions and of
the movements of trade in foreign countries,
with a paragraph often appended
telling what advantages would ensue
if we also had ships and commerce.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Undoubtedly,—and as I must
confess to some lameness in statistics
for lack of means to gather them, I
will now endeavor measurably to make amends
by exhibiting a subject I am better acquainted
with,—a subject perhaps which if not 
dealt with soon will afford no material
for statistics,ᾹI allude to a healthy
American Commerce and the primary needs
for upbuilding it.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">President Harrison in his inaugral
seemed to have a due appreciation of



the matter, and in selecting Secretaries
of State from the seaboard gave an
earnest that he means to signalise his
administration by doing what can be
done to restore to America her nearly last
foreign commerce.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Distinguished Americans have never
yet been wanting to show how this can
best be accomplished, and some of them
have hit quite fairly portions of the
mark. Others have advocated measures
which I should be very sorry to see
adopted, such as buying ships abroad etc.
I lay no claim to infallibility in what I 
am about to advance, but nevertheless
think the projectile will be found <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">suffice[?]</span>
for the mark on any bearing, and now
the time seems opportune to hit it.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Years ago when a young shipmaster
and therefore keenly interested in everything
which relates to vessels, noting the rapid
decline in the ship owning interest, which
in many ways affected me, and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">about[?]</span>
the wretched condition of seamen <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">with[?]</span>
whom I was constantly having dealings.
I, in moments of leisure at sea, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">wrote[?]</span> 
the enclosed Book entitled, "A voice from
the Deep", which bears on all the subjects



I have mentioned at the head
of this Dispatch. It has not however
hitherto been my intention to send
a copy of the Book to the Department, 
but to condense it into a report
which might be published: but present
lack of time and uncertainty as regards
the future seem to render sufficient
delay for this purpose unadvisable.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Many changes have occurred since
the Book was written, which perhaps render
parts of it of less consequence than formerly,
also if I were to write such a Book
now it might be more condensed and
methodical, but hardly I think more truthful
which after all is the main point.
The ideas suggested may perhaps be
thought radical by some, but they are
practical and thoroughly American, although
they might not be rated so by not a
few of the dignified members of sundry
Chambers of Commerce.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My object in sending the Book
is that it may accomplish some
of the good for which it was designed.
It can speak for itself if it finds
the right listeners, and hoping that
it may succeed in this I commit



it to the care and courtesy of the
Department as the best "Report"
I can render for the aid of commerce;
the materials having been gathered 
from <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">sources[?]</span> wholly unique: from
along the Road which Consuls often
have to pass over, but which they
seldom esteem it their privilege to
report upon. It is doubtful I think
if anything like what I am about 
to send can be found in the archive
of the State Department</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
Very truly &amp; respectfully yours<br/>
Peter Strickland<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Inclosure</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A Book entitled "A Voice from the Deep"</p>
