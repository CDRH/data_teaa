      <p class="tei_p">Nassau, Rens. Co. N.Y.<br/>
September 20th 1879</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon William M. Evarts<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As the period, for which I have 
remained leave of absence, from the 
U.S. Commercial Agency at Gaboon 
Equatorial West Africa, will soon
expire; I hasten to inform the Department, 
that I have been seriously
ill during the last few weeks
I am now convalescent, and expect 
to go to New York, in a day or two, 
for medical advice. If the report
is favorable Mrs Bushnell and myself 
purpose sailing October eleventh 
for Liverpool, ene route for 
Gaboon. I will inform you of 
our final decision at the earliest 
day practicable.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have recently received a despatch 
from Rev S. H. Murphy, who was left 
in charge of the Commercial Agency 
informing me that soon after 
my departure, he had been denyed

<span class="hr">Â </span>
    
the privilege of flying the flag,
because the Government at Paris,
had not been officially informed 
of the re establishment of 
the Commercial Agency, after 
its temporary discontinuance.
If I return as Commercial 
Agent, or as Consul; it will
be necessary for the Government 
at Paris, to be officially informed 
of the fact, and an Exequater 
be solicited.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Permit me to add, new forms 
will be needed, and also flags.
As soon as the question of my 
returning in October is decided, 
I shall have the honor of 
making definite requests to 
the Department.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/> 
Sir:<br/>
Most Respectfully,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant,<br/> 
Albert Bushnell<br/>
U.S. Com'l Agent.</p>
