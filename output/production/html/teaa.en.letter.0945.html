      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform the Department that during the months of Mar. or April I addressed a note to Mr. H. L.

      <p class="tei_p">A copy of Mr. Crusoe's reply to me, in which that gentleman informs me that he has resigned the office of Commercial Agent of the United States, and given the Archives of the Agency into the possession of Mr. Cheeseman, is transmitted herewith, marked Enclosure No. 1.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I wrote to Mr. Crusoe the second time, requesting him to explain, for my information, the circumstances of his resignation as mentioned by himself in Enclosure No. 1. of this despatch. After waiting in vain a reasonable time for an explination

<span class="hr"> </span>

from Mr. Crusoe, I addressed a note of inquiry to Mr. Cheeseman. That note was dated 16 July and a copy thereof is enclosed (marked No. 2.) and transmitted herewith.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Not having received a reply from Mr. Crusoe nor from Mr. Cheeseman up to the present time of writing, I regard it my duty to visit Bassa and, in person investigate the circumstances. Hence I shall go thither, the interests of the Government permitting thereof, by the first conveyance leaving Monrovia for that point.</p>
