actually taken to make the transit
was from the 11th day of April A.D.

nine days. I have drawn Five (5)
drafts, on the Secretary of State for
Forty three days compensation allowed
on account of "transit allowance"
I was three days coming from
Wyandotte Kansas to Washington D.C.
Praying that you may approve
my action. I am your obedient 
servant Chas. H. J. Taylor<br/>
U.S. Minister &amp; Consular General</p>
