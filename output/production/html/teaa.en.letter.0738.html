St Paul de Loanda<br/>
13th December 1884</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to report for the information
of the Department that the German Gunboat
"Moẅe" arrived here in the 8th inst: from Angra
Pequena calling at all the ports on her way up.
Dr Nachtigal is on board and proceeds North 
in her, touching at the various ports on her way,
and on reaching St Vincent I understand he
proceeds home, the Moẅe still remaining on
the station. From a conversation I had with
Dr Nachtigal, who stayed at Angra Pequena
while the "Moẅe" went to the Cape, and who
went some distance into the interior, it seems
but a poor place to establish a Colony and 
more resembles a desert than anything else.
Four German Corvettes from the North are 
expected here shortly</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Your most Obedient servant<br/>
