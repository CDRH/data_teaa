            <span class="tei_l">Swirled overmost by Titan winds that toss</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Their limbs and ringlets in the eddying air,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Like death-loosed poets, with their breeze-blown 
hair,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Hymning to mountains, precipice and palm,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Or sighing soft as Seraph's evening psalm—</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Startled by storm burst; stilled in love's 
deep loss,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Listen, O Dream Isles of the Orient Main,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Thy brown elves wake and pour lost Eden's
choral strain!</span>

         <span class="tei_lg_type_stanza tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Thrilled by brown magi from the nymphean
coves</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Old nations sing as if the centuries</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Sighed to the stars some old, lost planet's
love;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Now Egypt breathes; now Babylon, Persia,
Greece,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Through these soft pipes, wake, sighing, like
the groves</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Where gods have wandered, and where winds
are whispering "Peace."</span>
            <span class="tei_l">But hear the flute's sweet eccentricities</span>
            <span class="tei_l">'Neath the white moon, yon castled stream
above,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Till crash of cymbals, turban'd Turks have
known,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And sound's fine rain, and booming of deep
drums,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">(And the brown gnome who pursueth wind
gusts through</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Old Triton's wreathèd shell, he wakes anew—</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Bellowing, like Neptune's rage, with much
ado),</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Drown, with their ocean roar, the little bird</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Whose notes, like dainty Ariel's, laughed
that they were heard.</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Waas it Adonis, wandering alone,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Waked, with sweet lips, the silver piccolo,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Fair Music's nightingale, which sang: "Mine
own,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Mine own, dear Love, dost thou not <em class="hi">know;</em> not know?"</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Now, o'er the hills, is it Apollo comes,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Pouring (oh, hear!) sound's golden honey
down</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The Helicon? But hark! What mellow tide
could drown</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Those silver reeds whose notes go down to
some</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Well's bottom, over crystal rocks? Oh,
come!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Hear music ripple, like a breeze that's 
blown</span>
            <span class="tei_l">O'er ripening fields and Daphne's rosy vale,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Full, deep and resonant! Hear this rose
gale</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Of June's sweet Calliope wake, and all</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The muses rouse from dreamy murmurings!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Hear shout and revel; romp and tipsy call</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Of woodland fairies. List! What siren
sings</span>
            <span class="tei_l">O'er ocean voicings—deep, divinely deep!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">What billowed temptests rage; what surge
and sweep;</span>
            <span class="tei_l">What equal thunderings storm Poseidon's
throne,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And sound Earth's  black abyss!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Now Ares fires</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The clouds, and far his awful symphony fills</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The world. 'Tis war! Embattled Harmony</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Sends Echo flying, golden, to the hills,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">To win brave heights where the winged eagle
tires.</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And oh! the battle music rageth gloriously!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Till, victory won, a last loud bar begins</span>
            <span class="tei_l">With roll of kettledrums, like boom of bees
that drone,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">On heavy wings, down sultry summer
winds,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And unmolested bays where love sees one
white sail.</span>

fauns?</span>
            <span class="tei_l">This Afric' Pan who broke the crystal lip</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Of Sound's lost river; plashed there, and
