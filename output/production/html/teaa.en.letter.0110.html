      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to report to 
the Department the arrival at this
Port of the distinguished African
traveller Henry M. Stanley.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">He reached here on the 21st inst.
on board the Portuguese Man of War
"Rio Tamega" from Cabenda where he 
arrived on the 11th idem, having been
successful in the discovery of the source
of the River Congo which, he proves
without doubt, to be a continuation
of the Lualaba. He has traveled a 
country hitherto unknown and I am
sure his success will be highly
appreciated by every nation. He had
to fight his way in several places the 
natives

<span class="hr"> </span>

natives being in some parts extremely
unfriendly not even allowing him to 
trade for food, but considering he and 
his men more as wild animals, fit
only to be shot at, than human beings.
He passed 57 Cataracts or Rapids above
which the River Congo is navigable 
for vessels of large size for 2000 miles.
After passing all the falls to below
Yellala, and many of his men being
sick and dispirited, he struck across
country for 5 days and came out at
Boma where, he first met English
and Portuguese Traders. From Boma
he proceeded to Cabenda in a steamer
belonging to one of the English houses
at which place he was received on board
the "Rio Tamega". He brings with him
115 natives being all that are left of 
about

about 350 he started with, many having
been lost in the Cataracts. The young
Englishman Frank Pocock who had
accompanied him all this way was
also drowned in passing one of the
Cataracts only some 2 months before their
arrival at Boma. It was at a 
place called Nyangme that he first 
learnt of Captn Cameron's having
accompanied Portuguese Traders to the 
West Coast. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr Stanley speaks in the 
very highest terms of gratitude for
the kind treatment which he and
his men received from the Commander
and Officers of the "Rio Tamega".</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Since his arrival here he has
been treated with the greatest of kindness
by the Portuguese and is staying at 
present

present with Major Serpa Pinto 
and Mr. Brito Capello who are
also about to start for the interior
on a scientific expedition.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Governor Albuquerque is doing 
everything in his power to assist Mr 
Stanley, all his men being kept as
guests of the Government.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I hand a litteral 
translation of an official despatch
received from His Excellency The
Governor congratulating me as 
representative of the American
Nation on the highly successful termination 
of the arduous journey just
