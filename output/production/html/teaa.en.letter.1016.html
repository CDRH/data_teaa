inform you that your
despatch No. 12 dated Sept.
24th 1886 authorizing me
to dispose of the goods of the
late Minister Moses A. Hopkins
in order to pay his funeral 
expenses could not well
be performed. G. T. Hoove 
&amp; Son to whom the
government is indebted
for the funeral expenses
would

would not take them to their
account; nor could I dispose
of them to her profit to any
merchant here; therefore
by her request and by
my own judgement,
I have shipped said goods
back to her with the rest of 
afects the left of her
husband to her home in
Franklinton Franklin
County N.C. I have 
also paid G. T Hoove &amp; Son
for funeral expenses.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hoping to receive your
approval for steps taken</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
