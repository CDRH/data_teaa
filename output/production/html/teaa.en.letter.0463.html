Commercial Agent of the United States,

(now in Washington.)</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to acknowledge the
receipt of your dispatch No. 12,
dated at Culpeper, Virginia, on the 
5th instant, in relation to the relief
of certain citizens of the United States
now on the Congo River, belonging
to a "faith cure sect," and to say 
that there is no appropriation from 
which the passage home of these
people could be paid, destitute
seamen being the only class of
American
   


American citizens entitled by law
to such aid.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
William F Wharton<br/>
Acting Secretary.</p>
