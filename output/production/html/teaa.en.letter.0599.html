      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
Loanda, September 14, 1892</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Heli Chatelain<br/>
To the Department of State.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Subject:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Salary for 1892-1893</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Abstract of Contents</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By suppressing my salary two months before 
I am acquainted with said suppression; by not providing
for my support during the interval, nor for my transit
home, nor for my release from my post, the
government forces upon me a loss of from $800
to $1000; while I have fulfilled my part of our contract.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The appropriation for Mozambique in continued by Congress.
I will not desert my post, but await a cablegram
from the Department, instructing me either to stay,
or to go home, or to close up, or appointing me to
Mozambique under certain conditions. Something should
be done to guard American interests in this Consular
district, and to prevent a crying injustice.</p>
