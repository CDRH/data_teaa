      <p class="tei_p">Commercial Agency of the United States,<br/>
at Loanda, Washington, Feb 10, 1893</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am sorry to have to inform you of
Mr. Ed. Bannister's irregular conduct in
various matters:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(1) In the settlement of Judson's estates
he kept some money (about $100.-) which
I already mentioned in a previous despatch,
and which I doubt he ever paid to the
Treasury; and he refused to return to me
some papers he had asked of me for said
settlement.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(2) Unbeknown to me he corresponded
as U.S. Vice-Consul with the Chicago Exhibition,
bought and sent to them a native canoe and
machila, telling the people at Loanda that
my appointment as Commercial Agent did
not interfere with his as Vice-Consul.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(3) I hear that since my departure

<span class="hr"> </span>

and the closing of the Consulate officially
made known in the government's Official 
Bulletin for Angola, he still claim to be
and signs himself as U.S. Vice-Consul.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(4) This is the more reprehensible as Mr.
Bannister is acting British Consul at
Loanda and appointed British Consul for
the Kongo Free State.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It might be well for the Department
to stop Mr. Bannister's unlawful use 
of said title by informing the public of
Angola through the Governor and the Official
Bulletin that Mr. Bannister has no
right to act as, or call himself, U.S.
Vice-Consul.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Heli Chatelain</p>
