      <p class="tei_p">Sir-</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour to

and herewith return the bonds and 
oath of office to the department executed; 
I was born in the state of Virginia U.S.A. 
My parent emigrated to Liberia while I was 
quite young, shortly after there death I returned 
to America and lived in Boston Massachusetts
until 1870 at the end of said year I was employed 
by the American Col. Society as Doctor to 
attend Emigrants in Liberia at which place I 
remained until 1876, After which I came to 
Sierra Leone where I now reside.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I cannot say which state I have been appointed 
from unless I claim Boston Mass as it is the 
only state I have resided in since leaving
Virginia <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">excepting[?]</span> the time spent on the coast of Africa.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have never resided in Great Britain and 
have only lived in Sierra Leone one of her <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Dependencies[?]</span>
since January 1877.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir</p>
