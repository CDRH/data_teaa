      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
your dispatches Nos 2 and 3. to which I beg to reply.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Consular property has been siezed by Mssrs 
Harris &amp; Co for the expenses of the American Consulate only. The amount claimed is exorbitant, and 
they have no agreement or contract of any kind to 
show that they are entitled to that amount. Up 
to the time of the departure of the late Consul 
W. Hogan Esq: Messrs Harris &amp; Co received all the fees 
of the Consulate, by private arrangement with the 
said W. Hogan. They are not therefore entitled to
any thing up to August 1st last. Be pleased to 
instruct me in this matter.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I should suggest a settlement by arbitration 
fully believing such a course practicable.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to remain<br/> 
Sir<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
Nathl Lyons<br/>
U.S. Consul for
Sierra Leone &amp;c.</p>
