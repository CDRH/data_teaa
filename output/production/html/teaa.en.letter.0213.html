      <p class="tei_p">1039 Lombard Street,<br/>
Philadelphia, Pa.<br/>
November 20th, 1890.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In the short interview with which you honored
me on Friday last, I informed you I that had been
commissioned by the President of Liberia to approach
your Government with the hope that you would be
induced to make such a demonstration in our favor
as will prevent foreign nations from making 
encroachments on our territory.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Unfortunately for me, the presence of business did 
not permit of your giving me time to lay the facts 
before you and you told me to call the next day, which
I did and I called again on the following Monday 
and Tuesday; but with no better success owing to the 
great pressure of business in your office.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As I had to leave your city, on Tuesday last I make
bold <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">to[?]</span> adopt this method of laying the matter before
you, trusting that you will be kind enough to give it 
your consideration.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In the year 1885 a French Man of War came into
the harbour of our capital, Monrovia and the  
Com- mander

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">The Honble James G. Blaine,<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

mander called upon the President. During the conversation
the Commander said that he had stopped 
at Bereby — a place within our boundary line and 
had an interview with the chiefs. The President asked 
"Why did you stop there and have that interview? Do 
you not know that territory belongs to Liberia?" The
Commander replied that he did not know it belonged to Liberia 
and that he had been instructed by his Government to
stop there and have that interview.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">After the departure of the vessel, the President instructed  
our Representative in Paris to call the attention of 
the French Government to the action of their office and 
to point out the fact that our boundary on the South
East extended to the San Pedro River as you will see by
referring to the Imperial Atlas in your Office and 
that they had virtually admitted it by their Naval Charts
and otherwise.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The French Government then claimed that they 
had commercial treaties with the chiefs of Berreby
as old as 1846 I think; but we have Deeds of Cession
of that territory made to us as far back as 1836, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>
      </p>
      <p class="tei_p">We laid this matter before your Government and asked
for your kind offices; and in a Despatch to Mr. McLean
dated, January 13th 1886, Mr. Bayard instructed how to 
interview and to say to the French Government "We exercise 
no protectorate over Liberia; but the circumstances, that
the Republic originated through the Colonization of 
American citizens and was established under the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">foster[?]</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

ing sanction of this Government give us the right as 
the next friend of Liberia to aid her in preventing any 
encroachment of foreign powers on her territorial 
sovereignty and in settling any dispute that may arise.
The South easterly boundary at the River San Pedro has never
been questioned and the powerful sanction of general 
admission for many years."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The matter has remained in abeyance as we supposed 
since that time; but it lately came to our knowledge that 
one Captain Binger — who was a prominent officer in 
the late expedition against the King of Dahomey — claim
to have made explorations in the near and South east
of Liberia and he has published, in a "Supplement 
Le Temps Mars 1890," a map representing Liberia as a very
narrow strip along the coast, representing the country in
the immediate rear of Liberia as far as Musardu as 
"unexplored" country and liable to become a Protectorate of France,
although our Mr. B. Anderson had explored that country as 
far as Musardu and published an account of this journey 
and cutting off our territory on the Southeast up
to the Cavalla River thus taking the very territory in dispute
and which Mr. Bayard says belongs to us by "the powerful
sanction of general admission for many years." The territory <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">retaken[?]</span>
from us is represented in his map of French Territory.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Whilst the French have not as yet made an open 
movement towards taking possession of our territory 
yet, Mr. Secretary under the circumstances we feel warranted

<span class="hr"> </span>

warranted in appealing to your Government as "<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Liberia's[?]</span>
next Friend" and asking you to make such a demonstration 
in our favor as will prevent Foreign Governments 
from making such encroachments on our territory.
If your powerful Government would make us a present 
of one of your smallest steam-gunboats to be used in 
guarding our coast from foreigners and preventing
them from settling at points remote from our civilized 
settlements and tampering with the aborigines we feel
that our territorial limits will not be encroached upon.
Mr. Secretary my Government believes that if you will 
be pleased to give us the benefit of your kind offices and
and will induce His Excellency the President to recommend 
the giving of this vessel to Liberia we shall be successful
and the very recommendation by the President 
will indicate to the world the friendship of the United 
States for our little Republic.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Trusting, Mr. Secretary, that you will bring this 
matter to the notice of His excellency the President,
and that you will advise his recommending it to the Congress
and trusting that you will pardon my trespassing on 
your valuable time.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your humble Servant<br/>
W. M. Davis<br/>
Liberian Commissioner</p>
