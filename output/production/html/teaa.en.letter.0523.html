      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States<br/>
Loanda, December 5, 1888.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable G. L. Rives<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to 
acknowledge the receipt of two
despatches from the Department
Nos 19, 20, and dated October 2,
the former requesting me to resume
my duties as Vice Consul of the 
United States at this port in
accordance with my appointment
dated October 17, 1868, which
I have much pleasure in doing,
and as I did as in the interest of
the government on the 8th of
November after Mr. Judson's
death, as already advised to the
Department, I shall date my 
resumption of duties from that
day.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With



With reference to Despatch No 20
I am unable to give a satisfactory
solution, Mr. Judson having died
as stated on the 8th November, and
on taking charge I found all
Consular affairs in the utmost 
confusion. I found copies of
some letters to the Department &amp;c
on loose sheets of paper, but nothing
has been copied into any Book
since Mr. Downing left, and I can 
find no copies of Accounts of any
kind, or anything that will enable
me to clear up the items you refer
to. There is a pencil note referring
to a Flag staff, and a large stand
for Archives, which do not exist. As
for a Flag staff I know personally
that such a thing was never erected
on the dwelling occupied by Mr.
Downing and subsequently by Mr.
Judson.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I forward to the Department a
complete inventory of what I consider
as belonging to the Consulate and
which



which I have removed to my office
and put into as good order as possible.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">No Official paper nor Flag exist,
and I am afraid I shall find myself
short of many useful forms. Everything 
I found in the greatest disorder,
many forms being entirely spoilt by
want of care, and others eaten but
white ants and other insects that 
destroy such things in this climate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Neither Mr. Downing nor Mr. 
Judson have kept up the credit of
the nation they had the honor to
represent, the former having done
all he could to damage the credit
of any future Consul who may be
appointed to Loanda, as no one here
will now take a draft drawn by
an American Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Draft drawn by Mr. Downing
on the Department in favor of Messrs:
Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co for $244. 12/100
and now in the hands of F. A. Silva
of Charlestown, and which has 
not been paid, was cashed by
my



my firm out of pity as Mr. Downing
had no money to pay for board
and lodging and would have been
obliged to leave the hotel, and
it secures to me unfair that a 
Draft for the same amount and 
bearing the same date in favor
of Mr. McDonald should have 
been preferred and paid. The
other draft for $262.50/100 which has
been paid, was cashed to allow
him to pay for hire of furniture
House Rent and Doctor's Bill to
enable him to leave this place,
but I since find he has paid some
of these debts.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With reference to Mr. Baines,
his nomination would have been
of non-effect as he has since become
bankrupt and has left the country.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When Mr. Downing came here
from Liverpool he drew on my firm
a Draft for his passage money £35
without any advice, and without 
any knowledge of or acquaintance
with



with my firm, or my firm <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
which shows he had us conscience
where money was concerned.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In your despatch to Mr. Judson
also dated October 2, you say
Mr. Downing states he had a 
verbal argument with him to
draw the salary having given
Judson an equivalent. This I
believe was not the case, as I
was led to understand that Mr.
Judson paid him a certain amount
for the right to draw the salary.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I also know that Mr. Downing
tried to make similar arrangements
with another party here best did
not succeed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As for Mr. Judson he has 
never been well received by
the Portuguese. He was fond of
low company, wining after with
the lower classes and convicts and
drinking with them.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Here $151.28/100 for Furniture and
Flag staff I have already explained
that



that wove of these articles exist.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Item. $147.68/100. I have seen
Mr. Quadrio who seized the archives
and who says Mr. Judson promised
to pay him but never did so, so I 
cannot see that his Draft is justifiable.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Item. $158 48/100 For relief of destitute
seamen. I can give no explanation 
of this as I can find no document 
relating to it. I only know that 
he had one or two sick sailors in
charge for some time</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With reference to the Despatch
to Mr. Judson relative to the seaman
John Hass I can give no explanation
as I see nothing in the archives
referring to it.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have notified to the acting
Governor General my resumption
of the duties of the Consulate, who
in his reply expresses his great
satisfaction that the Consulate of 
the United States of America will
resume its regular functions in the
hands of one who knows how to
maintain



maintain the dignity of the country
he represents.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I have no record of prior
dispatches of Mr. Judson's I cannot
follow on his numbers, I commenced
therefore on November 15, last,
at No. 1</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Robt S. Newton<br/>
Vice Consul.</p>
