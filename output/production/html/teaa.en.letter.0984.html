      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is to be hoped in view of the recent information furnished the Department and country through the report upon Liberia that our commercial community will turn its attention to Liberia</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The treaty relations subsisting between the U.S. and Liberia up to this time have been of greater advantage to this Government and its people than to the U.S. and its citizenship.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For

<span class="hr"> </span>

For many years our navy has been under the treaty, at the disposial of Liberia whenever threatened by its aboriginal people with insubordination or rebellion.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In this aspect of our interest in the Republic our relation has been more in the nature of a protectorate without consequent benefit to us, than a merely friendly nation.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In this view I would respectfully submit that reciprocity should have its full influence, this portion of western Africa should of its wealth add to the revenues of the U.S. and enrich by its products our mercantile

<span class="hr"> </span>

mercantile class.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The apathy of American merchants as to this country heretofore, may have been due to a want of proper information as to its resources; but now with an enlarged knowledge of Liberia, it is to be hoped that their own interest may dictate the wisdom the wisdom of entering this commercial field so rich in promise.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There are here German, Holandish and English houses, established at Robertsport, Monrovia, Bassa, Sinou &amp; Cape Palmas.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am credibly advised that these houses reap large profits, and this is more fully verified 

<span class="hr"> </span>

verified by their long existence in the country. These houses sell a great many articles that are manufactured in the U.S., sent to Europe and thence here.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There is not an American establishment in the country, notwithstanding the prestige our relation to Liberia has given the Republic. This ought to be otherwise.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The people buy our tobacco, flour, cloth, rice, salt meat &amp; fish, shoes, canned meat, fruit &amp; vegetables, and pay two and three hundred per cent to these foreign and Liberian houses in profits</p>
      <p class="tei_p">My predecessor in his No. 273, dated Sept. 3, 1877, gave a very faithful

<span class="hr"> </span>

faithful picture of the great expense of living here. The influence upon the Government and people of this grinding oppression to sustain life–is obvious. American competition will have a double effect for good enriching our countrymen and relieving this people.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Could our manufacturers and merchants not send their commodities direct to the country, establish American houses, reduce the price of living, and by the superiority of our products and manufactured goods make satisfactory profits?</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The preference of the Liberians for American products and goods

<span class="hr"> </span>

goods is in our favor, the interest our country has shown in this Republic, is an incentive to us to secure and maintain a commercial foothold here.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The interior will shortly be pierced by Liberia, since the Government is convinced that the future of this Negro state is on the uplands, beyond the mountain, not on the coast.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">With considerations of esteem, permit me to subscribe myself,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your obd't serv't,<br/>
Jno. H. Smyth,<br/>
U.S. Consul Gen'l</p>
