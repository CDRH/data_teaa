      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As illustrating the growing popularity 
of the idea of self-government
or complete independence, among
the whites as well as natives of Angola
and the echo the same idea is finding
in Portugal, I have the honor to 
enclose two extracts of Portuguese
papers on the subject.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Extract no. 1 is from the "Seculo",
by far the most popular paper of Portugal.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Extract no. 2 is from a new Angolan
paper, the "Commercio d' Angola",
founded by one of the oldest and
most influential white resident.
He is the father-in-law of a former
Governor and of six of the principal

<span class="hr"> </span>

public officers and merchants.
St. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Tarora[?]</span>, referred to in Extract no. 2,
is a descendant of an old aristocratic family
and has been for about thirty years
an honored judge in the higher courts
of the different Portuguese colonies.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Extract no. 1
From the "Seculo" of Lisbon</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Translation.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Independence of Angola.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The newspaper of the important
colony are again concerned about
the state of the Province and
the negligence with which it is
treated by the government of the
metropolis. One of them, thus
finishes an editorial on this
subject.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Let therefore, the unanimous
and arousing cry of all be
"the independence of Angola".
In another article, the following may be read:
"This cannot, nor shall it, continue. The
government is secretly selling the colonies
and we do not want to be English. Therefore,
the only alternative left us is to proclaim
the independence (autonomy) of the Province,
imploring the protection of the United States
of North-America. This, as is well known

<span class="hr"> </span>

would not be difficult; it will be done
the day we want it. It is, however,
to be lamented, that good and loyal Portuguese,
who long for the greatness of their country, and
love their native land, be forced by their 
ill-omened government to co-operate in
the disintegration of the fatherland."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In another article, mentioning an
injustice committed in S. Thomé, one
reads: "It becomes necessary for us
to change our minds, far from the present
regimen we can expect nothing but injustice
and contempt."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Thus it is that the government by
its favoritism and that of its delegates
is estranging the sympathies of the colonies
and pushing them to revolt.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">When the thing is done, it will be too late
to repent.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Extract No. 2.
From the "Commercio d'Angola" no. 3.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Translation of marked Passage</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"It is one more competent
&amp; authoritative voice, &amp; demonstrate
the lack of wisdom with which the
central government legislate, as a
rule, for the colonies, and to prove 
the absolute necessity of granting
to some of them their administrative
autonomy. . . . . . .</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The idea of autonomy has acquired,
in these last times, a great prominence
in the minds of these who love their
country with genuine enthusiasm.
By granting autonomy to Angola,
Portugal would reap two enormous
advantages:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(1) The reduction of deficit in
the colonial budget</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(2) The rapid increase of the
indirect receipts by the development
of commerce.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Portuguese government has

<span class="hr"> </span>

already admitted the advisability of 
self-government, by turning our the administration
of certain parts of East-Africa to chartered
companies. But circumstances will force
it to carry out this principle more efficaciously, 
if it will not run the risk
of losing, sooner or later, its sovereignty."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">P.S. The "Correro de Portugal" of Lisbon,
(devoted to colonial questions) thus begins its
editorial of July 6: "One of the gravest
symptoms is the cry of independence which
is being heard in almost all the colonies.
The Azores, Madeira, S. Thomé and Angola 
already openly raise the banner of
revolt and of annexation to the United States
of America; and in East-Africa, where the
Portuguese element is scanty; There is no
dislike of becoming part of the proposed
Federation of South-African States." And
the editorial, though lamenting the spirit
of disaffection towards Portugal goes
on to show that it is justified.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I may add that again and again whites and
natives say to me, or in my hearing: "Why don't
the United States try to get us?"</p>
