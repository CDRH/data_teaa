<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Anna Boardman Smith was a white American missionary stationed in Africa from 1902 to 1914 at the Kunso Wesleyan Mission and Kono Station in Sierra Leone. She is the author of <em><a href="teaa.en.book.0028">Glimpses Into African Mission Life</a></em> (1911) in which she details her "call to service" and the "customs of the Temne People," to whom she proselytize. Anna was born in Vermont. At age 10, she was baptized into the Wesleyan Methodist Church. She was educated and taught for one year in public schools before marrying <a href="teaa.img.0054">Willard C. Boardman</a>. She traveled with him to Africa, where they commenced their missionary work. Boardman died from a fever, and Anna later married J. Hal Smith, five days after making his acquaintance. She remained in Africa until 1914 or 1915, when illness forced her to "leave the field."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>The cameo portrait was typical of the period, despite its prevailing association with the Victorian period. Lauren Miskin writes that: "Cameos had much in common with photographs, as both were newly democratized, easily reproducible forms of portraiture that came to be associated with the middle class."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Much like cameo jewelry, the portrait form of women was meant to convey femininity. This was especially important for female travelers abroad and residents of foreign lands deemed "inhospitable" or "savage." In this context, Smith's picture portrays a demure, American, Christian femininity that remained steadfast while in Africa&#x2013;an image that Smith herself cultivated while in the mission field.</p>
