      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor respectfully to acknowledge the receipt of the coat of arms &amp; ruler, a seal for Commercial Agent at Cape Coast Castle, but no information as to any action of the Dep't as to the appointment of such officer.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">You would oblige me and satisfy the needs of the Legation and Consulate by sending at the earliest convenience a full and complete set of blanks, as by

Ass't Sec'y of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

by deficiency of them, I am frequently under necessity of copying forms needed from the "Consular Regulations."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The blanks here, are, in consequence of their former depository, dampness peculiar to the rainy seasons, and I doubt not, neglect of the attendant or attendants of my predecessor, in very bad condition, and by no means complete.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
With high considerations of esteem,<br/>
Your obd't serv't,<br/>
Jno. H. Smyth</p>
