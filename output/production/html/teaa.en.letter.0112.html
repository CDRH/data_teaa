      <p class="tei_p">United States Commercial Agency<br/>
St Paul de Loanda<br/>
16th October 1877.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to 
acknowledge the receipt of your
communication dated 15th August
1887, informing me that the President
of the United States had appointed
Mr. Joseph E. Jackson of 
Michigan to be consul of the 
United States for this place, and 
instructing me to deliver over to 
him all the records, archives &amp;c
of the Consulate. Which instructions 
I will promptly carry out on the 
arrival of that gentleman.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would wish respectfully
to bring to the notice of His Honor
the



the President, that I have
faithfully carried out the duties 
of this Consulate as, sometimes
Acting Commercial Agent, and at
others as Vice Commercial Agent, for
8 years with, I trust, dignity to 
the State, that I have at all
times assisted and entertained American
subjects who have been in distress or
visited this place, and I feel acutely
this unexpected action of being superceded. 
I would also most respectfully
point out the peculiarly unhealthy
nature of the climate here, which it
requires many years to become accustomed
to, many fevers and much sickness
must be passed through before one
becomes acclimatized, and it is not
everyone whose strength can bear it

as our rapidly increasing Cemetry
can shew. I would also mention
that house rent and food have 
increased of late years to such
an alarming extent that no one,
unless with other employment on 
hand, could exist on the pay
at present allotted to the
Representatives of the United States
here. I merely mention these facts
for your consideration, so that the 
gentleman coming out here may
be made acquainted with what he 
will have to put up with in Loanda.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Your most obedt Servt.<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
Vice Commercial Agent.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">F. W. Seward Esqr<br/>
Acting Secretary<br/>
Department of State<br/>
Washington.</p>
