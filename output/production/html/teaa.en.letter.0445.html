      <p class="tei_p">To<br/>
Hon John Davis<br/>

Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to state that upon the receipt 
of Despatch No. 12 from the State Dept, I went
South by order of my medical adviser, and 
visited Benguella, Catumbella &amp; Equimina Bay.
"Catumbella is the center of commerce of 
the interior of Benguella, and the great
rendezvous of all the caravans from
Balindu and Bihé, I appointed Mr 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Passens[?]</span> the chief agent of the Dutch
African Trading Co. there, to be the agent for
the Am: Mission of Balindu &amp; Bihé
Equimina Bay is the great rendezvous
of Am: Whalers and Mr Bastas Pina
a Brazilian gentleman is the owner of
the whole bay and has very fine
plantation of coffee, cotton, sugar &amp;a
he furnishes also vegetables meat water
wood &amp;a to the whalers having no customs
duties established there, the whalers

<span class="hr"> </span>

have made the bay their Head quarters.
On my return south my health was not improved
at all, and the Doctors ordered me to leave
at once for the U.S. and gave me a certificate
to that effect which I forward in another
despatch. I left Loanda for my Northern
Jurisdiction about a month ago, Ambriz
is worst than Loanda, but from Kinsembo
to Banana Congo, the coast which is still
under the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> rule, is covered with
foreign trading houses.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At Banana Am: Whalers are seen almost
daily during the Whaling season and
Anchor there for water &amp; provisions. I
have forwarded in another despatch
my report on the Congo. While in Banana
and waiting on a sick bed for the mail steamer to
Loanda, the U.S.S. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Quinnebang[?]</span> Comdr 
Nicholl Ludlow, landed and took
me on board and brought me here</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Ls de R du Verge<br/>
US Consul</p>
