         <h3>The Negro Seer: His Preparation and Mission.</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="article">
         <p class="tei_p">I am glad I am not an ox. With Terence, I say, "I am
a man." Man is just a little lower than the angels. He carries 
the impress of divinity; is differentiated from other animals 
by the moral element, the faculty of reason, and a superior 
mentality which is capable of a marvelous development.
These characteristics belong to every variety of the human
race. Nevertheless, in 1861, at Savannah, Georgia, Senator
A. H. Stevens declared that the foundations of the Confederacy 
"are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that
the Negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery—subordination 
to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Beginning with Count Gobineau, in 1854, a small school
of anthropologists have undertaken to prove that, by the fiat
of God, there are inferior and superior branches of the human
race. These savants base their arguments upon cephalometry,
orthognathism, that is, measurements of the head, the face,
the jaws, etc. They measure the nose. The longer the nose
the more he knows. The flatter the nose the less he knows.
They measure the height, the breast, the ear, the feet. They

<span class="hr"> </span>

note his color, his eyes, his smell. They bring to their aid
arguments physiological, pathological, psychological. They
argue for polygenesis, denying monogenesis of the human
race. Hence, they have engendered race friction, race hatred,
between the white and the brown, and the black, and often
between branches of the same color. This hatred is one time
turned against the Jews, another, against the Japanese, or
again, against the Negro.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The causes of the variations in the different branches of
the human race are many and apparent. Action of climate,
diseases, nourishment, mode of life, the whole environment,
the milieu, as the French would say, are causes of race variation. 
We now know that in Africa there are all kinds of
colors and hair depending upon the environment. The Scandinavian, 
living among his snow-capped hills, is almost color-
less. The Antisians of Peru, living at the point of rocks, beneath 
a forest impenetrable to the rays of the sun, are whiter
than those of their own blood about them. We are affected
by our geological habitat. As the minerals and moisture of
certain soils produce a small, scrubby forest, so "a granite and
sterile soil producing only rye, buckwheat, potatoes, and
chestnuts" produces a people remarkable for their narrow
shoulders, tight chests, lymphatic temperament. Potassium,
iron, magnesia, lime, sulphur, arsenic, the rays of the sun,
the winds, the forests, the rivers, all affect our size, color,
nose, head, feet, chest, temperament.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There are to-day, we are told, men of purest Jewish blood

<span class="hr"> </span>

whose color is the whitest of the white, the brownest of the
brown, the blackest of the black. A careful study of science
and history indicates that the centuries to come will produce
a typical American whose color will be red.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But moral influence has greatest effect in producing race
variety. Norton tells us that Negro children born in liberty
have more beautiful eyes, a more elegant appearance, and an
easier bearing.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The arguments for the unity of the race are many and
convincing. The blood of a dog injected into the veins of a
Frenchman will destroy the one or both. The blood of a
Negro or Jap may be injected into a Frenchman's veins with
impunity. Liebnitz, Blumenbach, Agassiz, Finot, all the leading 
anthropologists of the world, tell us that there is but one
human race. No two black-eyed peas are alike and yet they
are peas. The babies of all races cry alike.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There are forward and backward branches of the race
caused by environment But will the backward always remain 
backward? The Japs were backward sixty years ago.
Are they backward to-day?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Negro is a branch of the human race, and has, therefore, 
inherently, all the capabilities of the other branches. This
is attested by the achievements of many Negroes of purest
blood. John C. Calhoun once said: "If I could find a Negro
who knew Greek Syntax, I would believe the Negro was a
human being and ought to be treated as a man." To-day, in
response to the promise of such distinguished consideration,

<span class="hr"> </span>

we can present an overwhelming array of scholars, publicists,
generals, etc. There were Clitus, the black general of the
army of Alexander the Great; Phillis Wheatly, the little African 
girl, whose poetry extorted praise from General George
Washington; Benjamin Banneker, the astronomer and friend
of Thomas Jefferson; Congressman R. B. Elliot; J. C. Price,
the orator; Edward W. Blyden, whom Europe regards as one
of the greatest scholars of the world; J. W. E. Bowen, the
theologian; M. C. B. Mason, the publicist; Dunbar, the poet;
Toussaint L. Ouverture, the warrior; several distinguished
men wearing the honor of knighthood conferred by Queen
Victoria, and legions of others.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But you say these are of purest Negro blood; the crossbreed, 
the mulatto, the octaroon, is a failure, weakling physically 
and mentally. Where are the distinguished mixed
bloods? Here they are: Ishmael, son of Abraham by
Hagar; Menelek, son of Solomon and the African Queen of
Sheba; Alexander Dumas, the French novelist; Robert
Browning, the English poet; Poushkin, Russia's greatest poet;
Ira Aldridge, the actor; Sainte-George, the first vice-president
of the French Deputies; a President each of Bolivia, Venezuela, 
and Mexico; H. O. Tanner, who as artist is the wonder of Europe; 
Edmonia Lewis, the sculpturess; Fred Douglass, America's greatest 
orator; W. E. D. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, and Alexander 
Hamilton, America's great statesman, and greatest financier!</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Now, this argument is not made in advocacy of amalgamation;

<span class="hr"> </span>

but it is made to show that whether amalgamation or
not, every man, of every branch of the human race, of every
color, who wears the mark of divinity, apart from external 
influences, is inherently as good as any other man. Nor is this
trying to run away from the Negro race. It is the proper exaltation 
of the man of whatever human variety.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have never believed a Negro was superior to the white
man—never! I have never believed the Japanese was superior 
to the Englishman—never.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Noble blood, bah! What blood is more noble, or so
pure as that of the lion ? And yet he is only a brute. It is
merit, education, virtue, not blood, that lifts men above the
level of the brutes!"</p>
         <p class="tei_p">So we may conclude that the Negro scholar, the Negro Seer, 
has inherently all the possibilities possessed by any other
branch of the human race.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The world despises a weakling, a coward. Effort is
necessary to growth. As Robert Browning says:</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"No. When the fight begins within himself,<br/>
A man's worth something, God looks o'er his head.<br/>
Satan looks up between his feet—both tug—<br/>
He's left himself i' the middle; the soul awakes<br/>
And grows. Prolong that battle his life."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Great financial enterprises gravitate about thinkers. The
progress of the world regulates its footsteps by the pulse-beats
of the thinker. The X-Ray by which we see the lungs of the
living, the ship in which we sail in mid-heaven, wireless telegraphy 
by which we send our messages through the trackless

<span class="hr"> </span>

air, the submarine boat in which we fight our battles beneath
the waters—these are matters of grey-matter.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There are no mergers in scholarship. The trusts may
control the landscape, but not the beauty of the flowers. No
legislative enactment can control aesthetic taste, noble feeling,
high thinking, honest effort.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Benjamin Hill, Senator from Georgia, is reported to have
remarked that twenty ordinary white men are worth more to
civilization than all the Negroes who have lived in the last
six thousand years. The remark is not true, but is indicative
of a prevalent feeling in many quarters. We are being weighed
in the balances. The test is rigid and exacting. We must
stand up or fall down. We must run or get off the track.
There is no mercy, no quarter. We ask no quarter. All we
want is a fair chance to run. Let us prepare for the contest.
In our preparation we must understand that right will ultimately 
win. Might is no longer right. Right is right. The King of Belgium 
is responsible to all the world for the horrors
of the Congo. Russia must answer to the world for the horrors 
of Kishinev. Individuals and nations are accountable to
the, "parliament of man, the federation of the world."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Truth crushed to earth will rise again,<br/>
The eternal years of God are hers;<br/>
But error, wounded, writhes in pain,<br/>
And dies among his worshippers."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">No man ever followed the path of virtue in vain. Men
and nations ultimately get what they deserve. There is power
in goodness. Greatness is goodness. Goodness wins. Character

<span class="hr"> </span>

tells. Character compels. If this be true, God, the source
of all goodness, should hold first place in our preparation.
What God wills finally triumphs in history. God is not ancient history. 
Was is the wrong, tense for God. God is. God works to-day in the hearts 
of individuals, in the universe.
As President Hyde says: "The man who makes the will of
God the basis of his character and the motive of his conduct,
carries with him the germ of Christianity; for this principle,
rightly apprehended, covers the whole life. The man who
has it will be kind and considerate in his home, upright and
honest in his work, public spirited in civic and political relations, 
socially courteous and sincere, sympathetic with the suffering, 
generous to the poor, helpful to the weak. On the
other hand, he will resist oppression, expose hypocrisy, denounce 
injustice, rebuke fraud, fight for timely and rational
reform. He will do these things whether they are profitable
or costly, popular or unpopular; whether they bring thanks
or curses, praise or blame; whether men strew his path with
palms and hail him with hosannas, or crown him with thorns
and nail him to the cross." We live to make others richer,
happier, better; to elevate the beautiful, to enthrone truth.
"Thus the person who has grown up through faithful doing
of the right into loving devotion to the good, finds every place
a holy place, every bush upon the roadside ablaze with God,
every circumstance, where duty can be done and good can be
accomplished, a gateway to heaven, an approach to the throne
of the Most High!"</p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">The love of God embraces the altruistic spirit. Our
courses of study should be such that no one should receive a
diploma from any college unless the sweep of his love takes in
all men. Hate kills; kills the hater more than the hated.
Love ennobles; ennobles the lover more than the loved. Some
one has said: "I love a good hater." That's wrong. The
world loves a good lover.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Jesus is the incarnation of altruistic love. His character
shall ultimately fill the whole earth; dominate every interest.
Him we should love. Him we should study. We study the
life of Washington. We should study the life of Jesus more.
Washington ruled a small segment of the human race.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Jesus shall reign wher'er the sun,<br/>
Doth his successive journeys run;<br/>
His kingdoms spread from shore to shore,<br/>
Till moons shall wax and wane no more."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We should cut out of our vocabulary such words as
"sheeny," "dago," "hill billy," "poor buckra," "nigger," etc.
They are not fit expressions of a scholar and a gentleman.
They do not fit a man wearing the image of God.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">He who thus stirs up race hatred is an enemy to the world.
Alcibiades arrayed the poor of Athens against the rich.
Athens was at her zenith. When the conflict was over, Athens
was in a mass of ruins, and rich and poor alike were homeless.
The rich of Paris sneered at the poor. Voltaire called them
a "mixture of bear and monkey." But "the people hung him,
stuck his head upon a spike and stuffed his mouth with grass,
amid the plaudits of a grass-eating  people." France was

<span class="hr"> </span>

drenched in blood, her nobles were beheaded, her fame degraded.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The prophets of evil, of racial wars, the fomentors of discontent, 
of our country, of whatever element of the human
race, should be relegated to the rear.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Atlanta riot will be an exception. Ex-Governor
Northen, a committee of noble white and colored men are getting 
together to prevent another calamity like that one. Soon
the better angel in all of us will be aroused. Hence, I look
to the future with joyous anticipation. This nation will not
be destroyed in hatred by fire, and shot and shell. Too much
love and mercy and Christ abound.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We should seek peace between the white and black people
of our country. Peace is essential to mental, spiritual, and
material growth. Without peace all is lost. Why should not
the whites and blacks exercise a little common sense and treat
each other right? That is what we must do and will do.
Racial conditions in the South furnish a splendid opportunity
to test the greatness of the white race. The Greeks secured
liberty to the Greeks; all others to them were barbarians.
The Romans secured liberty to the Romans; all others were
despised. The white American can prove himself superior
to the Greek and the Roman, can prove his religion superior
only if he is strong enough to treat with absolute justice the
backward, undeveloped black man. The black man should
see to it that no blame attaches to him. He sould deserve the
best, be worthy a man's treatment. If he does this, there are

<span class="hr"> </span>

evidences that the white man will give him a man's chance.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The positive evidence of the sincere friendship of the
white South for the black man is attested by such distinguished
Southern white men as Prof. Edgar Gardner Murphy, who
says: "The educational policy of a genuine patriotism will include 
all the children of the unprivileged, white as well as
black." By Bishop C. B. Galloway, who says: "We must
insist that the Negro have equal opportunity with every American 
citizen to fulfill in himself the highest purposes of an all-
wise and beneficent Providence." . . . "Indisputable facts
attest the statement that education and its attendant influences
have elevated the standard and tone of morals among the Negroes 
in the South." By ex-Congressman Fleming, of Georgia, who says: 
"Let us solve the Negro problem by giving the
Negro justice and applying to him the recognized principles of
the moral law. This does not require social equality. It does
not require that we should surrender into his inexperienced and
incompetent hands the reins of political government. But it
does require that we recognize his fundamental rights as a man,
and that we judge each individual according to his own qualifications, 
and not according to the lower average characteristics of his race. 
Political rights can not justly be withheld
from those American citizens of an inferior or backward race
who raise themselves up to the standard of citizenship which
the superior race applies to its own members."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In our preparation, we must remember that while we may
not approve race discrimination, it is nevertheless a valuable

<span class="hr"> </span>

asset. If we cannot get a sleeper, we must rough it, discipline
our temper, harden our character, and save our money. The
refusal of a clerk to fit shoes on a colored girl was the cause
of a prosperous shoe store run by Negroes. The refusal to
rent to Negroes was the cause of the organization of the Metropolitan 
Mercantile and Realty Company of New York, whose
assets run into thousands. The protest against Negro writers
in the Sunday-school literature of the Baptist Publication Society 
caused the organization of the Negro Baptist Publication
Society. It is a fine, exhilerating, strenuous job to be a Negro.
Our white friends ought to try it awhile. One month would
do.  It is calculated to bring out the best in a man.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Sweet arc the uses of adversity,
Which, like the load, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In our preparation there should be the spirit of sacrifice.
The Roman exclaimed: "Dulce et decorum est pro patria
mori." It should be sweet to us to sacrifice for our people.
We should cry with Knox, "Lord, give me Scotland or I die."
We cannot give our millions like Carnegie, but we can do more
important service—we can give ourselves, our love, our
thought, our spirit. Says Carlyle: "It is only with renunciation 
that life, properly speaking, can be said to begin. . . .
Ina valiant suffering for others, not in a slothful making others
suffer for us, did nobleness ever lie." This is all comprehended 
in the words of Jesus, "Whosoever will come after Me, let
him deny himself."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The building of happy homes is the next mission. The

<span class="hr"> </span>

most serious mistake of the Negro to-day is his failure to buy
land. The only fixed and stable citizens of any country are
the land owners. We should buy land anywhere, everywhere,
much or little, rich or poor, and when we get it, keep it. Get
a lot, a few acres, or many acres. On it build a home. Beautify 
the house, plant flowers, set out an orchard, paint the
fence, adorn that house with a few good books; found it
upon honesty, truthfulness, cheerfulness, sobriety, family
prayer, the sweet songs of Zion; let Jesus be the constant unseen 
guest; let love of a dear mother, of a precious wife, of 
innocent, prattling, smiling children sanctify that home; let
patience, tenderness and mercy guide it; let filial love and
parental affection guard its threshold, and you have laid the
foundation of a prosperous and great people. Be it remembered, 
too, that the happiest homes are not always the richest.
The happiest homes are those where dwell love, harmony, kindness, 
unselfishness. Riches? What is mother worth? Don't
you remember when she tucked the cover under your feet at
night, made the tea for you when you were sick, followed you
to the gate when you left home the last time? Riches? What
would you take for that smiling, chirping baby? And wife?
She is the best wife, encourages you, meets you with a smile,
helps bear your burdens. Ah, that is love. That is life.
Here prosperity has its tap root!</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The proper rearing and training of our youth is an important 
essential. We begin to educate our children one hundred 
and twenty years before they are born. The sins of the

<span class="hr"> </span>

parents are visited upon the children unto the third and fourth
generations. Train carefully, drill constantly the chiild in the
path of rectitude, in its formative period, and when it is old,
it will not depart from the proper path.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There is a woeful neglect of our youth to-day. It is
amazing that any of our young people master the forces of
evil that would drag them down.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Luther Burbanks, the artisan of the vegetable world, by
tender, thoughtful care, year in and year out, has produced
the pomato from the potato and tomato; has made the rough,
thorny cactus, thornless and edible; has changed the character
of plants whose wretched odor has been offensive for six thousand 
years, into a perfume, the sweetest of the sweet. In
fact, from a lower order of plant life, by diligent care, he is
producing an order of nobility in the plant world. Do our
parents care thus for their children? A mother artist has a
tender flower upon her veranda. Three times a day she waters
it, nurses it, watches it. How she loves it! It blooms. She
calls in her neighbors. How they rejoice! But her own
darling son, blood of her blood, flesh of her flesh, within him
an immortal soul—does she care for him? Does she pray
with him three times a day? Does she till the soil in which
he grows ? Does she take him to Sunday-school and church
with her until he is twenty-one? Does she know where he is
on Sunday? And the daughter—I pity the Negro girl with
beautiful form and face. I must enter this field in auphemistic 
terms. Often without the watchful care of father or moth-

<span class="hr"> </span>

er she is hounded from pillar to post by demons. Notwithstanding 
her temptations, the average girl is permitted to go
about to parties, moonlight picnics, or excursions, church suppers, 
without father or mother, or chaperone. She is too often
kicked about like a foot-ball. To get our mothers and fathers
to hold tight rein upon their children, to regulate the relation
of our boys and girls and our young men and women, in fine,
to give a proper conception of what it means to rear children—
this is the mission of the scholar, the seer of the race. Unless
we rear our children properly in the home, put them in the
public schools, bring them into the folds of the Sunday-school
and the church, and keep them at profitable, honest labor of
some kind, on the farms, or in the shops, somewhere, anywhere, 
and hold them there until their character is hardened
in principles of duty and righteousness, sad, sad will be their
future. To do this is a task worthy of our best thought, our
best efforts. It involves the divorce question, the sanctity of
marriage ties. This is the main remedy for vagrancy and
criminality. Some say we need a better class of young people.
I say we need a better class of fathers and mothers. The
remedy is a matter of slow growth, of character building.
We must make better men and better women, and then we
shall have less criminality.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Our people should be taught their civic duties. We
should have pride in our city, county, state, nation. Every
question that affects the weal of our country should concern us.
We are a part of this government. Those who would make

<span class="hr"> </span>

us pariahs, aliens, outcasts, and disfranchise us are doomed
finally to failure. We are either citizens or not. If citizens,
we must ultimately be permitted to vote, and help elect our
rulers. Sin against any part of our legal citizens will rebound
on the sinner. If the Negro proves worthy the ballot, in self
defense, the dominant party will be compelled to permit him
to vote or else they should burn, up the Constitution of the
Nation. Taxation without representation is no better for the
white man than the Negro. If the Negro population is good
enough to be counted to determine the representation in our
National Congress, it is good enough to help choose that representation. 
This principle will yet win. Hypocrisy and double-dealing 
by the nation cannot live. Hence we look to the
future with a patriotic, abiding faith in our government, with
deep interest in good roads, deep water, purity of the ballot.
Every Negro should pay his taxes. He should be interested
in ail reform movements. He should hold at every possible
opportunity an unpurchasable ballot to be cast for the good of
his country.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In a recent local option campaign, it was said, "Let the
local optionists speak, sing and pray; we will carry the election. 
We can buy the niggers." Any man who will sell his
blood-stained ballot for any price whatever is not fit to vote,
and should be disfranchised. This doctrine should be preached
from every hill-top.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We should bear a man's share of the burden of government.   
We should help to make our government pure by first

<span class="hr"> </span>

being pure ourselves. Our influence should be ever against
the saloon, the king-devil of all evils, the worst enemy of the
human race.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Then our vision and interest should sweep out and take
in world movements. Whatever concerns mankind concerns
us. No man can grow large whose interest does not go beyond 
his own roof-tree. Trembling San Francisco, or starving 
China should find a place in our helpful sympathy. We
rise only as we lift others up. Love increases by loving. The
continent of Africa should be of deepest interest to every
thoughtful Negro. We need Africa as much as Africa needs
us. Africa is opportunity. It will be the storm center of the
great movements of the next century.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Rich in resources, romantic and mysterious, with every
possible climate, teeming with millions of human beings, the
coveted prize of every civilized nation, with railroads being
built from Cairo to the cape, with an ever widening commerce,
Africa offers to the young Negro lawyer, doctor, editor, educator, 
statesman, missionary, scientist, inventor, farmer, a career 
of greatest usefulness and fame. The inspiration of black
Livingstone in Africa is necessary to the manhood-growth of
the black man in America. What a thrilling mission have we
in Africa, in America, and Africa beyond the seas!</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Some two or three years ago the Iroquois Theatre burned
down in Chicago. A thousand men, women, and children sat
in this playhouse witnessing "Bluebeard." Suddenly flames
enveloped the interior of the building. The lives of nearly
seven hundred persons were suddenly scorched out. Their
charred remains were found sitting lifeless in their seats. Near
an exit sat a young man of eighteen summers, McLaughlin by
 
<span class="hr"> </span>

name, son of a missionary in South America. Rev. Frank
Gunsaulus was his uncle. He soon found his way out to safety, 
but his heart was pained by the piteous screams of mourning 
women and children. He rushed back and dragged to the
air and life a woman, then a child, then another, and another.
His hair was singed, his hands crisp, his clothes afire. Bystanders 
begged him not to go in any more. But he brought
to safety another and fell almost lifeless himself. He was
placed in an ambulance and hastened to a hospital where he
died within a few hours. Just before he died, he whispered
faintly: "Tell Uncle Frank Gunsaulus I died trying to save
others." Then again, more faintly still, "Tell Uncle Frank
Gunsaulus I died trying to save others."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Young men and women, prophets and priests of our race,
the fires of sin, of ignorance, of poverty, of thriftlessness, are
scorching out the lives of our people in the dark counties of
the Brazos, in the alleys of the cities, in America, beyond the
sea. You are divinely commissioned to rescue them, to go to
them, in the spirit of the Lowly One, to encourage them, to
show them a better way, to rejoice with them, to sorrow with
them, to give them, in working out a noble destiny, your life,
your all, and bequeath to posterity the noble sentiment—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"I died trying to save others."</p>
