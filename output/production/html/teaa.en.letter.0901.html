      <p class="tei_p">Hon. Wm. H. Seward,<br/>
Sec. of State U.S. of A.,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg leave most respectfully
to inform the Department of State, that the Reports
due from this office, of Dec 31st., 1862, together with
other documents, will be forwarded by the ship "M. C.
Stevens," of Baltimore, which sails hence shortly.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg also to ask, from the Department, some
instructions in reference to the mode of transmitting
Despatches &amp;c from this office. The usage has been to
send them exclusively by merchant vessels, which,
though a cheap, is an uncertain &amp; irregular way.
I have, to some extent, ventured to deviate from former
practice, but will, henceforth, follow the usage until
advised.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">My impression is that our interests will
be promoted by correspondence thro' an expeditious,
and regular route.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, with great Respect,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant,<br/>
Abraham Hanson,<br/>
U.S. Coml. Agent.</p>
