June 17th 1879</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon F. W. Seward<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg to inform the Department 
that my attention has been called 
to an article in the London Times, May 
23rd, stateing that the President has 
seen fit to appoint one of the Clerks 
of an American house at this port. (a 
Mr Lewis) U.S. Consul &amp;c. I am not surprise 
at the appointment of Mr Lewis; as 
I am quite aware of the repeated 
Efforts made by him &amp; his friends to procure
his Appointment by writing gross falsehoods 
to the Department detremental to 
me, as was shown in a dispatch from 
the war department to Commodore Shufeldt 
requesting him to investigate the 
same on his arrival here, at which 
investigation



said charges were proven to be false; 
but I am surprise to know that 
a Government as great as the United 
States would remove an Officer from 
his post by appointing another, without 
a charge or sufficient known cause 
Common courtesy at lease, I think, is due 
a servant of any Government let him
be black or white.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
Jno. A. Parm M.D.</p>
