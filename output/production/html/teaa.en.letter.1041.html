      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to refer
you to my despatch No. 29
dated 29th of Sept. 1886. of
which I had before
written for compensation
for service rendered the 
late Minister Resident
and Consul General
Moses A. Hopkins prior to
his death.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I attended upon him
during his illness–I
was

<span class="hr"> </span>

was the writter of his Invoices
when he was unabled to
write. I performed the
duties of this Consulate
General before the Department
of State gave me power to act
according to the Consular
Regulations; therefore I
feel I should be compensated 
for part of the quarter
ending June 30, 1886 and
also for the month of July
for service rendered the
United States Government,
I do not wish to be
unreasonable nor do I wish to
receive payment for
service not justly
rendered

<span class="hr"> </span>

rendered; but I am
sure if the late Minister
Moses A. Hopkins had
have lived I would
have received my pay.
I want to do what is
right and just.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I submit the above for
your consideration and 
will be willing to abide
by what you think is
just.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>

U.S. Vice Consul Genl
at Monrovia, La.</p>
