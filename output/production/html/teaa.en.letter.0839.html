      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the
honor to write you regarding
many new articles of American
Manufacture which have been
imported from the United States
to this place by the American
House of Yates and Porterfield
during the past year.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">These articles find a ready sale
many of them being superior to
other make and are sought
after in preference.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">American Axes, Hatchets,
Hammers, Saws, Hoes, Chissels
Augers &amp; Bits Cooking Stoves
Kerosene Oil Stoves, Nails,
Safes, Sewing Machines

<span class="hr"> </span>

and Hardware generally
Roofing Slates. other countries
cannot compete either in quality
or price. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Powder[?]</span> being put
up in handsome varnished kegs
is superior in appearance
and strength. The only objection
urged against American <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Powder[?]</span>
is, it is not put in 4lb Kegs
as well as 5lb, and dealers claim
that a 4lb keg will sell for the
same as a 5lb keg, hence
the advantage of other packages
as against the American
The same objection is urged
against American Calcoes
and Cotton goods. The English
cottons are put up in pieces
of 12 and 20 yds and sell for
so much the piece whereas the
American Cottons as a rule
are in pieces ranging from
40 to 50 yards.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">12 yards  of cloth cut off a
large piece is not as good

<span class="hr"> </span>

for this market, as a piece
regularly made up containing
just 12 yards. This seems
like a very slight affair, but
it is a most serious objection
in the way of an easy introduction
of American cottons.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">All the Pine Lumber used in
the Colony is imported from the
United States</p>

      <p class="tei_p">American Trunks (cheap grade)

increasing sale.</p>
