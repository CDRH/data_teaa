4th March 1867.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Herewith I have the honor to
transmit the return of the arrivals and 
Departures of American Vessels and
the statement of Fees for the half year
ending the 31st December 1866.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Fees, never a large item here,
have considerably fallen off since the 
Rebellion of the Southern States in
consequence of the bulk of the American 
Trade having since that period been
carried on under the English Flag.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For the last half year the total
is only $20.23 Â½ a sum insufficient 
even to pay a Man to attend to the 
Flag &amp; Flag Staff.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">By the return of Imports and Exports
herewith enclosed you will see that the

&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<br/>

trade between this port &amp; the United States
has considerably increased tho' with much 
fluctuation.</p> 
    
      <p class="tei_p">I have not yet received the public
acts for the 39th Congress and am therefore
unacquainted with its provisions or into
allowance if any has been made as
compensation for services at this consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Office of the consulate is held at my
own House which is rated at Twelve Hundred
&amp; fifty Dollars per annum and would
readily let a Fifteen Hundred dollars
I respectfully crave to be allowed Two
Hundred and Fifty Dollars per annum
for Rent of Offices</p>
 
      <p class="tei_p">I crave reference to my letter of the 
20th November last renewing application 
for a New Seal and I now further
make requisition for a large Flag to hoist 
at the Flag staff as also a small Boat
Flag.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most obedient Servant<br/>
