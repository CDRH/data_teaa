      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States, Goree-Dakar<br/>
June 1st, 1898.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable J. B. Moore<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir: I have the honor to report that
the three-masted Sch H. E. Thomsen,
which cleared for this port from Boston,
April 16th before war was declared
with Spain, arrived here duly and is 
discharging her cargo at Dakar.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Under ordinary conditions this vessel
would leave here for the West Indies
seeking freight, but on account of
the war with Spain the Captain thinks
he shall try and make his way
back to some northern port of the 
United States in ballast, and he expects
to sail in the course of a week.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Spanish gunboats not infrequently
call at Dakar on their way up and
down this coast, and I have advised
the Master of the H. E. Thomson that he
will do well to leave the coast



just at night, so as to gain an
offing of 70 or 80 miles before daylight
the next morning, then to pass
about 75 miles south of the Cape
de Verde Islands so as not to be
becalmed or reported in passing
them, and when well to the 
Westward of those Islands to shape
his course more than a hundred
miles East of Bermuda in order
to cross the track between Spain
and the Antilles as nearly as
possible at right angles. Such
a course would certainly minimize 
his risk, and I think the 
chances are in favor of the
vessels reaching the United States in
safety</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
Very truly Yours<br/>
Peter Strickland<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
