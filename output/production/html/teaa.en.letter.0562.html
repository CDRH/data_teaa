W C of Africa<br/>
22d December 1857</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I purpose showing your Excellency that the 
commerce of the United States with this place &amp; the
welfare of American citizens require the establishment
of an American Consulate at this port.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">During the year about to end there have been Thirty one
American vessels here &amp; many <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> sharing the need 
of some one to care for &amp; empowered to protect
American interests.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Seamen have been discharged from their ships against
their will &amp; without their 3 months advance, have sickened
&amp; died, &amp; once have been left behind in the Colonial 
Hospitals &amp; upon their recovery have ascertained that 
their ship had left &amp; in one case taking away the 
clothes of the seaman.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A case has thus come under my <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>. A Mr Lee
2d Mate of the Bark Turk of Salem Mass was
discharged from his vessel without his 3 months wages.
Came to me in distress. I gave him employment.
it was during the sickly season. he was soon taken
ill with the African fever. I obtained lodging for 
him, sent my own Doctor to treat him (whose Bill
I now enclose hoping that I may be reimbursed)
upon his recovery there being no American vessels
here I obtained a passage for him to London.</p>

      <span class="hr">Â </span>
    
      <p class="tei_p">A petition in my favor signed by most of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">African[?]</span>
merchants of New York &amp; many other private 
influential persons has already been filed in
the Department of State praying for the establishment 
of a Consulate here. The late Commander
in Chief of the Squadron Commodore <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Crable[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">was[?]</span> 
quite aware of the necessity of a Consulate &amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
me that he has communicated with your Excellency
relative thereto &amp; has recommended me for that 
post.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> that your Excellency will deign to give
your attention to this matter.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am<br/> 
Your Excellency's<br/> 
Most Obdt. &amp; humble Servant<br/>
Danl R. B. Upton</p>

      <span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">To His Excellency<br/> 
The Honorable Lewis Cass<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
