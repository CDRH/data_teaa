      <p class="tei_p">Hon. Jas. D. Porter</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
inform you, that owing to the
irregularity of steamers plying
along the West Coast of Africa,
calling at Monrovia, that I am just
in receipt of your No 5, dated July
11th 1887. The surf is often so very
bad, at this place that the captains
of steamers with mail, for Monrovia
are forced to go on to Bassa. Mails
left at Monrovia's next town Bassa
is just as long getting back to
Monrovia as it would take to receive
mail from England. I have the honor
to inform you, that your No 2, has
never reached Monrovia. I have
this day informed Mr S. S. Sevier
of the contents of your No 5. as well
as of the contents of the Comptroller
of the treasury department's communication

<span class="hr"> </span>

dated June 23rd received here,
August 13th A period of nearly three
months in transit. Mr Sevier is
not a citizen of the United States
he is an African native, an
American negro being his father.
He holds land in the Republic of
Liberia which no nonresident
is allowed to do. He is a full citizen
here exercising the right of suffrage
at such election where present in
this country. He is now in the
United States on a visit, and informed
me that his post office address
is Hampton Va. Be pleased to 
inform the Comptroller, of the
Treasury Department, that Mr Sevier ceased
to be U.S. Vice Consul Gen'l on
June 6th last past. With renewed
assurances of my high esteem
for your consideration,<br/>
I am, Sir, your obt. servt<br/>
Chas. H. J. Taylor</p>
