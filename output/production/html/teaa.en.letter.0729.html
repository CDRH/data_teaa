      <div class="note">No. 16</div>

      <p class="tei_p">US Consulate, Goree-Dakar.<br/>
October 22ond 1884.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable John Davis<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By last mail I received a
Circular dated August 21st, 1884,
requesting information with a 
view to the reorganisation of the 
Consular service. I will then 
as briefly as may be, and of 
necessity in round roughly
estimated numbers, give you 
as graphic an idea as I can 
of French Senegal, its commercial
facilities and its possibilities.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Geographically,
French Senegal extends from 
the "Great Desert" to near Sierra
Leone, embracing a section of
Coast about six hundred
miles in length, for the most
    


part extremely fertile, and 
abounding with navigable
Rivers which render access
to the interior comparatively
cheap and easy. Of these
the Senegal River is navigable
for 600 miles during half of the 
year, and is being connected
with the Niger by a Railroad
from Bafoulabe to Bammakou
which will give it the trade
of the whole upper Niger valley.
The other Rivers of importance
are the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Salvum[?]</span>, the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Cosamanza[?]</span>
the Cassini, the Nunez, the Ponga,
the Debreeka, and the Mellacoree;
all navigable for distances
ranging from 10 to 150 miles.
Sandwiched between the French 
sections of Coast are some
English Settlements confined
closely to the banks of the Gambia,
which is a magnificent River
navigable for 400 miles, and 
some Portuguese settlements about

<span class="hr"> </span>

Bulama, where there are also 
three fine Rivers each navigable
far more than a hundred miles.
The Commerce of both the English 
and Portuguese possessions is 
essentially under French control,
and Goree-Dakar from its central
position and accessibility to mail
steamers is the Commercial
emporium of the whole coast.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Of Cities &amp; towns.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">St. Louis, built in handsome 
European style on an island in
the Senegal River, is the capitol,
with a large commerce, and 
contains with its <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">environs[?]</span> about 
30,000 inhabitants. Goree-Dakar
with their <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">environs[?]</span>, including 
Rufisk in sight on the Goree
Bay, contain fully 25000
inhabitants, and there are 
numerous towns further South
in French Senegal which 
contain from one to five
thousand inhabitants, all
    


doing a thriving trade with 
Goree, (which is a free port)
by means of Coasters ranging
from 10 to 150 tons, many of
them timbered with mahogany
and rosewood which abounds
at different places on the Coast.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The magnificent Bay of
Goree is 20 miles across from
East to West and from 3
to five miles deep, forming 
one of the safest and most
capacious harbors in the world.
It contains no detached dangers
of consequence, the navigation
being clean in all parts at 
the distance of a mile 
from the shore; and in it 
no lasting gale even blows.
Of its present commerce &amp;
have no statistics at hand
from which to infer the
amount, but have seen,
exclusive of war vessels



of which there are almost 
always a number in port,
more than ten thousands tons
of shipping in the Bay at 
one time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A Railroad</p>

      <p class="tei_p">was begun from Dakar last
year, and trains are now 
running over it into the 
interior upwards of 30 miles,
and it is designed next
year to have it extended
as far as St. Louis, more than 
a hundred miles. A telegraph
already connects the two places,
which is to connect by
Cable next year to the 
Canaries, and from thence
to Europe.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Mails</p>

      <p class="tei_p">to Europe are carried by
the Steamers of the Messageries
&amp; Maritime Company, which 
are from three to four 
thousands tons each, and
    
    
    
in going and coming call at
Goree four times a month.
In addition to these we have 
a boat from the English line 
of steamers once a month, and 
one from a Hamburgh line 
of steamers once a month,
besides several belonging
to merchants which sometimes
carry the mails but do not
make their trips regularly.</p>  

      <p class="tei_p">Amount of American Trade</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Amount of American
Goods at present consumed
yearly in French Senegal
cannot amount to less than 
one Million dollars in value,
but of this only about one 
fifth part is brought here
by Americans, who have been
steadily driven off by competition
because the conditions of the 
trade are against them.
French agents in Boston
and New York buy such
    


Goods only as can be obtained
in the most reasonable terms in America,
and either ship them direct
mostly in foreign vessels which 
afterwards load Groundnuts
for Europe or else they ship
them to Europe by steam
from whence they are brought
down here in vessels which 
carry on the Trade regularly.
Owing to this state of affairs,
which in my opinion might
easily be prevented, our direct
commerce is not holding its
own in this one of the
fairest prospective markets
in the world; there being 
not less than 3,000,000 of 
natives here now fairly under
French jurisdiction, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">with[?]</span> 
wants which Americans
can supply better than 
others increasing in almost 
a Geometrical ratio, and good
produce to exchange for goods.

<span class="hr"> </span>

But I hope to explain 
fully about this in the 
near future, and will
now end by stating that
with the present depressing 
influences there will not
probably be exported directly
to America from Goree-Dakar 
more than $60,000 in Produce.
It will consist of Hides, Gum 
Copal and India Rubber,
and much of the same kinds
of produce which go from
here to Europe will finally 
reach America to pay for 
goods which French agents
buy and ship from there.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The foregoing remarks
I hope will serve to give 
the Government a sufficient
idea of the importance of
this place in reorganising the
Counsular service, but there
is much that would perhaps 
be more interesting to be


    
added as soon as some 
statistics will be available
at the conclusion of the current 
quarter. In brief it seems
to me that Goree-Dakar is 
one of the most important
places between Cape Spartel
and that of Good Hope.
Only that it has a somewhat
unsavory reputation on account 
of epidemics Dakar would soon
rival St. Vicente as a coaling 
station for steamers, and as 
things are it does a good 
deal of that business. There 
is unfortunately no question
but what the Coast of Africa
is unhealthy for Europeans, but 
Goree-Dakar is one of the 
best places an it in that
respect, probably the very 
best place.</p>   
    
      <p class="tei_p">Of Governors, Senegal has
for a long time had Faidherbe
one of the most distinguished
    
    
   
of her Generals and more 
recently Briere d' l'Isle, at
present high in command
in Tonquin. How the Colony 
would relish the American 
representation here changed
back to a Vice Consulate
as seems to be proposed I 
can only guess from a long
knowledge of the French 
Character, but I presume I 
shall not do wrong in
suggesting that I think such 
a measure would be hardly 
favorable to American interests
here, and perhaps cause whoever
held the position to be treated
with a frigid <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">politician[?]</span> by 
the Officials which might be
far from agreeable.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir with respect<br/>
Very truly Yours<br/>
Peter Strickland<br/>
US Consul</p>
