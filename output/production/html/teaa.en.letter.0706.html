      <p class="tei_p">Your Excellency,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour to forward
Your Excellency copies of despatches,
respectively addressed, to the Prime
Minister of Madagascar &amp; myself
to His Excellency the French Minister
for Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As Ambassador of H.M. the

The President of the United States

&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

Treaty Powers, it is clearly my duty
to those Powers &amp; to Her Majesty,
in view of the past &amp; present <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">time[?]</span> 
of policy pursued by the Government 
of the French Republic in
reference to Madagascar, &amp; the 
attitude of protection it has 
assumed over our independent
Sovereign State, to take this immediate 
occasion to adopt the 
peremptory measure of acquainting 
the Powers, that no Protectorate
of any kind whatever, has ever  
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

been ceded to France by the Queen 
of Madagascar or Her Government, 
&amp;, as my despatch to
M. de Freycinet confirms, &amp; rather
than acknowledge the Protectorate
claimed by France, Her Majesty's
Government will advise Her
Majesty to appeal to the nation 
whether he shall, or, not
resort again to the arbitrament
of arms.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I make no comment  
  
<span class="hr"> </span>

upon the conduct of the Government 
of the French Republic, or reflection 
upon its policy. I 
state, without hesitation, the
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">unalterable[?]</span> resolve of Madagascar 
not to allow the internal 
administration of her
Kingdom to be interfered with.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I may, however, benefit explain 
that the ratification of
the Treaty of Peace of 17th
December, 1885, (a printed

<span class="hr"> </span>

copy of which I now submit)
was made absolutely dependent upon 
the receipt beforehand of the 
explanatory letter (in the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">nature[?]</span> 
of a protocol) of the Representatives 
for the French Republic,
as <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">the[?]</span> examination of the 
dates &amp; circumstances will
incontestably prove. Of course
if the French Government repudiate
the letter &amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">postscript[?]</span>
of their Representative, upon the    
    
<span class="hr"> </span>    

faith of which the Treaty was <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">concluded[?]</span>,
the Malagasy Government, on the other 
hand, have the right to look upon
the Treaty as null &amp; void.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Government of the French
Republic is in the singular
position of putting upon a Treaty
a construction opposed to that 
which her own Plenipotentiaries
have placed on record as
conveying the precise meaning 
of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">text[?]</span>. The letter of the

<span class="hr"> </span>

Representatives for the French Republic 
is in the nature of a Protocol &amp; must
be held to conclusively settle the
meaning of the Treaty.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Finally, I leave it to the world at
large to decide, whether, when the two 
letters—namely—the letter now called
the Appendix to Her Treaty, handed <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> by
the French Representatives to me, as the
Malagasy Plenipotentiary, &amp; my exchange
letter, or Convention, given to them—
are compared, whether, I repeat it, the

<span class="hr"> </span>

last named letter, ie, the Secret
Treaty, is not more than a
fair quid pro quo for the
former.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your Excellency</p>
      <p class="tei_p">France &amp; Madagascar
are at serious variance respecting
the interpretation of the Treaty of Peace
of the 17th December 1885 &amp; its Appendix
dated 9th of January 1886.
This Treaty, Your Excellency is
quite cognizant, was ratified
by myself, on behalf of the Queen
of Madagascar, on the 10th of January
1886, having previously received
as the sole condition of my ratification
the letter of interpretation or Appendix
dated 9th of January 1886 &amp; signed

by the Represenatives for the French
Republic. Notwithstanding the
self congratulations of the French
Press, that the Prime Minister of
Madagascar had succumbed to the
pressure brought to bear upon him
by France—to which I give an 
unqualified denial. I regret that
I am constrained to inform you
that the differences alluded to are
bound to endure whilst France
deems it fit to pursue, through
her Agents in Madagascar, a
policy of bewilderment, &amp; to treat
the Queens Envoy in Europe &amp; the
bearer of gifts to the President of the 
French Republic in a temporizing
manner. A policy of inactivity
lacking, as it does, clearness &amp;

<span class="hr"> </span>

resolution, will neither <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>

         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> the difficulty.
I have visited France to confer
with your Excellency, &amp; to come to a
friendly understanding. When
prepared as <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>, &amp; am now to
look the difficulties straight in the
face, &amp; if possible, to overcome them
I have met with nothing but
want of resolution on the part of the
French Cabinet.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">By the last mail the Prime
Minister of Madagascar sent me
an open letter addressed to Your
Excellency, but has left it to me
as the Malagasy Ambassador
to use my discretion in forwarding
it to its destination. It is the 
latest, &amp; most emphatic expression
of the

<span class="hr"> </span>

of the unalterable opinion of the
Queen &amp; Her Government. It is
briefly to this effect. The Queen
will not allow any interference
on the part of the French Agent, in the
internal administration of the
Kingdom of Madagascar, in 
such points as raising <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>
to leasing of Customs dues &amp;c &amp;c
&amp; rather than admit such interference
will <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">again[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">go[?]</span> to the nation to 
ascertain the national will. What
the issue of such action will be
I prefer to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> to the surmise of
Your Excellency <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_or tei_unclear_extent_three tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[unclear, two or three words]</span>
is that hostilities will be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">recommended[?]</span>
&amp; when Your Excellency considers
that Madagascar is not in the
same position that she was before
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the late war but that her rational
power, &amp; defensive resources are
greatly superior, the conflict, which
appears to me imminent, will be 
long uncertain costly, &amp; sanguinary
were it not the friend of France
that I have always professed to be
I should not now be hastening to
discover to you the real state of
diplomatic relations.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Having warned Your Excellency 
I now adjure you, in the interests
of civilization, for the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">bonds[?]</span> of France
to pause before unsheathing the
sword &amp; pointing it at the breast
of a nation that has already
sacrificed so much, &amp; whose desire
it is to fulfil to the letter, on her side
the obligations of the Treaty which
she has entered into with French
I shall

I shall be prefered to call on

      <p class="tei_p">On board the Naïade.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Tamatave, Jan. 9, 1886.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Monsieur le Plenipotentiaire,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In compliance with the desire which you have
been good enough to express, and in order to remove
the doubts manifested by the Malagasy Government
relative to the interpretation of certain expressions
of the text of the Treaty of the 17th of December
1885, we are willing by consent to furnish you with
the following explanations:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">His Excellency the Prime Minister has ordered
you to define the meaning of paragraph 1, of Article 
II of the Treaty, which says:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"A Resident representing the Government of the
Republic will preside over the foreign relations."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">This means that the Resident will have the right
to interfere in matters having the character of foreign
politics; that he will have he right, for instance, to
oppose any cession of territory to any foreign nation
whatever; any Military and Naval establishments;
or the allowing of any assistance, in men or vessels,
asked for by the Government of the Queen of 
Madagascar, being granted without the consent of the
French Government.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No Treaty, Agreement, or Convention can be
made without the approval of the French Government.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">By Article III. of the Treaty it is stipulated that
the "Resident will reside at Antananarivo with a
military escort."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Prime Minister wishes to know what we mean
by <em class="hi">military escort</em>. We consent to state that "escort"
does not mean "corps d'armée;" and to define
more precisely, we engage that this escort shall not
exceed 50 men, cavalry or infantry. This escort will
not enter into the interior of the Palace.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">In Article VI. the expression "lease by <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">emphy[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">ansis[?]</span>" means a special lease for 99 years, renewable
at the will of the parties.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In paragraph 3 of the same article stipulating that
French citizens will be able to choose freely and
take into their service in any capacity whatever any
Malagasy <em class="hi">not bound by a previous engagement</em>, we have
necessarily meant to exclude soldiers and slaves, since
soldiers and slaves have, more than any one else,
engaged their persons.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We think that the Government of Her Majesty
the Queen have not to complain of this omission. It
was conceived in a feeling of kindness for Her, for
we thought it preferable that such expressions
should not figure in the text of a Treaty of this 
importance.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In the same manner the clause by virtue of which
"the Goverment of the Queen of Madagascar undertakes
to pay the sum of ten millions of francs to be
applied equally to the settlement of the French
claims liquidated previous to the conflict between
the two parties, and to the reparation of any damage
caused to foreigners by the said conflict,"—we meant
the damages caused before and during the war up to
the day of signing of the Treaty of peace.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Government of the Republic will evidently 
not lend its assistance to the Queen of Madagascar
for the defence of Her dominions, unless such
assistance is asked for by Her Majesty the Queen.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">With regard to the meaning of Article XV. it 
appears to us sufficiently clear and precise to necessitate
any further comment. The advantages which
it stipulates in favour of the Government of Her 
Majesty the Queen are evident, as it will be easy to
prove to the Prime Minister when we go to the 
Capital.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">With regard to the territory necessary for the 
operations which the Government of the Republic 
will carry on at its convenience, in the Bay of Diego
Suarez, we believe we are able to assert that it will
not exceed a mile and a half on the entire south of 
the Bay, as well as around the east and west, and
four miles round the north outline of the bay,
starting from the most extreme northerly point of
said bay.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is superfluous to add that at Diego Suarez the
French authorities will not afford refuge to Malagasy
subjects in a state of desertion or who cannot
produce a passport from the Malagasy authorities.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In fact in the carying out of the full, general, and
plenary amnesty, and the removal of the sequestration
placed upon the property of the respective
subjects of the two contracting parties, the Government
of Her Majesty the Queen will be inspired by
the same feelings of loyalty and justice which we
have a right to expect from the experience and
enlightened mind of His Excellency the Prime
Minister.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Accept, Monsieur le Plenipotentiare, the assurance
of our high esteem.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(Signed) S. Patrimonio, Minister Plenipotentiary.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(Signed) E. Miot. Vice Admiral, Commander in Chief.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">P.S. You have asked us whether the Queen's 
Government may, as heretofore, continue to negotiate
Commercial Treaties with foreign powers.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Undoubtedly, as far as such. Commercial Treaties
are not contrary to the stipulations of thee treaty of
the 17th December 1885.</p>
