<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Within the pages of <em>The Crisis</em> is the picture labeled "Official Garden Party, Freetown, Sierra Leone." Its provenance is unknown, but it is an interesting representation of colonial society in the colony of Sierra Leone, and one that would have interested African Americans in 1912. The "Garden Party," was a tradition begun by Queen Victoria in the 1860s. Rooted in the Royal family, it was an elite and exclusive function, reserved for royals and the upper classes. By the twentieth century, it became a pastime of other classes in British society, one which clearly spread across the British empire. Garden parties were organized in British colonies, and though largely reserved for European guests, in this case invitations were extended to Sierra Leonean "subjects" of the British Crown. The "Africans" in this picture were most likely Creoles, product of British humanitarian enterprise in Sierra Leone. The ladies are in Victorian dress, with seating of European women on one side and Black women on the other side of what appears to be the colony's governor, Edward Marsh Merewether. The Sierra Leoneans in this picture were likely those employed in the civil service, where in 1912, 15 out of 92 positions were held by Africans.</p> 

<p>While the photo has no annotation beyond its title and does not accompany an article, it follows news on "Africa," which featured the exclusion of mixed children from white schools in South Africa, news of Eritrean troops in Tripoli, as well as articles on Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. For African Americans, this visual would have been interesting, showing a population of African descent very much like them. The many stereotypes and negative representations of Africa presented to African Americans often portrayed them as uncivilized, needing uplift. This image belies that characterization and provides an opportunity for the African American readers of <em>The Crisis</em> to see another view of Black people on the African continent at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
