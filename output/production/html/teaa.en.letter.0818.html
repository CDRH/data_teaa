St. Paul de Loanda<br/>
November 14th 1887</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hon James D. Porter.<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to call the
attention of the Department to the fact that
that this Consular District extends from
Ambriz in 7° 49' S. Lat., to Cape Frio 18°
20' S. Lat, and from 13° E. Long. to 18° E Long.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">By referring to dispatch No.
13., having same date as this, it will be
seen that the commercial nations of Europe
consider that this country is worthy of attention.
Confident of its future they are investing 
large sums in opening the interior in
internal improvements, and in the cultivation
of its trade.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Whether it would be advantageous 
to the United States for it to become
actively interested in this trade is a 
question

<span class="hr"> </span>

to be decided by its merchants, but before
they can so decide, it is necessary that
they should be thoroughly advised as to
the nature of the trade and the many
causes affecting it, for now to them, it is,
in a commercial sense, almost an unknown
land.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The object of the Government in 
sustaining a Consulate here is, I judge, to
advance the commercial interests of its country.
That this can be done under the present arrangement 
of things, it seems to me, is doubtful;
unless information is given which will influence
commercial action, the problems, as
to whether this trade should be cultivated by
our merchants, will long remain unsolved.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">A residence of many years in
Africa has taught me that, to speak advisedly
and correctly of its trade, it is not well
to confide in the statements of merchants
and traders who desirous of presenting opposition,
have no hesitation in using as a means
to that end, falsehoods but it is necessary that
that knowledge should be gained which is to 
be had only by personal examination.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The

<span class="hr"> </span>

The difference in the habits, customs
and language of the natives of districts seperated
from one another by only a few miles, while
great, are not more pronounced than those which
are to be found in the lower animal life, the
flora, the vegatation and the physical conformation 
of the country. for instance, the
natives of one district superstitiously refuse to
gather certain products, yet the tribe adjoining
them use the same product as their principal
article of trade, that one class of vegatation is
not common to the country is evidenced by
the fact that in certain districts nothing grows
but that giant of the forest, the "Baobab,"
from which is taken a fibre known to commerce
as "Andasonia."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I hope that the Department will
concur with me in thinking that this Consulate
would be useful if it should become actively
engaged in collecting such information as
would enable the Department to consider with
the merchants of our country, those questions which
would determine the value of this trade with the
United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">This cannot be done by a quiet resi-
dence

<span class="hr"> </span>

dence in Loanda, for the
people, the customs of the natives,
the vegatation and the trade
should be made a study at
their homes and at the places 
of supply.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am aware of the great
amount of labor contained in
in the undertaking of this work,
as well as I am of the danger
which environs it because of
exposure and hostile natives,
but being to an extent familiar
with the general characteristics
of these people, and being more
or less inured to the unhealthy
climate. I have no hesitation in
saying that I feel that I am
fitted to enter into this work with
confidence in my capacity to
bring it to a successful conclusion; 
therefore, I have the
honor to respectfully request
that the Department will
issue such instructions, and 
make

<span class="hr"> </span>

make such an allowance as will enable
me to proceed with this endeavor.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In seeking this employment
I am influenced by the hope of being
able to make such a report as will
be of value in the eyes of our citizens
interested in commerce, and of
earning for myself the commendation 
of the Department.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Henry F. Downing<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
