      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to report
to the Department that Domestic
Slavery, which has existed here for
so long under the name of the liberto
system; finishes here on the 17th July
in accordance with the Decree published
12 months ago in the Bulletin Official
of this Province.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Portuguese Government
published a Royal Decree in the "Diario
do Governo" of 24 December 1875 making
<span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_or tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_lines tei_gap_reason_incomplete tei_gap_reason_image tei_gap">[illegible]</span>



certain arrangements for free labour
for the future, which appears to me
to imitate very much the Coolie system
in use in India by which the planters
of tea &amp; indigo in Assam and the
Northern provinces of India are supplied 
with labour and there is no 
doubt if the regulations set down in
the Decree could be carried out here, 
that great benefits would arise to
the whole Province, but unfortunately
I have no confidence that such will
be the case.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Several of the larger planters
in the Cazengo District, with
which I am best acquainted, have 
to a certain extent prepared their 
slaves by giving them their freedom
and



and allowing them so many days of 
the week for their own use, so that they
can cultivate a piece of land for themselves,
and as far as I can learn they 
seem perfectly satisfied and the
Planters are not likely to suffer much
in this part of the Province.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the Island of St. 
Thomas, the case is very different;
the wealth of that part of the Province
consists entirely of coffee plantations
which have been worked on the Liberto
system or in plain words by slaves
exported from Loanda and other parts.
There, great discontent exists and
the slaves who are not natives of the 
Island are not so easily dealt with
They have lately nearly all left the 
plantations



plantations and refused to work,
so that the planters have been obliged
to get Krooboys from Cape Palmas
and other parts of the Coast. Nearly
every English steamer has taken
a large number of Krooboys to the
Islands, who go there on contracts for
18 months and 2 years. No doubt the 
Krooboys will do well, but I am
afraid that sufficient attention
will not be given to their contracts, 
so that they are sent home when
they finish their time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The native slaves of the
Province are naturally of a most
careless and indolent disposition,
and few will work unless compelled
to do so by fear of punishment
They



They consider Domestic Slavery
no disgrace, but rather the contrary
especially when owned by a good
master. I have known of instances
where to keep them in order they have
been threatened to be sent to the Government
office to be made free, which
has had quite the desired effect. No doubt
this is the want of education, which up
to the present has not been attended
to in any way whatever.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As regards the actual and total
abolition of slavery throughout the Province,
I believe it to be for the moment impossible,
as the principal wealth of the "Sobas"
or Native Chiefs consists in the number
of slaves they posses and the Portuguese
Government have not sufficient power
or



or influence to make them resign
what they consider their lawful
property and the idea of a forced
indemnification would not be
listened to, as they would have no
confidence in such an offer, even
if they could understand it.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Often the slaves that are
brought in for sale are the children
of some one that has committed
some small crime for which the 
family are condemned to death 
or to be sold so that in such a 
case it is a charity to buy them
I am happy to say that, as far 
as my experience goes the greater
part of the slaves in this part
of the Province, are well treated
which



which no doubt is for the owner's
interest.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When the Decree comes
into force I will inform the Department 
further as to the effect
of the same</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
Vice Commercial Agent</p>
