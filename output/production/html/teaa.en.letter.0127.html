25 January 1881</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to report the 
arrival here on the 3rd January 
of the Whaler "Platina" of New
Bedford, she having been obliged to 
put into port as the crew refused
to continue in the vessel they
having shipped for 18 months and
the time having expired, and the
captain wishing them to continue
the voyage for 18 months longer.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I tried to induce them to 
reship in the vessel, as they had
no complaints of importance to make
against the officers, and also as this 
is the most unhealthy season here
I was anxious not to hand the men
as it is so difficult to get them
shipped from the port to Europe.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">However my reasoning had
no effect, and I had to discharge
the following, taking the usual
three



three months extra wages:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Daniel <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Leter[?]</span>, who was a Deserter
from the "Clarisse", and did not belong
to the crew of the "Platina"; and was
picked up at Cabinda </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Eight of these men I shipped
in the "Benin" for Havre or Liverpool,
and 6 by Portuguese Steamer "Bengo"
for Lisbon. For the former I had
to pay $389.00 passage money; &amp; Â£30
gratification to the Portuguese
Captain of the "Bengo", all of which I
will account for in my Quarterly
a/c of the Relief fund.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I obtained 12 natives (Cabindas)
to ship for 18 Months which made
up the compliment of the crew
required for the vessel again to put
to



to sea These men are shipped on
the conditions that when the time
of 18 Months expires they are to be
landed either here or at Ambriz</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This is the first time that
the Natives have shipped from this
port in a Whaler &amp; should they
return satisfied I am certain there
will be little difficulty in getting
sailors for any other vessels of the 
same class that may come here
requiring a crew.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Captain of the "Platina"
was exceedingly pleased with this
port as fresh provisions can always 
be obtained in abundance and at 
reasonable rates; &amp; the only obstacle
that prevented the Whalers from
coming here, he thought was the
port changes &amp; formalities required by
the Custom House.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I think it would be of
great advantage to the Whalers to
come here instead of going to Cabinda,
I have made application to His
Excellency



Excellency the Governor General to
obtain a reduction of the usual
dues levied on Whaling Vessels and
also to allow the oil to be shipped
free of any export duty should they
wish to send it home from this port.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As soon as I get a reply I will
advise the Department</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/> 
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant,<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
Vice-Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
