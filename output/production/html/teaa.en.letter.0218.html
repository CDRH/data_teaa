17th December 1858</p>

Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have to acknowledge the receipt 
of your communication of the 25th October 
last, and in reply thereto beg to enclose 
herewith a correct statement of what were the 
facts with regard to the bill stated by the Mr 
J. B. Danforth to have been sold to me. I 
have had to call attention in it to certain 
points necessary to be examined into, and 
I trust that the statement I forward and 
what may result from an investigation in 
the points alluded to, will satisfy you of the
straitforwardness and fairness of my conduct
in the business, and that Mr Danforth has 
been guilty of great misrepresentation. I should  
wish to forbear any remark upon this 
gentleman not necessary to my own vindication, 
but it seems not to be doubted that he  
has been guilty of great misconduct, which  
will doubtless, not be lost sight of; and 
what he has done as regards myself is, in 
fact, an endeavour to excuse that misconduct  
which

<span class="hr"> </span>

which seems to have been of such a character 
as to be wholly inexcusable, but untruly 
suggesting that it was prompted by another 
I should wish, independent of the more 
direct evidence, that it may be considered 
whether the account given by Mr Danforth 
is even probable, and particularly whether a 
person who, according to his own statement, 
was ready to accede at once to an act of 
fraud whom the prompting of another, was 
likely to want a prompter.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Trusting, as I have said, that you will 
be satisfied that the part I have acted in 
this business a been an honorable one, and 
that I may regard the latter part of your 
letter as importing that your being satisfied 
to that effect, would be followed by my 
appointment being made, I beg now again 
respectfully to urge and claims. I have been 
Acting Consul at this place since 1853, and 
although I have performed the duties of the 
office in a manner to give satisfaction, I 
believe, to all connected with the United States 
who have been here, as I believe those connected 
with the states who are here would be most 
willing to testify by the signing of any 
document which might be necessary for the 
purpose (though not feeling sure that a 
document of that nature would be proper to be

<span class="hr"> </span>

sought, I have not endeavoured to obtain one) 
and have so managed with regard to distressed 
American Seamen as to have to send home only 
two at the expense of the Government, having 
with regard to a great number of others both 
relieved them, and managed to ship them 
in vessels, without their costing the Government 
any thing; and although I have 
necessarily had to incur expense to enable 
me to carry on the duties of the Consulate, 
yet to this time I have received no salary. 
I cannot but feel this to be hard, and 
earnestly beg that my appointment may now 
be made and forwarded to me, that I may 
be placed upon a different footing in future. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Very respectfully,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Jno E Taylor<br/>
Actg United States Consul</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The statement in the postscript of the 
fifth auditor's letter, as to my having left the 
Colony leaving a letter saying that I should 
not return, is, as the present letter will in part 
evince, not correct. I have never left this place 
for any time whatever without appointing a 
person to officiate for me in carrying on the 
duties of the Consulate. </p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">In reference to the statement of Mr 
J. B. Danforth late purser of the U.S. Navy 
forwarded to me for explanation by Assistant 
Secretary of State the Honble John Appleton, I, 
John Etting Taylor, beg to submit the following 
correct statement of the facts.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No sale of the bill Mr Danforth 
mentions was made to me, nor was there any 
contract for the sale of it to me whatever. 
There was also no contract for the sale of it to 
any one at ten per cent discount. Had there 
been such a sale and contract as Mr Danforth 
mentions the whole of the circumstances would 
have been different. The actual circumstances 
indeed so conflict with the statement which 
Mr Danforth has deemed necessary as the 
ground work of his story, that it is apprehended 
that this statement alone is sufficient to 
deprive his testimony of all title to belief. The 
bill itself it is apprehended will be sufficient 
to demonstrate the untruth of the story that it 
was sold to me; and I have therefore to beg 
that it may be inspected. The bill had, too, it is 
apprehended, to be countersigned by Mr Danforth's 
Commander, Captain Totten, so that it will show 
that it was known to that officer to whom it was 
sold as well a to Mr Danforth. It will show 
in fact it is believed that it was made out 
and signed by Mr Danforth and countersigned 
by his commander for the purpose of being 
sold

<span class="hr"> </span>

sold to Mr Heddle. And it must be borne in 
mind that it was thus made out and signed 
and countersigned before Mr Danforth went 
to Mr Heddle's, for he states that on going 
there he delivered it to that gentleman.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Having I trust shown conclusively 
the unfoundedness of the story sold by Mr 
Danforth, I have now to state what the 
circumstances really were. The part I acted in 
the business, instead of being that of purchaser 
or vendee of the bill, was simply that of a 
broker or commission agent. After having 
had communications on the subject with 
all or most of the merchants at this place 
from whom such an advance of money 
could be expected, I succeeded in making with 
the one of them who has been named an 
arrangement for the sale of the bill at five per 
cent discount; which was a very advantageous 
arrangement, as I had ascertained that the 
rate of discount on bills at 60 days which was 
then current was ten per cent and upwards, 
money being at the time exceedingly scarce 
indeed. After having effected this arrangement, 
I informed Mr Danforth that I expected a 
commission upon it, and mentioned two and 
a half per cent as the rate I proposed, and this 
Mr Danforth agreed to, and in the result paid 
me. In agreeing to the rate of commission 
being two and a half per cent, I understood Mr

<span class="hr"> </span>

Danforth to be influenced by the arrangement 
I had effected being at the low rate of five per 
cent when the current rate of discount on bills 
at 60 days was ten per cent, which was mentioned 
at the time, and he asked if a certificate of 
two Merchants could be procured that the 
current rate was ten per cent, and being 
himself drew up such a certificate, and one of 
the merchants of the colony happening to come 
in at the time, the document was signed by 
him, and then sent out in the usual manner 
for another signature, and brought in shortly 
afterwards signed by another merchant, and 
the usual consular certificate of the respectability 
of the two merchants was then at Mr Danforth's 
request attached to it. And I may add both 
with reference to the testimony they gave in their 
certificate and themselves, that the position of 
these gentlemen is such that it would be impossible 
for a Consular certificate to their 
respectability to be refused without impropriety.  
The object I understood Mr Danforth to have in 
obtaining this certificate was to establish the 
propriety of the allowance of the two and a 
half per cent commission I had claimed; and 
I have no conception that he had any other 
object, and am very sorry to find that 
circumstances have been such that it must 
be supposed that he had. Such an idea as 
that

<span class="hr"> </span>

Mr Danforth would appropriate to himself 
any part of the money he had received for the 
bill never entered my mind, and although it 
appears not to be doubted now that such has
been the case, I feel in looking back at the 
circumstances that I should not have felt 
justified in entertaining such an idea even 
had it presented itself, which it did not, with 
regard to a gentleman holding the position 
which Mr Danforth then did of an officer in 
the United States Navy. I, in fact, had no 
suspicion of the honor or integrity of Mr 
Danforth, nor that he had any object in 
view inconsistent with his honor and 
integrity.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have now to add what I trust will 
decisively establish that the real nature of the 
transaction was as is above stated—namely, that 
I informed Captain Totten at the time, that 
the rate at which the money for the bill was 
to be supplied was five per cent discount, 
and that Mr Heddle was the person with 
whom I had arranged to supply it at that rate. 
It was in fact from me that Captain Totten 
derived his knowledge that it was to Mr 
Heddle the bill was to be sold. The Doctor of 
the Vincennes (whose name I do not remember) 
was also present when this was mentioned by 
me to Captain Totten; and in the conversation 
which took place on the subject not only Captn 
Totten

<span class="hr"> </span>

Totten and myself, but the Doctor also took 
part; and this conversation was expressly 
with reference to the money being got at the 
low rate of five per cent, which both Captn 
Totten and the Doctor expressed themselves 
surprised at in the scarcity of money which 
prevailed. I have no means myself of 
communicating with Captn Totten or the then 
Doctor of the Vincennes, or of recalling the 
circumstances to their mind in case it should 
be necessary in any respect; but hoping that 
they will not have been altogether forgotten 
by them, I have to request that those 
gentlemen may be communicated with on 
the subject, and trust the testimony they 
will be able to give will confirm what I 
have stated.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have only to state further that 
no such conversations between himself and 
me as those Mr Danforth describes ever 
occurred. The statement that they did is, in 
fact, like the statement they are founded 
upon as to the bill having been sold to me 
wholly untrue. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">respectfully submitted.<br/>
