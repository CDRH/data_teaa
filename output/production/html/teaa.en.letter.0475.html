Basoko Camp, Kongo Free State, June 21st 1893.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable - - - - -<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform the 
Department of my return May 12th
to Basoko from the Lomami River.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The following is a brief account 
of the manner in which
the Arab Slave dealers have been
driven from this section of the 
Kongo Free State.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Upon my arrival at Basoko
March 2d Commandant Chaltin
informed me he had received
orders from Inspector of the 
State, Mr. Fivé (who was then
at Lusambo in the Sankuru 
River) to proceed to Bena-Kamba, 
in the Lomami River
and commence operations

<span class="hr"> </span>

against the Arabs, who were
supposed to be at that place
in large numbers, and if successful, 
to proceed to Tchari
60 miles farther south, occupy 
that place, and then return 
to Bena-Kamba, and
proceed to Riba-Riba. Nothing
was said in this Communication
which could be combined
into an order to attack any
Arab posts situated between
Isanghi and Kibongé. Commandant 
Chaltin invited me
to accompany him, as his guest,
but I preferred first to see
Stanley Falls under Arab rule,
as I had an idea they would
revolt in a few months.
I accepted the invitation to come
on a steamer leaving a few
weeks after his departure.
He left Basoko for Bena-Kamba 
March 7th on board
the Steamer "Ville d'anvers" with 
200
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

200 soldiers &amp; 2 Krupp 7.5 cmm Cannon.</p> 
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Steamer "Ville de Bruxelles" was
sent to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Equator[?]</span> Station, 500 miles
down river to bring re-enforcements.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I left for Stanley Falls March
4th and remained until March 17th
when Mr. Tobback, the Resident, Kindly
sent me to Basoko in the steamlaunch
"A.I.A." in order to catch the 
"Bruxelles" on her return.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">During my stay at the Falls
I could see there was a strong 
feeling amongst the Arabs against
the State, and that it only required 
a very small thing to 
begin the war against the Government.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Vali (or Governor) at the Falls, 
Commonly known as Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid-Ben-Said-Ben-Jama-Marajebe
(which means, Rachid, (Ben) son of
Said, (Ben) son of Jama Marajebe),
and a nephew of Tippo Tip was
exceedingly discourteous to me
when
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

when he learned I intended going
to the Lomami.</p>   
 
      <p class="tei_p">The position he held was a most 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">extraordinary[?]</span> one; he was, by 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">appointment[?]</span> of the Governor of the
Kongo Free State, by order of the
authorities in Brussels, Vali of 
Stanley Falls, and received by
salary of six thousand Francs
per annum ($1158.00); he was also
furnished with the uniform of a 
Captain Commandant.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The reasons given for placing at
the head of government at such an
important point, a man with so 
notorious a reputation, were, that
he would be able to control all
the Arabs of this region and so 
prevent any concentrated attack
against the State posts. As future
events have proved the State were
entirely wrong in their estimate of
the Arab strength.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The State had a Resident here,
Mr. Tobback, who conducted all
the
    
<span class="hr"> </span>    

the affairs of Government and was
Commandant of the Post containing
150 soldiers, situated on the right
bank of the Kongo. (see map marked 
Exhibit "B").</p>    
    
      <p class="tei_p">I suppose the population at Stanley
Falls might be put down at 5000,
but it was the greatest Ivory market
in Central Africa. While I was there the
Agent of the Belgian Factory, purchased
in 5 days four (4) tons, worth
in Europe 25,000 Francs (or $4833.00)
per ton <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_symbol tei_unclear_extent_or tei_unclear_extent_abbreviation tei_unclear">[?]</span> to say nothing of rubber.
We sent down to Stanley Pool aboard
the S.S. Archduchesse Stephanie" 18
tons Ivory and 29 tons rubber all
the result of four months work.</p>    
    
      <p class="tei_p">Upon arrival at Basoko I found
the "Bruxelles" not yet arrived, &amp;
was compelled to wait until the 25th
when she came in. On board were 150
soldiers and one Lieutenant and a 
Sergeant; Immediately the Carpenters were
set to work and a strong barricade
placed entirely around her, and on the 27th.
All
   
<span class="hr"> </span>   

All being completed we left for
Bena Kamba, having on board
Leuit de Bock, Sergeant Lamers,
&amp; myself. 150 soldiers, armed with
Albini Rifles, 45,370 cartridges
provisions for the officers and 10
tons of rice for the men.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Nothing of note occurred, while ascending 
the river until March 31st when 
the decapitated body of a woman was
passed, floating down stream. No
cause for this apparent murder could 
be found until that evening the 
steamer stopped at a large village
which was in flames. Two detachments 
of soldiers were immediately
made ready to go ashore, as an Arab
raid had evidently been made.
Mr. de Bock took one and I the other
we each went to an end of the town
and as my men started into the bush
they received three shots from the darkness 
of the forest; we charged the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">place[?]</span>
firing three volleys while on the run
but could see nothing as night had 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">fallen[?]</span>
    
         <span class="hr"> </span>

         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">fallen[?]</span>, so returned to the steamer. On
the way back found eight bodies
of women and children, all headless
and some with their legs and
arms gone. Mr. de Bock found in
the Banana plantation two children
and an old woman, who, after
some hours, were persuaded to tell
us what had occurred.</p>   
    
      <p class="tei_p">It seems the village had been
attacked by a party of Arab slave
hunters about 3 o'clock that
afternoon. They had captured 
over a hundred of the inhabitants, 
and were engaged in destroying 
the town when the steamer
came in sight. They retreated immediately, 
and the shots I received
were probably fired by the rear
guard.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The next morning we followed their
trail some 3 or 4 miles back &amp; found
the bodies of 20 persons men, women
&amp; children, who were too young, old or 
infirm to march rapidly, so
had
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

had been murdered in order to allow 
the caravan to retreat as fast as 
possible.</p>   
   
      <p class="tei_p">As we had orders to proceed
with all despatch and join Commandant 
Chaltin at Bena-Kamba
Mr. de Bock did not consider himself 
justified in pursuing farther
the enemy.</p>   
    
      <p class="tei_p">Such scenes as this village presented 
were afterwards of not unfrequent 
occurrence.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">April 10th another body was
passed, but no cause for death
could be discovered.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Steamer arrived at Bema-Kamba 
the next day, and instead of 
finding a great number of Arabs,
who were supposed to be fortified
here, nothing was to be seen but 
the ruins of the Post established by
the State some years ago. This place
was occupied last year as the 
Headquarters of the Company known
as the "Katanga Syndicate, of which
Mr
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

Mr. Hodister was the chief, and
was destroyed by the Arabs at the 
same time they murdered him and
his Expedition while on the way to
Riba-Riba.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Here we found letters directing the
steamers to come to Lhomo, 20 miles
farther up. We left immediately and
after a day and a half arrived
the S.S. Villa d'anvers" was here, &amp;
the Captain gave us Commandant
Chaltin's orders to march without 
delay to Tchari &amp; join him.
We left the next morning, &amp; that
afternoon encountered the Commandant
returning. He had been most-successful 
defeating the Arabs in an open
fight, and completely destroying
the town of Tchari, which consisted
of 1200 houses and 15000 people.
Two days later both steamers left
for Bena Kamba, where the Expedition
was to be re-organized for its
march to Riba-Riba, through a 
section of country said to be defended
by
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

by a strong body of Arabs.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Small pox had appeared amongst
the soldiers and porters, one white
officer, Mr. Cofféé also had it. The 
Surgeon Dr. Dupont had a bad
case of dysentery, so, as the "Villa
d' Anvers" was leaving for Basoko
in a few days, it was decided to 
send these two offices back.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">March 21st we left Bena Kamba
for Riba-Riba. 505 strong distributed
&amp; formed into columns as follows:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As the men were armed with the Albini
Rifle, and carried 100 cartridges. Besides
this ammunition 40 boxes, each containing 160
cartridges were distributed, this brought 
our ammunition supply up to 34,600
cartridges.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Fifty men of of Company "B" each
carried a shell or canister shot for 
the Cannon, and for the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> of the 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> I distributed the Porters as follows:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">12 men for <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">cannon[?]</span>, weight 230 lbs, in 
3 details.<br/>
12 men for the carriage, weight 240 lbs,
in 3 details.<br/>
4 men for 2 wheels, weight 50 lbs each.<br/>
6 men for 3 caissons, weight 40 lbs.
each containing 65 charges
powder.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The luggage consisted of 3 double
Edgington tents, six camp beds, 3
canteens, containing, cooking apparatus,
plates, knives, forks etc. One trunk
and bedding for each officer,
4 <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Bales[?]</span> of cloth to buy provisions 
on the road, and 11 "chap boxes"
(provision
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

(provisions cases) for the officers. Each 
man carried his own rice, sufficientfor
10 days, as we expected to find food 
for them on the road.</p>   
    
      <p class="tei_p">I would state in explanation of
my having command of the cannon. The 
officer who had been designated for 
this command was sent back to Basoko 
ill with the small pox. This made 
one affair short, so I tendered any services, 
&amp; they were accepted by the Commandant 
in the following terms;-</p>

      <p class="tei_p">-Translation-</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Congo Free State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Commissary of the Aruwimi-Ouelle
District, on mission in the Lomami.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Accepts the services which Mr. R. Dorsey
Mohun offers voluntarily, and charges
him with the command of the Artillery 
Section of the Expedition.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Lhomo, April 19th, 1893<br/>
(sgd) L. Chaltin</p>

      <p class="tei_p">(See Appendix "A" for French Copy)</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The first days march was a 
short
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

short one, as we started late. Two 
cases of small pox appeared that night
&amp; the men were immediately sent back
to the Steamer, which was to stop
at Bena-Kamba until written instructions 
to the contrary were given
by Commandant Chaltin.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The next morning all were on the 
move at daybreak. At 11 a.m. the 
Vanguard were attacked by natives
and in a few minutes the whole column
were engaged. Poisoned arrows simply
raised and strange to say no one 
was struck, but one of the Corporals
had a most narrow escape, an arrow
burying itself 1/2 an inch in the stock of
his rifle. The grass being six or seven
feet high it was impossible to
locate the natives, the fighting therefore
was all on their side, while we
amused ourselves dodging arrows, which 
to say the least was not a pleasant
occupation.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The next day crossed many large plains 
the soft black mud throughout this 

    
<span class="hr"> </span>

entire length, being 1/2 foot deep rendered 
walking very different and 
progress slow. In one of these plains
natives appeared with palm branches
in their hands as a sign of peace.
They had heard of our approach
and asked for protection from the 
Arabs, who had been raiding, murdering 
and pillaging in this section
for years. Two guides for Riba-Riba
were given, which we considered as 
valuable addition to our force, but 
these men, evidently thinking we were
too weak to fight so many people
as the Arabs had, deserted two days
afterwards.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">On the 24th the Welu River was
reached, but the water being too high
no ford was found, However all
hands set to work and in two days 
a bridge 600 feet long &amp; one wide
was completed. On the morning of the
26th all passed over in fine order.
At mid-day the village of Ikamba
was reached. This is the place
where
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

where Hodisters Expedition was massacred.
Nothing was unfortunate affair.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Arabs had deserted Ikamba probably 
in March. All the houses to the number 
of 300 were in excellent condition but
all removable articles had been taken
away by their owners. We lost a soldier
here; he received a poisoned arrow in his 
head, but before falling shot the native
who threw the arrow. Death was almost instantaneous.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">This poison is deadly in the effect
and I have heard of no reliable method
to counteract into effect. It is made
from old urine, which is placed in an
earthen ware pot and exposed to the 
rays of the sun for three days. During
the time of exposure small red ants are
pounded into a powder until about 3
ounces have been collected. This powder
is then poured into the pot and the mess
boiled for three hours, when it has
attained the consistency of molasses, it
is ready for use. The amount required
for three or four days is carried in a 
sling
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

sling at the side. The arrow is dipped in 
and shot dripping.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">That afternoon the entire town was
burned and destroyed, and at 4
p.m. we left for the small village 
of N'bonbon &amp; camped for the night</p>

      <p class="tei_p">A cheerful sight greeted us upon
entering this place; the chief of the 
District, who has the extraordinary 
name of Equansalanamonatea, being 
an ally of the Arabs, had placed
directly across the road sixteen newly
cut heads, (of natives), probably as a 
warning to us what our fate
would be, if we proceeded further.
By direction of the Commandant they 
were buried in the bush.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Small pox had now assumed serious proportion, 
some 30 cases having appeared.
of course it was out of the question 
to think of leaving these people at
any point on the road, as they would 
have been killed by the enemy, so 
we were compelled to take them 
with us.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">March
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

March 29th progress was stopped
by arriving on the edge of what appeared 
to be an immense swamp.
Men were sent in different directions
to find a crossing place, half an
hour afterwards they returned having 
found a road, which led to a 
river, which was broad and swift
and impossible to cross without a 
raft or boats. They were sent back
to look for a better place, but 
soon came back reporting that a 
large armed force of Arabs were
on the other side preparing to cross.
Preparations were immediately commenced
to attack. A force of men under Lt. de
Bock was sent to the right; a similar
force under Captain Marek to the left
Sergeants Nahan &amp; Lamers took up
the centre, and the cannon was conveyed 
to a point which I considered
about 900 feet diagonally <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">appointe[?]</span>
the centre of the Arab position. All
was quiet amongst our men. The 
enemy had not discovered our presence
and
    
<span class="hr"> </span>  

and were creating the most frightful
row in their camp. Horns blowing, Tom
Toms beating, men yelling orders; women
screeching and children crying. They
had three canoes &amp; the first load 
started for the other side where 
Captain Marek was waiting for 
them. Not one escaped. Of course
this was the signal, and the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
became general all along our line 
which extended a mile along the 
river. Receiving orders from the Commandant 
I placed one shell in the 
centre of the camp. This was the only
shot fired, as they shifted their position
&amp; we could not transport the cannon
to a favorable place. Commandant
Chaltin coming up at this moment ordered
me to leave the piece in charge of 
a sergeant &amp; 25 soldiers, and to go 
with him to a place he had found 
directly opposite the camp. Two soldiers 
were with us and we opened
fire with deadly effect. When our
position was discovered we received their 
whole
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

whole fire. Bullets, slug, beads, and 
pieces of brass rods seemed to hail,
but no one was wounded. After 
three hours they withdrew, and 
our camp was made in an open 
space near the river bank, and in 
such a position it could not
be attacked suddenly. The roll 
was called to account for dead
and wounded, but we found that
only one man had a slight bullet
wound in his leg. Considering the 
heavy fire we had been exposed
to it seems extraordinary that
such could be the case.</p>  
    
      <p class="tei_p">Some of the men accompanied by 
me, swam the river, and reconnoitered
the place, but we could not find 
an Arab, dead or alive. The bush 
was covered with blood, but all
the bodies had been removed, which 
is a custom of these people if 
circumstances permit.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The next morning the construction
of a raft was commenced and late
that
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

that night all being finished preparations 
were at once commenced to cross in the 
morning.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">It took all day to send over 150 men
as only 5 at a time could be carried.
When this number was reached it 
was decided to send them to Riba-Riba 
(3 hours distant) &amp; to return as 
soon as the mission had been accomplished. 
Headquarters were established
on the banks of the Kassaku River.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Previous to the departure of this 
detachment, a council was "held to 
discuss the advisability of establishing 
a post at Riba-Riba. It was 
decided impracticable on account of 
the small pox being an epidemic (130 
men having the disease). The Commandant
was afraid to put so many arms 
&amp; so much ammunition in the centre of 
the enemy's country, with the chance of 
all the garrison dying of the disease, thus allowing
valuable stores to fall in the hands
of the Arabs.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">We were to go to Riba-Riba
do
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

do what we could and return to 
Kassaku, when the route for Bena-Kamba 
would be taken.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Riba-Riba was found to be one 
large town, well situated and laid 
out. In front of chief M'Terrera's
house two right hands, belonging
to white men were found tied to 
the flag staff. They probably belonged 
to Messrs. Michels &amp; Noblesse
who were murdered here last year.
The place was deserted, not even
a native being seen. In a short time
everything was in flames, and we 
took up the return march to camp
which was reached at 1 A.M.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">May 1st all sick were sent, under
a guard, back to Bena-Kamba
and on the 2d the remainder of
the Expedition left. We travelled
10 hours of a day reaching the 
steamer May 5th at 2 p.m. making
the return journey in 3 days. It took 
us 9 days to go.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The scenes on the road going back 
were
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

were awful; the dead from the 
sick column lining it every
mile. In many cases one would
fall over a corpse, concealed by
the high grass, and the stench from 
the dead, who had succumbed
on our march to Kassuku, was
overpowering.</p>  
    
      <p class="tei_p">Thirty cases appeared with us 
and they had to make the best
of their way back, there being 
absolutely no method by which 
we could assist them.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Upon our return &amp; the roll being 
called our total  number was
401 persons, 104 having died in 
less than three weeks.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">All the sick were placed in two 
large steel boats and sent down
river under charge of a corporal &amp;
four soldiers.</p>
   
      <p class="tei_p">Departed from Bena-Kamba
May 7th and May 12th reached
Isanghi at the mouth of the Lomami.
This is a large Arab post and 
was

was under the command of Ali <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Rod[?]</span> Ben
Said Ben <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Jama[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Marapibe[?]</span>; son of the Chief of 
Kassongo, commonly known as <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Buana[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Makubua[?]</span>.
A stop was made here for two hours, and as
we knew of no war against the Arabs of
this section of the country confessions of 
eternal friendship were made on both
sides.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Two hours after our departure a canoe
carrying the Kongo flag was met; when 
she came alongside a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Houssa[?]</span> Corporal came 
on board &amp; handed Mr. Chaltin a letter 
from the President at Stanley Falls, addressed 
to the Station of Basoko Bengala,
&amp; Equator. He stated that the Arab had been 
threatening for two days &amp; at any moment
expected an attack on the station, and 
requested assistance immediately for if attacked 
he could not hold out for more 
than eight days.</p>
   
      <p class="tei_p">It was decided to go on to Bassoko, land 
all sick, disinfect the steamer, and leave
for the Falls as soon as possible with a 
new lot of men to take the place of 
those who had died or were ill.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">All
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

All was completed on the 14th and,
at 9 AM we left having on board
250 soldiers, 60,000 rounds of ammunition, 
and 70 rounds for the cannon.
That night camp was made at the 
small state post of Moango, which has 
a garrison of one Corporal and 6 soldiers
with about 20 auxilliaries in the Shape 
of natives armed with muzzle-loading
guns. They had been attacked on the 13th
by a force of Arabs in eleven canoes, but 
these few men killed 10 and wounded 
15 of these, after an hours fighting the 
enemy drew off.</p>
   
      <p class="tei_p">Passed Isanghi the next morning but 
made no demonstration, as the Commandant 
had received no information from the Falls
stating that actual warfare had began.
We all thought war might possibly be 
averted so did not care to precipitate
trouble by attacking Abi <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Bou[?]</span>.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">On the 17th when opposite the Arab Post
of Yafaka, the steamer "AIA" was met
with letters on board for down river.
The Arabs had commenced the fight on 
the
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

the 15th their ammunition was nearly
exhausted and their soldiers had not 
proved reliable, he could hold on for 
6 days, but after that time all would 
be lost unless assistance was immediately 
given.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Being opposite two big Arab stations, we
attacked, captured &amp; destroyed them, 
and at 3 p.m. took up the route,
but were unable to reach the Falls, that 
night. The camp was made three hours
below, and a canoe sent immediately to 
Mr. Tobback saying everything was all
right and we would be with him
in the morning early.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Left at 4 am and in the gray mist
of the morning came off the Belgian 
Factory (which had been captured &amp; heavily
palisaded by the Arabs) The following 
order had been given by the Commandant 
(Translation)- "Order"</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">1st upon arrival at Stanley Falls the 
offices, expecting the Captain (of steamer), will
go on the lower deck, and will take 
measures that all the men are kept out      
of

of sight as much as possible</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2nd When I give orders, the cannon with
be taken ashore and placed in battery.
Captain Marek will go to the upper deck
and send ashore all the shell and cannister.
Mr. Mohun will take ashore at the same
Wine the caissons.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">3d I forbid anyone to fire or give any
orders unless directed by me.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">4th The officers will inform the men
under their command they will be shot if 
found running away or displaying any act
of cowardice.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">On board S.S. Ville de Bruxelles"<br/>
May 17th 1893<br/>
(s) L. Chaltin<br/>
Commandant, Commanding</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">These orders were fully carried out upon
arrival off the Factory we received a heavy 
fire, but no one was touched. A few 
minutes afterwards we landed, and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">few[?]</span> minutes 
after the steamer was made <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">fast[?]</span> the 
cannon had been mounted and the first
shell dropped into the Factory, range 2400
feet. At the 12th shot the steamer went 
to
    
<span class="hr"> </span>    

to the other side &amp; the men carried the-
position at the point of the bayonets, killing
or driving all from the Factory. Double time
was then made for the Arab town.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">While this was going on I had opened
fire (at 4800 feet) on the house of 
Rachid. By the time 15 shell had been dropped 
in various places the troop arrived
and the place was taken with very little
resistance. The Arabs were in full retreat
with the soldiers in hot pursuit, but knowing 
all the paths &amp; by-ways of the forest 
the majority escaped. Rashid, with 
several chiefs got away in a large
canoe. It is estimated that their loss 
was 200 at least.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">In the meantime 150 soldiers had
taken the town on the right bank, killing
the chief and some 75 of his men.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">The Arabs at the Falls were so confident
of success. (Knowing Comdt. Chaltin was in
the Lomami &amp; that it would take at least
a month to bring Soldiers from down river)
they had removed absolutely nothing from
their houses, leaving all their ivory, gun 
powder
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

powder, guns, cartridges, &amp;c in their houses.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Amongst the articles captured I might men-
tion the following:</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">5 tons of Ivory, 107 <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">bbls.[?]</span> gun powder.<br/>
300 cartridges for Martini Henry Rifle.<br/>
200 " " Express Rifle 500 calibre<br/>
50 guns, rifles &amp; smoothbore,<br/>
2000 pieces of cloths, and innumerable matresses,
blankets, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>, and long white linen
shirts without number. The cloth &amp;c were
all turned over to the soldiers as a reward 
for their fine conduct during the 
past few months.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">That afternoon a message came to the 
Resident stating many slaves, soldiers, women
&amp;c belonging to the Arabs deserted to give
themselves up. The first lot, consisting of 
men, women, &amp; children, numbered 400
225 guns were taken from them. During 
the next two days, 1600 more gave 
themselves up; This represents a loss of
2000 people to the Arabs and is an severe
strain on their resources.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">I witnessed many extraordinary scenes 
whilst receiving these people. A great
many
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

many of the soldiers found fathers, mothers,
brothers, or sisters amongst the slaves, and 
some of the meetings and recognitions were
really affecting. These slaves had been
taken some four years ago during a
big raid in the Ouelle. Bomakandi, Itimbiri 
&amp; Likati Rivers. These raids are 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">finished[?]</span> now as the state have troops
&amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">cattered[?]</span> all through the country. All
the Arab soldiers have expressed a desire
to serve the state as soldiers, their desire
will be gratified, but they will not be
allowed to fight against the Arabs
for some time. Probably the Government
will station them in the southern &amp; western ports
of the State, where the natives give much 
trouble.</p>
  
      <p class="tei_p">There being no more danger from the 
Arabs we left the Falls on the 22d &amp;
that afternoon arrived off Yataka, where
the fight of the 17th, took place). There 
was quite a thick fog at the time and
the banks were hardly visible. Knowing
that behind a large Arab town named
Romie existed, the steamer was turned 
in
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

in for the bank and preparations made
to land. Heavy firing was heard &amp; as several 
bullets were heard whistling by us we replied. 
Coming closer the steamer "Princesse
Clementine" was found tied to the bank
Mr. Five, Inspector of the State, and Commandant
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Darren[?]</span> upon arrival off Yataka, on their 
way to the Falls, found the place heavily 
palisaded. They had attacked with 30 
soldiers &amp; had also taken Romie.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Romie was a large town, and supplied the 
Falls and other ports with rice, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp;c.
It might be called a large agricultural
settlement, having some 3000 acres under
cultivation (see map Exhibit C.) The loss
was quite heavy and the natives who
swarmed like vultures over the whole
place, began cutting bodies up to eat,
but Commandant Chaltin had given orders
that it was not to be permitted, and any 
native seen with human flesh in his possession 
was to be shot. I saw several
natives carrying arms &amp; legs down to the 
beach, but a bullet soon put an end
to these proceedings. They say they 
do
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

do not eat human flesh on account
of a liking for it, but as the Arabs
were their enemies, they gain all the 
strength possessed by them when they 
eat the meat.</p>
    
      <p class="tei_p">Both steamers left for Stanley Falls
next morning, after burning Romie.
At the Falls the following order was
published: (French copy marked Exhibit D.).</p>

      <p class="tei_p">(Translation) - Order du Jour</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the officers and soldiers at Falls-

Chief of the Expedition 
Against Riba-Riba and 
Stanley Falls.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The following is a brief history of the 
events which have led up to this war:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is undoubtedly a fact that the
many reverses the Arabs had met with
at the hands of the Van Kerckhoven Expedition
in the Ouelle &amp; Bomakandi Rivers,
&amp; the large number killed and quantity 
of Ivory captured had engendered a 
feeling of hatred against the whites.
This Hodister Expedition in May 1892
on the Road to Riba-Riba, whose commercial
Factories were to be established.
They also murdered the State Agent 
at Riba-Riba Lieut. Michals.
In

<span class="hr"> </span>

In December, 1892 Lieut. Dhamis, 
Commandant of the Camp at Lusambo, 
in the Sankuru, allied himself with 
Congo Lutete, a former slave of Tippo
Tibs. This man is a native of the 
Manyema country and had been,
given his freedom &amp; placed in charge
of a large district in the Lomami by
Tippo Tib as a reward for past services,
but he decided to become a vassal
of the state, renounced his allegiance
to his former master and with all
his people (10,000) passed over to 
the Kongo Free State. Sef Ben Hamed 
Ben Jama Marajibe, son of Tippo Tib
&amp; his representative for the whole of 
Central Africa, residing at Kassongo, 
when he heard of this decided to punish 
him. He left Kassongo with 5000
soldiers in December &amp; commenced his 
march to the Lomami. Naturally as
Congo Lutete had placed himself with 
all his men and guns (4000) at the 
disposition of the State Mr. Dhamis
immediately went to him and they defeated 
Sef

<span class="hr"> </span>

Sef, killing 500, &amp; capturing 600 &amp;
5 chiefs  and 1000 guns. Since that
time Mr. Dhanis' victories have been
continuous and he has occupied the 
most important Arab towns in Central 
Africa, Nyangwé &amp; Kassongo. The total
population of these two places, including 
environs was 40,000.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Kassongo is situated in 4° 20' <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">S[?]</span> and
26° 45' East (approximately) was the property 
of Tippo Tib.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Nyangwé some 40 miles N.W. of Kassongo 
did not belong to Tippo Tib, but was
under the rule of Manie-Mohatra. This 
man ordered the murder of the Hodister
party. He has been captured and hanged
by Mr. Dhamis.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At Kassongo the State had two white 
men Messrs Liepens &amp; de Bruya; as Agents
who were murdered immediately upon
the return of Sef from his defeat in 
the Lomami.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Arabs are now in a demoralized
condition. The only post of any importance 
held by them is <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Tibonga[?]</span>, 
90

<span class="hr"> </span>

90 miles south of Stanley Falls on the right 
bank of the Loualaba (Kongo). An Expedition
under command at Captain <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Ponthers[?]</span>, consisting 
of 400 soldiers, and 2 Krupp Cannon has 
been sent there and by this time the place
is captured. The Arabs muster at least 8000
guns.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is the general of men that the slaves 
of the Kongo State will make Tanganyika
Their objective point, with <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> in German
Territory on the N.E. side their headquarters.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The authorities of the State Government
are to be congratulated upon their success 
in driving these murderers and robbers 
from what was undoubtedly their most
profitable fields. They have for many 
years made life a living Hell for
the natives, over an extent of territory
covering more than 300,000 square miles,
and if the English and German authorities 
on the East Coast will take
measures to stop, absolutely, the sale 
of gun powder it is only a question of 
a few years when we would see the 
slave trade dying a natural death.

<span class="hr"> </span>

I am certain all the powder, cartridges and
