of the United States, no reply to which
has ever been received.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">And if your many pressing duties will
allow you to consider the subject at
this time, I beg you to examine the
Statutes therein referred to, as well
as the precedents, a list of some of
which, is appended.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have requested the United States
Commercial Agent at Monrovia to communicate
the facts in the case, in
official despatches, and doubt not that
you will find at the State Department
such statements as will convince you
of the propriety of affording immediate

relief to those of us who for so long
have been endeavoring to build up a
legitimate trade with the Coast of
Africa, as we have reason to fear
that discriminating duties will soon
be levied upon our vessels, unless
justice is done to Liberian interests
in the United States.</p>

Yours very resp'y<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">The writer begs to call
your attention to his letter of 11 June,
of which copy is enclosed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">being susceptible of proof, the writer
begs leave to refer you to (U.S. Statutes
V4, P308) an act approved 24 May 1828,
as also to (Statutes Vol. 4, P 579) an act
approved the 13 July, 1832, authorising
you to admit future arrivals on
terms of equality, as also to refund
the discriminating duties already
collected, and to inquire what proof
you require and how authenticated
to authorise you to issue the proclamation
therein referred to and 
provided for.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The certainty of discriminating duties
being imposed on American commerce
in the ports of Liberia, by which I 
should be a loser, in case no relief
is granted to Liberian vessels, impels
me to make this enquiry, and to beg
you to give the subject your immediate
attention.</p>
