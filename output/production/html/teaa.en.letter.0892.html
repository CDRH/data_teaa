      <p class="tei_p">Hon. W. H. Seward,<br/>
Sec. of State,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of my Passport to
Monrovia, Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">And also to inform you that it is my
purpose to commence my journey to my
post of duty, tomorrow, (the 10th inst.)
by way of New York.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">If I fail to find a vessel bound
directly for Monrovia, it will be my aim 
to sail for England, by the steamer
from New York, on the 18th inst.: and
by steamer from England, on the 20th
prox; unless I have the honor of receiving
advices from you, which would conflict
with this arrangement.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">Communications or Despatches for me will
find me, until my departure, by being
addressed to me, in care of<br/>
Oscar Irwin, Esq.,<br/>
U.S. Despatch Agent,<br/>
34½, Pine St.,<br/>
New York.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Permit me to express my unbounded
joy at the consummation of an act of justice
long delayed, in the recognition of Liberia
and Hayti, as independent Powers.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I go to Africa under a strong
conviction that, through the blessing of
Almighty God, I shall be permitted and
enabled to advance, and secure the honor
and interests of our government, and of
humanity at large.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to remain,<br/>
Dear Sir,<br/>
Your very Obedient Servant.<br/>
Abm Hanson.</p>
