action is found in the fact that the
compensation of the office is such as
will force any one no many embarrassments. 
This has, unfortunately,
been my experience both in Africa and
at home.</p>

added to when I remember that the 
difficulties surrounding my situation

will be accepted and thanking the
Department for its patience and
great consideration.</p>

Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
