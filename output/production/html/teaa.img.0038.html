  <p>This map is featured in William Coppinger's <em>The Continent of the Future</em>, an analysis of the state of affairs in Africa published in 1881. An interesting piece, largely because it comes from an American point of view preceding the famous "Scramble for Africa" in which European nations colonized most of the continent. One of three maps in the pamphlet, the first shows explorations up to 1877; the second, exploration after 1877; and the third was a map of Protestant missions. They are clearly intended to showcase European presence on the continent.</p>

<p>Coppinger worked for the American Colonization Society (ACS) almost all his life, beginning in 1838. He later served as the organization's Secretary. He had a keen interest in African affairs, particularly as they related to Liberia. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, he wrote several articles on Africa, exploring the state of the continent after colonization. <em>The Continent of the Future</em> is particularly interesting because it predated the Berlin conference. It was serialized in the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>, an African American newspaper which noted that the piece "cannot fail to prove of interest to all persons concerned in the future of the mysterious 'dark continent'." Coppinger had an extensive correspondence with Edward Wilmot Blyden, and many of the latter's view of events in Africa seem to have influenced Coppinger's assessment of Africa's "future." Evident in these maps is the growing interest Europeans were taking in Africa.  Given the role of explorers and missionaries in the eventual conquest of the continent, these maps are valuable sources for understanding how Europeans conquered African communities.</p>
