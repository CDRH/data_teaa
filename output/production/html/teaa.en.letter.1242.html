      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you
that I have relieved the following
seamen of the schooner "Alice" of
Provincetown, Mass. which was
destroyed by fire, in this port, on the 4th
instant; Geo. E. Rich, Edward L. Doyle,
St. Augustine Bravo, Peter Scott and

Joaquin Lopes, Jordan Lopes, and Morral
Gonsalina: all these of Bravo, Cape
Verd Island. They were rlieved according

same book. I had to negotiate a
draft drawn on the Secretary of the
Treasury for ($258.54) two hundred
and fifty eight dollars and fifty
four cents. There are no hospitals
in Monrovia, therefore I were oblige
to have private physicians. Most of
the seamen had African fever and Captain
J. H. Chase died from the effects of
the same. The seamen were sent
to Sierra Leone that they might
secure passage on an American Vessel
from there; and the mode of
living is better, and the price cheaper
there than here, besides there
are hospitals there for treatment
of the sick.</p>

obediently, William H. Heard<br/>
