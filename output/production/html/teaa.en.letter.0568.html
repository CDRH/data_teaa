      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
at St. Paul de Loanda, Nov. 21, 1891</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Whereas we now have a U.S. Board
on Geographic Names, whose duty it is to simplify 
and rectify geographic nomenclature, both
for official and public use, and</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Whereas the official name given in the U.S.
to this city and Consulate, St. Paul de Loanda,
is neither correct nor practical, and has 
been the cause of many petty annoyances,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I respectfully submit to the Department
for the consideration of afore-said Board,
and eventual action of Congress rectifying
the official name of this Consulate, the
following reasons for suggesting that 
St. Paul de Loanda be rectified to Loanda.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(1) The native name of this city was at
the time of conquest, and has been to this
day Luanda, in Portuguese spelling

<span class="hr"> </span>

Loanda, and pronounced by both natives and
Portuguese: Lwándá.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(2) Because the place was discovered by the
Portuguese on St. Paul's day (<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">1484[?]</span>), they,
as was their custom, called it São Paulo de 
Loanda, that is St. Paul de Loanda.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The form San Paolo de Loanda, after seen
on charts and on letters, is half Spanish.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(3) And because the place was reconquered
from the Dutch on the day of the Virgin's
Assumption (1648) the name of Loanda
was enlarged to São Paulo de Assumpção
de Loanda, that is St. Paul of the
Assumption of Loanda</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(4) These cumbersome and highsounding
names were, however, never used by the 
residents of Loanda, whether native or foreign; 
they stuck to the plain Loanda.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(5) The English, ever poor linguists, in
dealing with this name, made two blunders:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">1. On their charts, in their book, and
every where, they preferred to the popular
and plain, the long winded official, name.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">2. Owing probably to a confusion of 
Loanda with Loango, north of the Kongo River,

<span class="hr"> </span>

they wrote and pronounced, instead of
Loanda, Loando.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(6) Now, as in conversation at least,
Englishman and Americans do not care 
for long names, many have taken 
the habit to shorten the name not
by dropping the merely historical St.
Paul and Assumption, but by leaving
our Loanda, and they call the city
St. Paul's. If the word is used
with English speaking people, the question
is which St. Paul's is meant, and
if used with any Portuguese or other
foreigner, no one recognizes Loanda
in that name. Hence misunderstandings,
losses of letters, and other little troubles.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(7) The Portuguese and Colonial governments; 
all the Portuguese and Angolan 
people; the English, German &amp; French
steam navigation companies, whose
steamers run to Loanda; the German,
English and other European mapmakers; 
in a word, all those who
have to do with, or know something
about, Loanda, have for several

<span class="hr"> </span>

years past, used this name exclusively
and the old erroneous St. Paul de
Loando, yea even the correct St. Paul
de Loanda, must be considered practically 
dead, or moribund.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(8) Therefore the U.S. Board on Geographic 
Names, and the U.S. Congress,
(as for as the title of this Consulate is
concerned) would confer a favor on
all concerned - Post-Offices, Schools,
Mariners, travelers, traders, geographers,
and on the U.S.'s representation at
this port - if they would give the 
venerable old term an official burial,
and give their official sanction to the
use of the genuine and modern,
though immemorial, name
Loanda.</p>

Your obedient servant<br/>
