      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">News of a grave character reached
here yesterday from Commandanté,
Dhanis, who is at Kassongo with 
the State Troops engaged with
the assistance of several thousand 
natives, in suppressing the Arab 
slavers.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It seems these Arabs have bought
from a trading house, either on Lake 
Nyassa or the South Eastern end
of Lake Tanganyika many rifles
(repeating) and an enormous amount 
of ammunition (cartridges, powder, etc).
During the middle of October they 
arrived near Kassongo, mustering
it is estimated 10,000 guns. The 
Commandant attacked their boma,
or
    
<span class="hr"> </span>

or palisaded fort, but were
unable to dislodge them. Not
having enough ammunition he
has not been able to repeat
the assault. During the attack 
Captain Ponthier (who distinguished
himself during 1889-90-91-92
as Van der Kuckhoven's second
in the Ouelle Bomakandi Rivers)
was severely wounded in
both legs and Lieut Lange
in the foot &amp; 28 soldiers killed.
Commandant Dhanis has asked
for re-enforcements from Stanley 
Falls, Basako, &amp; Lere. I put 
what force I had with me, at the 
disposition of the Government
and to-morrow morning Novr
13th leave with a caravan
of 575 persons for Nyangawé
&amp; Kassongo, and expect to 
arrive at the latter place in
20 days, by marching 10 hours 
a day.</p>

R. Dorsey Mohun<br/>
Commercial Agent</p>
