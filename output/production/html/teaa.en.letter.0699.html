20th May 1884</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your Excellency</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The present political 
situation of Her Majesty's Dominions, the
most fatal check to her growth as a 
Christian nation, and the prostration of
her commercial interests, is a melancholy
picture in the eyes of the world.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We are a new people just
emerging from long centuries of uncivilization; 
just understanding the virtues and necessities of 
modern progress, and just appreciating the 
force of a national life. We find ourselves
entangled in a political difficulty with a 
great foreign power and unable, from our 
isolation, to appeal to the sympathy of the 
world.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">These difficulties have 
accumulated upon us since the return 
of

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">His Excellency<br/> 
Chester A. Arthur<br/>
President of the United States 
of America</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

of our Embassy till they threaten the dismemberment 
of our beloved country, and the 
ruin of our new institutions.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I will endeavor, in the first 
place, to call to Your Excellency's attention 
the once close and growing commercial interest 
that exist between Her Majesty's Government 
and the United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Her Majesty well understands that no more
intimate ties of national friendship can 
exist than the reciprocal relations of commerce, 
and exchange, between respective peoples. 
With Madagascar and the United States,
there exist more closely and to a greater extent 
than with all other nations combined.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Our people are clothed
with your cloths, our homes are lit with 
your oils, our soldiers are armed with 
your guns. In the many necessities of 
common life and in that great field
which the development of Her Majesty's
Dominions will open to the extension of 
trade and peaceful commerce, we look
to the vast manufacturing abilities of the 
United States to meet our demands and 
to instruct us in the use of modern invention.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On one side Her Majesty's 
Dominions are rich in those products
characteristic of
    
<span class="hr"> </span>    
    
characteristic of country that stretches for 
a thousand miles in the tropics.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We, therefore, earnestly wish 
to throw open our doors to the United States
and to be brought in the closest of commercial relations with that country.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We look, then, with deep
concern to the check to this growth and
this stagnation of the trade with the United
States, and it is not the weakest point
of appeal we make to Your Excellency
in our behalf.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We have noticed with great
pleasure the frequent appearance of the 
United States Flag on our coasts, as good 
evidence of the interest Your Government
takes in us and of the appointment of a 
Minister Resident to our Capital in the 
midst of our difficulties.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We can by these signs
speak the more earnestly to Your Government
on the matter Her Majesty has deemed
it wise to address You.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The history of modern 
Madagascar is one of but few years
in the life of a Nation, but it is a 
history that is remarkable alike for the 
great strides the Hova race has taken
towards civilization, as for their gradual
control over
    
<span class="hr"> </span>    

control over a vast Island inhabited by
conflicting and barbarous tribes and for 
the rise of a new power in that part of 
the world, where the great mass of the 
populations is still plunged in the darkest
barbarian.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The present difficulties with 
the French Republic are well known to the 
world, but we are by their action cut off
from outer communication and thus unable 
to raise our voice in justice to ourselves.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Her Majesty the Queen
wishes to do this, to seek a power that 
will be acceptable to our enemies to discuss
our situation, to justly consider and correct 
these differences without the waste of Her 
Dominion, the distinction of Her Subjects, and 
the blow to the advance of commerce, of
civilization, and of Christianity among
her people.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We ask the good offices
of the United States in this matter for 
the reasons already advanced.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We ask that the United 
States may seek to arbitrate between Her 
Majesty and the Republic of France.
We ask that a commission of arbitration
may be formed, subject to the selection 
of the United States to decide upon 
our
    
<span class="hr"> </span>    
    
our respective differences and justly settle
our difficulties, and by whose decisions
we will abide.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We suggest that the 
place of meeting be left to the United States
to decide, and that a cessation of hostilities
be declared till the final adjournement and 
decree of such commission.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Her Majesty stands ready to appoint her
representatives, and to forward by any
means in Her power the speady and just 
settlement of these difficulties.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Thus I, Rainilaiarivony,
Prime Minister of Madagascar and Commander 
in Chief, have addressed Your 
Excellency in the name of our great
friendship that has already existed so 
long, and in the name of that amity
and commerce which should strengthen
our mutual relations to the Glory of
the Republic, and the Gratitude of 
Madagascar.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">May God bless you Sir,<br/>
Saith Your friend<br/>
(Sig.) Rainilaiarivony<br/>
Prime Minister.</p>
