      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir, Yours of the 17th instant
is received. You must have misunderstood
my letter of the 14th inst. wherein on second
reading you will perceive I did not offer to
pay you $300.- in advance, but $100.- per
year for three years provided I or an Agent
of the House of Brookhouse held the office
of U.S. Coml Agent at Loanda for that
space of time. It certainly would not

be right to pay you $300.- in advance for an
uncertainty, as on your resignation the State
Department might appoint someone else.
I hold myself responsible to do exactly as
I wrote you on the 14th, and will on those
conditions send you on obligation for $100.-
payable at the end of each year for three
years to any party you may authorise 
to receive it.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Very respy,</p>
