      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Commercial Agency,<br/>
Monrovia, Decr 26, 1862.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable Wm. H. Seward,<br/>
Secretary of State, U.S. of A.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I would respectfully beg leave to
call the attention of the Department of State a few
matters of personal interest, connected with this Commercial
Agency. I have delayed until now, under an
impression that the Act of June 5th., 1862, "to authorize
the President to appoint Diplomatic Representatives to
the Republics of Hayti and Liberia, respectively", would
render a change in our representation here, more than
probable.</p>
      <div class="note">Inadequacy of Salary</div>
      <p class="tei_p">I suggest for the consideration of the Department,
that the present Salary of this Commercial
Agency is inadequate for the officer's support.</p>
      <div class="note">Privilege of engaging in trade not available</div>
      <p class="tei_p">The privilege of engaging in trade has hither
to been surrounded by so many embarrassing restrictions,
as to rending it of no practical value to a person

<span class="hr"> </span>

confined exclusively to one place. Moreover, I am
now deterred from engaging in business from a deep
conviction that it would seriously interfere with the
efficient discharge of my legitimate duties, &amp; from
an apprehension that this Commercial Agency
will, ere long, be placed in that Schedule which prohibits the incumbent from trading.</p>
      <div class="note">Unavoidable expenses and the claims of Hospitality &amp; Reciprocal intercourse</div>
      <p class="tei_p">Under these circumstances the expenses will
far exceed the income. I have a family,
and, besides this, the claims of hospitality from
citizens of the United States, and of reciprocal
intercourse with the Officers of the Liberian Government, (exercised even with an
economy so rigid, that it is but little above seeming
parsimony) are such, as have already
convinced me that I shall not be able to meet
the obligations long, from present resources.</p>
      <div class="note">The only established Representative of our Governt to this Republic and hence the calls numerous</div>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg leave to refer to the fact that as I am
the only established representative of our Government
here, (and indeed the only foreigner from
any government) and as this is the Capital
of this Republic, the draft upon my resources
is much more heavy, and frequent, than it
would be under another state of things, which

<span class="hr"> </span>

may be readily conceived.</p>
      <div class="note">Intercourse with this government &amp; people subservient to our commerce and beneficial to persons of African descent now in the United States</div>
      <p class="tei_p">Confiding in the judgment &amp; justice 
by which the Department is governed, I am 
endeavoring to surround myself with those influences
and facilities which will be conducive to the 
successful prosecution of my labors. I am fully convinced
that, by constant vigilance, discretion, to
prompt, energetic action, our intimate intercourse,
with the government and people of Liberia, may
be rendered eminently subservient to the interests
of our general commerce; and of high practical value
in the emergencies which have arisen, and
which are likely yet to arise, in connection with
persons of African descent, now in the United
States.</p>
      <div class="note">Favorable indications of constitutional adaptation to this climate <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">ie[?]</span> physically</div>
      <p class="tei_p">Permit me to say that the indications,
thus far, in reference to my constitutional adaptation 
to this climate, are all favorable. My health is excellent. 
While every white person who came with,
or after me, has had dangerous sickness of the
"African fever", and one amiable and intelligent
German gentleman has died, I am permitted
to record, gratefully, that I have no symptoms of
any disease whatever, though I do not omit

<span class="hr"> </span>

or evade, any necessary exercise or labor, and
have been exposed by night, as well as by day,
to those elements which usually engender fever.</p>
      <div class="note">Acquaintance with officers, people, and country</div>
      <p class="tei_p">It has been my privilege already to form
an extensive acquaintance with the officers of this Republic,
with the Senators and Representatives, (now in
session) and with the citizens generally. On my
journey hither I called at several settlements along
the coast, and have, subsequently, been eighteen
(18) miles up the Stockton and St. Paul's
rivers, and the result of my observations is, a
deep conviction that Liberia has, in the productions
of her soil, (independent of her
mineral treasures) an inexhaustible source of
wealth.</p>
      <div class="note">Suggests that one person, with proper functions, can manage, for some time, all our business here–and could then have compensation on a scale of reasonable indemnity</div>
      <p class="tei_p">I approach with delicacy, the following
suggestion, viz: That one intelligent &amp; industrious
person, invested with the necessary functions, can,
for some time yet, represent our government at
this court, promote, and protect our commercial 
interests, and perform all the labor at the Consulate:
and thus he might be placed upon
a scale of compensation which would, in
some measure, indemnify him for risk &amp;

<span class="hr"> </span>

expenses.</p>
      <div class="note">Many weighty arguments omitted, and the question submitted.</div>
      <p class="tei_p">I would not be becoming in me
to urge this matter upon your attention in
terms more explicit than the foregoing.
I am aware that you will at once discover
my principle design, and, without
exhausting the arguments that bear forcibly
upon the subject, I submit it cheerfully,
and very respectfully, to your consideration.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, with the
highest considerations of respect &amp; esteem,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your Obedient Servant,<br/>
Abraham Hanson,<br/>
U.S. Coml Agent.</p>
