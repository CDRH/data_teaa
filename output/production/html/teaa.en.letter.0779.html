      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Consulate Goree-Dakar<br/>
November 17th 1896</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable W. W. Rockhill<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir: In the "Review of the Worlds
Commerce", years 1894-1895, it is stated that, "The United States is represented
by a Consul at Goree-Dakar, but 
no recent Commercial Reports of the 
Colony of Senegal (French) have been
received from this Officer." Remarks
from other scources to the same effect
have from time to time been brought
to my notice, and it is to explain 
that there has been no wilful
negligence in the matter that I am
writing this Dispatch.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It requires care, trouble, and some
expense to prepare Commercial Reports
for such a Colony as this which
will be accurate and not misleading:
and for such Reports this Consulate,
as at present organized, affords no



adequate compensation. For the June
Quarter of this year my salary from
Fees amounted to only $2.79, and I
have been to expense and trouble for
things connected with the Consulate
which actually makes the office
a burden, which I have often thought
seriously of relinquishing, and yet 
the Commercial importance of this
colony is immensely greater than when
the Consulate was first established.
England, which has no greater interests
here than what the United States
might have, gives her Counsel here
one thousand pounds annually. I
have several times asked for one
fifth of this sum with the right
to do business, but so far without
success. But without as much
as this I am confident that no
blame will attach to me because
I cannot occupy valuable time
in preparing Reports I am Sir<br/>
Very truly Yours<br/>
Peter Strickland, U.S. Consul</p>
