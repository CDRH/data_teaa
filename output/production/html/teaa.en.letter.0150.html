in the despatch No. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and
have had since two cases of Newbedford
and Cape de Verde Island seamen
deserting from Am: Whalers at little 
fish bay, and coming upon this consulate
as destitute, but in both cases I was
able to allow them with their own 
consent to be shipped immediately
on Portuguese vessel and save to 
this consulate and the U.S. Govt.
trouble and expences.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have now a very sick seaman
left at the hospital by the U.S. Vice 
Consul Mr. Newton which I will 
try to have forwarded by this mail
