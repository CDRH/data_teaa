<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>In this sketch, Mohun provides the dimensions for the House of Rachid (most likely "Rashid") at Stanley Falls, present-day Boyoma Falls. The house was 50 meters wide, 10 meters in length, and 5 meters high, with 90 centimeters-thick walls.</p>

<p>Writing to the Assistant Secretary of State, Mohun explained that he "left for Stanley Falls" on March 4th, remaining until March 17th when he headed to Basoko to catch a "steamlaunch" back to Boma. Mohun observed that during his time at the falls, he "could see there was a strong feeling amongst the Arabs against the State, and that it only required a very small thing to begin the war against the Government." Mohun claimed that the Governor at the Falls (also known as the Vali<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>) Rachid-Ben-Said-Ben-Jama-Marajebe "was exceedingly discourteous" to him. Moreover, Mohun questioned the wisdom of the Governor of the Congo Free State who appointed Rachid, believing "that he would that he would be able to control all the Arabs of this region and so prevent any concentrated attack against the State posts." Instead, Mohun noted that the State had underestimated "Arab strength" in the region. When Mohun took command of the Artillery Section of the Captain Louis Chaltin Expedition against Riba-Riba and Stanley Falls<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> in April 1893, he led the attack on Rachid's house, which led to the plundering of the premises and the "capture" of hundreds of items including rifles, gunpowder, cloths, and ivory. The retreating Arabs left behind "many slaves, soldiers, women," etc.</p>

<p>This sketch, dated May 18, 1893, can be read as a document of conquest showing Rachid's house after the successful bombardment a month earlier.</p>
