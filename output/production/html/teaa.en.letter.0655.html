      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour respectfully 
to enclose herewith account
of my transit from my post of
duty to this city where I have
been under medical care ever
since my arrival; copies of Doctors
certificates enclosed.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On my leaving Africa, I was
almost too sick to know what I
was doing, consequently signed
drafts No 7 and eight, in favour of

<span class="hr"> </span> 

Robert S. Newton with the understanding 
that the gentleman
will deduct from said amount
$50 per month for his trouble and
clerk hire, and send me the balance
in a check here; but he has failed 
to do so by the two mails from
Africa, consequently I stopped
payment of check No 7 and 8.</p>

Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">I hereby certify that L. de R. du Verge Esq. Consul
of the United States of America at Loanda has since
his arrival in Liverpool (for more than a fortnight)
been under my medical care, he has had a relapse
of the intermittant Fever from which he has been
suffering in Africa with congestion of the liver,
vomiting, purging, &amp; exhaustion, he has been quite
unfit for travelling, the prostration from which
he suffered, requiring him to remain in bed; I
have advised him not to return to his ordinary
duties at present but to have further respite from
travelling for a time to entirely get rid of the miasmatic
influence he appears to me likely to recover.</p>
