      <p class="tei_p">I had the honour to receive your 
dispatch No 3 dated June 30, a.c. 
requesting me to transmit to your 
Department the statement of the 
aggregate of fees collected at this 
place for the year 1874. I regret that 
I am not able to comply with your 
request as during the time in question 
there was no Consular Officer of the 
U.S. here &amp; consequently no entries 
whatever were made. For the future 
I shall not fail to fulfill the 
prescriptions of the Consular Regulations.</p>

I have the honour to be, Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
