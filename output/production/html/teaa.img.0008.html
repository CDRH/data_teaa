  <p>This is a collage of photographs of Congolese men and women mutilated by Belgian forces for not extracting enough rubber to meet quotas set by the Free State. Cutting off the hands of these workers rendered them incapable of meeting any quota set for them. However, their mutilations served as a warning and a stark reminder to African workers what would happen should they fail to meet their rubber quota. The accompanying article explains that American missionaries and philanthropic organizations working in the Congo sent a memorial to the Congo in April 1904 requesting aid for the "natives." In October 1904, the International Peace Congress convened in Boston and took up the Congo Question. Black readers, upon seeing images of the Congolese victims, might have been reminded of horrors that enslaved African Americans endured when they did not meet their cotton-picking quotas or other tasks. Whether or not they did, the specter of Black people and bodies disfigured for not enriching the coffers of white men and women was not an unfamiliar story.</p>
