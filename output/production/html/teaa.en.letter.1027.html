      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
inform you that your
"Cable Despatch" sent to 
"Goree-Dakar" in order
to reach me was
received on the 7 of Feb'y
1887 after many days
delay owing to the mail
steamers which only stop
at this port twice a month.
I herewith inclose
my

<span class="hr"> </span>

my bond, and would
have sent it some
time ago; but I thought
it was not in my
power to do so unless
a regular appointed
Minister was present
to certify, I hope
no harm will result
from my delay.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Please intercede that
I be detained during
the two years administration
of his excellency
President Cleveland
and I shall do my duty
to the best of my
ability. I hope my
Bond will meet
your

<span class="hr"> </span>

your approval.</p>

Your obedient servant<br/>
