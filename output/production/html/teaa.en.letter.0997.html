      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">You will observe that in my No. 33, date Sept. 17th, 1879, my reply to your Circular–"Separate", June 24, 1879.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">At this time–having gathered some information as to the health of Monrovia, I take pleasure in furnishing the same for the benefit of the Department and the "National Board of Health".</p>

The city of Monrovia is situated on Cape Messurado which at its northern extremity is a broad, high promontory–rich in varied tropical vegitation.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The northern elevation slopes abruptly to the South, forming of the city proper a valley, which is bounded on the east by the mouths of the St. Paul and Messurado rivers and Stockton Creek. The northern and western boundaries–the Atlantic ocean.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The cape becomes narrow gradually, and is narrowest at the southern limit of the city.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">To the north of St. Paul's river mouth, to the south of said river between

<span class="hr"> </span>

between it and Stockton creek, and bordering the eastern side of the Messurado river, are dense mangrove swamps. In addition to these–there is a swamp in the city, just beyond its centre–extending from the base of the promontory nearly the entire length of the city.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The presence of Sylla and Carybdis, these swamps, renders the city at certain seasons of the year, the commencement of the rains and the beginning of the dries, necessarily unhealthy–from the exhalations of dead and decaying vegitable substances, which produce the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the so much dreaded, malaria fevers.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">At no time in the history of the Republic, has any contageous disease assumed, here, an epidemic form.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There have been a few cases of small-pox–brought from the leeward by Kroo men–but have been of short duration.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the whole this portion of western Africa, I mean the whole Liberian coast, is one of the most healthy.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Kidney affections are of a frequent occurrence, and are shown in that particular form known

<span class="hr"> </span>

known as Bright's disease or Albuminurria.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Liver complaints are very prevalent, and are due to to malarial influences.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In the hot seasons–great care must be exercised as to dietary, as diarrhoea and dysentery are of frequent occurrence, and often prove fatal.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Cerebral affections are not uncomon. These appear in the form of malarial fever, but, even that, is not so bad as <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">writers[?]</span> on African fever have represented, it being nothing more than the type of remittent and intermittent fever, which are peculiar to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to portions of the United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">For the year ending October 31st, 1879, there have been twenty one (21) deaths in the city.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There is here a population of about 2,000.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The subjoined table, and the foregoing information (in the general) were furnished by Dr. J. W. Y. David, a practicing physician, and a native of this city.</p>
