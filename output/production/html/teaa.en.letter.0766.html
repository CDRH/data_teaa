      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
Goree-Dakar, October 14, 1887.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable James D. Porter,<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My last despatch, No. 70, was
hurridly written in order that it might
catch the steamer which had already arrived,
and I beg to add, now that I have
had time to learn more, that the reasons
given for detaining the S.S. "Fez" thirty
hours and with her Minister Taylor
are than on a former voyage the steamer
had left the port of Dakar under compromising
circumstances, and also that on 
this visit the captain and passengers
used violent language to the Harbor-Master
when the ships papers were refused
them. The "compromising circumstances
were that in getting under way
in the night her anchor piked up the
chain of a "Messageries Maritimes" coal
barge and did some damage, and that 
she did not stop to rectify the matter.
There

<span class="hr"> </span>

There are insinuations also of some small
bills left behind.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The captain claimed not to be to 
blame for the broken chain for the lighter
was in the public way without any
light. If there were bills it is not unusual
for it is understood that they are
to be regulated afterwards by the consignee.
In any case (for there are so many conflicting
stories that it would be impossible to arrive
at the truth), had the captain had 
pangs of conscience it is not brobable
that he would have called here again.
As for the "violent language" it might be
excused considering the broiling sun to which
they were exposed while waiting at the
mole coupled with the persecutions which
they suffered.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">But be all this as it may, it only
concerns the United States insofar as it 
bears upon the delay occasioned to its foreign
minister and the wrongs he endured
while passing Dakar on board the English
steamer. The French Government
can show that it had no intention of
hindering a representative of the United
States (which idea could no for a moment be
entertained

<span class="hr"> </span>

entertained) for its Medical Director here has
given me permission for him to go directly
on board the Messageries Maritimes Mail
Steamer for Berdeaux which was expected
and did arrive before the departure of
the "Fez", but was actuated only by a desire
to have satisfaction for wrongs from
the British Steamer by stopping her.
But the Messageries Maritimes Company
acted ungraciously through its agent here
(The same who is Her Majesty's Vice-Consul)
who refused absolutely to allow Mr.
Taylor to go on board the Mail Steamer
notwithstanding that the "Fez" had a clean
bill of health. I thereupon addressed
him a very polite letter the copy of which
is enclosed and which he has not answered.
He finds it difficult without doubt to
put his motives in black and white; the 
more so that his company receives a
tremendous subsidy for calling at Dakar
and is probably responsible to a considerable
extent to France. I did not mention
this circumstance in my last, because I
wished to transmit at the same time the
justification he might give of his refusal.
As he has given none I shall of course
drop

<span class="hr"> </span>

drop the matter as it stands. Even
were it my privilege to insist, I should
not do so for I believe it to be highly 
essential not to allow one's self to be drawn
into disputes and dissensions for there
is rarely anything to be gained but on
the contrary one's intentions are sure to
be misconstrued and a stigma attaches
to a Consulate which consequently
loses prestige as well as dignity. This
is more especially true in countries
like Senegal where it is indispensable
to preserve good relations with all.
Therefore my suggestions and requests
in this case were made with all
the modesty and unobtrusiveness compatible
with the occasion.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg to be excused for writing
the details at such length but I remarked
that Mr. Taylor was impatient of 
his detention and believing that he will 
speak of is upon his arrival, I have
thought it preferable to err by sending
too much rather than too little.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir, with respect,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
George Strickland<br/>
Vice-Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Without being indiscreet, I should be obliged if you
would write me why you refused to allow Mr.
Taylor, U.S. Minister to Liberia, and passenger on
the English Steamer "Fez", to take passage on
board your Mail Steamer which arrived the
8 inst and by which he might have arrived
much sooner in Europe. I ask in case my
Governments demands information. Have there
not been precedents of passengers arrived
from the south being transferred immediately
to your line without communicating with the
shore?</p>
