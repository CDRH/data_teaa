      <span class="tei_ab_type_letterhead tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <p class="tei_p">I respectfully report that Loui
Songninett, Cook on the Brig Manson,
was accused of assaulting one Charles
Sumner McGill, a Liberian subject,
while the vessel was lying in this harbor.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Upon the proper warrant being issued
I ordered the Captain of the vessel to take
the accused over to the proper authorities.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I met him immediately upon his
arrival on shore, accompanied him to the
Magistrate's Court, and after considering
the matter advised him to plead guilty
which he did. There were mitigating
circumstances in his favor but
probably of not sufficient weight to have
secured an acquittal.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The fine was $10.00, and cost $3.15.
The

<span class="hr"> </span>

The fine was paid in Liberian currency
making the actual cost $7.50, &amp; $3.15
the cost = $10.65 the actual amount in
coin.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Captain Reeve paid the amount, charging
the same to Loui Songninett's account
and I then had him returned to his
vessel.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, Sir–<br/>
Your obedient servant,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">William D. McCoy,<br/>
U.S. Consul-General</p>
