      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your No. 13,
Dec. 24, 1898, informing me
that the Department did not
desire to impose such a journey
upon me &amp;c. I greatly
appreciate the very favorable
consideration of the Department,
in my behalf. I had seriously
considered my obligations,
and personal bond to the
Department, to faithfully
discharge every, known duty;
besides my recent promise
to make a personal visit to
said

<span class="hr"> </span>

said Cape Coast Castle
Agency, early in 1899. In
keeping with your urgent
desire to know why said
Agency should be continued,
and my promise to make
an early personal investigation
and report upon the
matter, I have to inform
you that I had on the 18th
January 1899 purchased my
ticket, from Monrovia to
Cape Coast; and had, through
Hon. W. A. Ring, British Vice-Consul, 
and Agent African
Steamship Company
arranged for a State Room
and passage on the S. S.
Rochelle, from Liverpool;
over due since Jan. 18, 1899,
which arrived Sunday
evening Jan. 29, 1899. I
regret exceedingly, that I
could not have received
your No. 13, in time to
have

<span class="hr"> </span>

have saved the passage money;
but as it did not, and I have
already paid my passage
down and can not have
the money refunded I
know no other, now, but to
go.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is my earnest desire
to render entire satisfaction,
in the administration of the
affairs of this Legation, during
the time of my encumbency,
and have no possible
means of knowing, that I
have thus succeeded, except
that of a clear conscience of a
faithful effort to please. I
would be pleased to have,
from you some expression
of the sentiment of satisfaction
or dissatisfaction on the part
of the Department, of my
labors, thus for rendered.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be your
obedient servant, Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
C. G.</p>
