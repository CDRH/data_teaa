      <p class="tei_p">No. 47. U.S. Consulate at<br/>
Sierra Leone Feb. 5th 1881.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon Jay Hay<br/>
Ass't Sect'y State<br/>
Washington</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform
the Department, of the threatening
aspect of affairs on
the "Gold Coast" - as the King 
of Ashantee has again
declaired war on the English
Colonial Government Headquarters
at Accra.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is generally thought in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Some[?]</span>
official circles, that if the
Ashantees fight again, they 
will be a still more formidable
foe than before - for it is believed
they are well armed with breech
loaders and not a few pieces
of artillery - they have the reputation
of being brave - standing up and

receiving the bullets square in
their breasts.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On Friday Jan 28th the Mail
Steamer "Corisco" arrived in
Port from the Gold Coast

purpose of taking all the
available troops from this
place - after stopping an hour
at Sierra Leone for the
mails - the Corisco hurried on
to make the run as quickly

and place himself under British
protection.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is reported that the Gamans
have paid more than £800. as
ransom for this captive Prince
on the repeated promises of 
the Ashantees to give him up,
but no sooner do they receive
the ransom money, than they
break their pledges.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Kings demands were refused
by His Excellency the Governor and
we understand a counter demand
made upon the King to pay
up the instatment of indemnity
which it appears he has
failed to pay.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Every war like preparation
is now hastily being made
and the prospects for war
are as good as they have 
been in former times, when
severe fighting was the result.</p>
