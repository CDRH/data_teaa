Sierra Leone Nov 25. 1872</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honbl. Charles Hale<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have had the honor to receive your despatch
No 1 dated 2 September, announcing that the
President had been pleased to appoint 
me Consul at Sierra Leone West Africa. 
In accepting the appointment with which 
I have been honored, it will be most 
gratifying to be the representative, 
even in the humblest degree the 
Country where I spent so great a
a portion of my life. I beg to inform
you that I am a native of 
Newfoundland, and that I never resided 
in Great Britain. I have been a 

<span class="hr"> </span>

resident on the Coast of Africa more 
or less for twelve years. I would also 
remark that there is not a single 
American Citizen in Sierra Leone. 
Inclosed you will find the necessary oath 
taken before the U.S. Consul at Madeira 
where I shall be a resident for a few 
weeks for the restoration of my health. 
The bond has been forwarded to my 
friends in New York for execution 
with direction to have it sent to 
the Department without delay.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
William Hogan</p>
