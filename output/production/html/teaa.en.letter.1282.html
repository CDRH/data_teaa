      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
say, that neither the city, nor
the Government, has a
health officer; nor a board
of health; from whom or
which we can obtain
the desired Sanitary
information, demanded in
the weekly Sanitary Report,
to the Secretary of the
Treasury. It is with the
utmost vigilance, that we
are enabled to make any
trustworthy report. We
obtain our information,
principally,

principally, by a constant watch,
inquiry, funeral notices, and
processions. In these it is very
difficult for us to learn of
the diseases or causes of death.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The above, I have not
communicated to the Secretary
of the Treasury.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
your obedient servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
M. R. and C. General.</p>
