      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
transmit to you the intelligence
that on the 6th of
Sept., 1898, I vacated the
quarters rented by my
predecessor, Hon. W. H.
Heard, for the use of the
Legation; and moved
back to the building, formerly,
rented of Mr. Sharp, and
used as the Legation, prior
to the administration of the
Hon. Mr. Heard, on the 7th
instant. The present quarters,
not having been rented
to any specially selected

<span class="hr"> </span>

class of persons, since its
vacation by the Hon. Mr.
Heard, was found to have
been very badly used; the
repairs of which are now
going on, at the expense of
the premises; while the
Legation pays for cleaning
building and premises.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The terms of the
contract have not yet
been reduced to writing,
but do soon as possible,
will furnish the Department
with a copy.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
your obedient servant,<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith.</p>
