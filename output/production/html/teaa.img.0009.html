<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This cartoon depicts King Leopold's depredations in the Congo Free State. Leopold sits on his throne, which is decorated with human skulls and bones. In his right hand, he holds a chain that tethers two African men to him. In his left hand, he clutches Belgian Francs, and a rope of rubber hangs from his left arm. The smoke from the king's cigar obscures a portrait of what was likely a member of the royal family. The smoke billows up to touch a human skull sitting on a shelf. Behind the throne are bags of money labeled "murder," "arson," "greed," and "robbery." Two human bones lie strewn on the floor on the side of the throne. The two Africans face the viewer while Leopold looks off to the side. The taller of the two men is emaciated with "Congo Free State" written across his chest. In his left hand is a rubber frond and he wears a checkered loincloth. The shorter of the men also carries a rubber frond, but his loincloth reads "Official War Dog Eats ____ Alive for His Majesty." The cartoon mocks Belgian "civilizing" efforts in the Congo as nothing more than a scheme to rob the area of its rubber and to profit off the deaths of African workers. The article featuring the cartoon posited a "feeling of brotherhood" between the African American readers and the Congolese people under Leopold's rule.</p>
