      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Comcl Agency<br/>
Gaboon Jany 3d 1866.</p>
 
      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon. Wm H. Seward,<br/>
Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir: I have
the honor to acknowledge, since my last, the receipt,
from the Dep. of State, of despatch No 14, requesting 
me to continue to act as Vice Comcl Agt &amp;c., 
proclamation of president Johnson in relation to 
N. Carolina, Circular in relation to the Am.
Geo. and State Soc. N.Y. and a copy of "List of 
Diplomatic &amp; Consular offices &amp;c."</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I reply to note on page 2 of said "List," that
the "Manual" here, was printed at "Washington, 1863."</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To note on page 54, I reply that "Gaboon"
is erroneously put, on page 10, among "Portuguese
dominions." It should be among French 
on page 9.</p> 

      <span class="hr">Â </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have no arrivals of vessels to report 
during the past six months, nor any fees.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">During the year 1865 only two 
American vessels (barks) have entered this port.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">There is no material change in
the trade. The articles of export (Ivory and 
Barwood) are becoming yearly scarcer &amp;
dearer; and year by year subject to 
more &amp; more <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> competition.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, Sir, your obt servt<br/>
J. M. Preston<br/>
Vice Comcl Agent.</p>
