St Paul de Loanda<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to report the arrival here of three
American sailors on the 13th inst, in the Mail Str
"Angola". The Captain of the "Angola" states that 
he was requested to bring them from Benguella to 
this port, where they would find a Consular officer
to understand and look after them.</p>

from the American Whaling Barque "Matta
Poisette", Captain Stegburgh, of New Bedford,

      </p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">When out whaling, they also complain 
that the mate refused them water, and
made them pull for hours without a drink,
there being plenty of water in the boat.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The men have nothing but what
they stand in, so I have taken charge
of them, and send them to the Cape
de Verde Islands by the present steamer,
Paying £5. (five pounds) passage money
for each</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Their names are Andrew Schmitt,
Louis Umlandt, and Niels Hansen.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
U.S. Vice-Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
