      <p class="tei_p">No. 38. U.S. Consulate at<br/>
Sierra Leone Dec. 17th 1880.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon John Hay<br/>
Asst. Secretary State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform
you that Walter Duval, an
able seaman - a deserter
from the American Bark "Jennie
R. Deverty" - came upon this
Consulate from Edina or
Grand Bassa per S.S. Lualaba
Dec. 11th 1880. and made oath
to the enclosed deposition.
The said sailor was sent to
this Consulate by Lt. A Williams
U.S. Commercial Agent at
Grand Bassa - with an order
on me for his passage - 
which order amounting to
£1-2-10 I paid.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This is the 4th man who
has come upon this

<span class="hr"> </span>

Consulate from the said
Bark "Jennie R. Deverty" - 
Weed Master from Boston</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I cannot tell why the 
Master of the said "Deverty"
or the U.S. Commercial
Agent at Grand Bassa
should allow so many sailors
to desert and make no effort
to prevent it and would
respectfully recommend 
an investigation.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The said Jennie R. Deverty
I believe is still on the Coast 
South of here and I do not
know when she will sail
for the United States
The aforesaid Walter Duval
will be sent to the Unite States
by first opportunity.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have also to inform the
Dept. that I sent Frank
Withers and Chas Worrell two
destitute seamen from "Jennie R.
Deverty" to New York Dec. 13th 1880.

<span class="hr"> </span>

Personally appeared before me
at my office this day Walter Duval
who makes oath as follows.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I shipped on or about
the 29th of July at the Port of
Boston Mass. as an able
Seaman in the Bark Jennie
R. Deverty - Weed Master
for the West Coast of Africa
The Bark first touched at
St Vincent Cape De Verde
Islands - where we remained 
for about three days and
discharged 1400 ft of Lumber
to the American Consul - thence
to Monrovia where we arrived
early in September - remained about
two and a half days - sold considerable
Rum at this place - business other
Cargo - At Monrovia I refused
duty because I had no place to
sleep and had none during the passage
and nothing fit to eat - all owing 
to the Cook - as there was plenty good
provissions on board - but the
Cook

<span class="hr"> </span>

Cook was a thoroughly <del>a</del> bad
man - and the Captain believed in
him - The Captain therefore made
out in his official log - one whole
page against me and charged me
with mutiny. He read this charge
to me in Grand Bassa Bay and went
ashore in Edina and reported me
and one other man <del>and</del> to the
American Consul Mr H. A Williams
Mr Williams sent a Sealed letter
directing me to report to him on
Shore - which I did - when I saw
him I told the Consul who I
was and he read to me the official
Log - which statements I denied -
I asked the Captain how he could
make out a charge of mutiny
for refusing to do duty - 
He replied for influencing the
men - He could not sustain
the charge for all the men testified
that I had not in any way tried
to influence them -</p>

      <p class="tei_p">He then took up the Case of provissions

<span class="hr"> </span>

food from the Consul - being
sick some of the time -</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the 9th Instant the Consul
Mr Williams put me aboard
the steamer Lualaba giving me
a letter to the Captain also one
for the Consul at Sierra Leone
where I arrived Dec. 11th 1880.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Walter Duval</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sworn to before me at my
Office Sierra Leone this 11th day
of December 1880.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Judson A. Lewis<br/>
