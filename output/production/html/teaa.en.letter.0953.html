      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have had the honor to receive your despatch numbered fourteen, dated October the fourth, and relating to my despatch numbered twenty seven with which was returned to the Department the Certificate of Appointment of Rudolph Hürsch Esquire as Vice Consul General at Monrovia; and referring to the illegibility of the name of the gentleman offered in place of Mr. Hürsch . Inasmuch as the malady with which Mr. Hürsch was afflicted when

when his Certificate of Appointment was returned resulted in that gentleman's death, my action in withholding the Certificate would seem Judicious. I regret the illegible manner in which the name of the other gentleman was submitted. That gentleman's name is spelled correctly: Marianus Adrianus Anmey</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir:<br/>
With feeling of great respect,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
J. Milton Turner</p>
