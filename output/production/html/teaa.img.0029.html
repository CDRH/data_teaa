<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>In this cartoon, Ethiopia wears a flowing classical gown, one similar to those found in personified representations of the United States as Columbia, and carries a shepherd's crook (a symbol of ancient Egyptian royalty) as she bears witness to the slaughter of African Americans in the South during the post-Reconstruction period. The cartoon's caption features a dialogue between the two central characters, with Ethiopia asking the representative of the United States, "See how my people are murdered, maltreated and outraged in the South, and you, with a great army and navy, are taking no measures to prevent it. Will the day of retribution never come?" Uncle Sam's response reveals contempt for Ethiopia's sense of urgency, as well as the corruption of his government: "The administration is engaged just now in rewarding the faithful (appointing them to fat offices). When this is over we shall look into your race."</p>
