      <p class="tei_p">Hon. W. H. Seward,<br/>
Secretary of State.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you
of my arrival, in safety, at my destination, and also
that I have been duly received and accredited as
U.S. Commercial Agent at Monrovia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The officers of the Liberian Government have
been prompt and cordial, to an extent far beyond the
claims of my official rank; and, though I have 
studiously endeavored to avoid taking any steps which
were likely to elicit special hospitality, yet, I have been
met at every point by a marked attention, an agreeable
courtesy, and a generous confidence; and I feel
assured that every facility and opportunity will
be at my command for the efficient discharge of

<span class="hr"> </span>

the duties of my office.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg leave to refer to this matter in this form, for
the purpose of vindicating myself against any
seeming obtrusiveness beyond my present,
proper sphere.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As soon as I have had an opportunity
to acquaint myself with the records of my office,
and have rallied from the physical prostration
resulting from eleven weeks of long &amp; weary
travel, by land and sea, I hope to communicate
more at length.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose, herein, a
copy of the inventory of papers, books, and other
effects delivered to me by the person whom I found
in charge of the U.S. Com. Agency, at this post
and have the honor to remain</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your very Obedient Servant,<br/>
Abraham Hanson,<br/>
U.S. Com. Agent,
Monrovia</p>
