      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">To avoid confusion in my plan of work, I should
know before setting what the limits of the Commercial
Agency of St. Paul de Loanda are. According to
paragraph 30 of the Consular Regulation I understand
them to embrace all of the two Provinces of (a) Angola
(b) S. Thomé and Principe; for the latter is nearer
Loanda then San Tiago, the next northern U.S.
Consulate in Portuguese territory.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As I can judge from the progress of 
my book on Angolan Legends, I shall be 
able to sail by end of June or first <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">part[?]</span>
of July.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant,<br/>
Heli Chatalain<br/>
appointed U.S. Commercial Agent, Loanda</p>
