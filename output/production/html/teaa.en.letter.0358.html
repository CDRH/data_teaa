Zanzibar, January 11 1891</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable Wm F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour to
forward herewith copies of a
correspondence relating to an
additional duty levied on
imports to the German East
African Coast of Zanzibar,
and to address the Department
briefly regarding the same</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Dominion of the
Sultan of Zanzibar formerly
comprised the whole of the
East Central African Coast
and adjacent islands until
this year, when the Sultan
was induced by Germany
and England



and England to sell
to the former his sovereign
rights in about 400 miles
of this Coast, (transferred <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">2nd[?]</span>/1/91)
leaving for himself the
islands of Zanzibar and
Bomba and a small piece
of Coast to the North, all
under a British Protectorate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By the treaties with
Zanzibar, it is specially
provided that goods which
have paid 5% duty once
shall pass free through
any ports of Zanzibar
territory, and it has been
customary to import to
the island of Zanzibar
all goods intended for
East African trade and
paying duty there, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
to the various Coast ports,
the island acting merely
as a distributing center
and not as a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
      </p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">On December 22d last,
notice was received from
the German Consulate,
that, from Jan'y 1, 1891,
"the duty" would be taken
on the German Coast
for account of the German
Government, meaning that
5% duty would be levied
on all goods imported to 
the German Coast, whether
they had previously paid
to the Zanzibar Customs 
or not. This duty is
now in force there.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The American house
of Mess. Roper, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp; Co.
hold in this city a lot of
goods destined expressly
for the German Coast, on
which they have paid 5%
duty to the Zanzibar Customs,
and on their representing
this fact to me and also
the impossibility of making
shipping



shipping and storage
arrangements in the
space of eight days. I
filed a protest against
this duty being levied
with the German Consul,
as per copy inclosed.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">At the same time
I addressed H. H. the Sultan
through the British Agency,
protesting against another
duty being allowed to be
charged on goods already
passed at Zanzibar, and
claimed a free market,
or a drawback on all
American duty-paid goods
here for export to said Coast.
In reply, the British Agent
states that he is in a
similar situation in regard
to British subjects and is
unable to make any statement 
until he is advised
by his Government, to
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
      </p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <span class="tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_page tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_reason_image tei_gap">[illegible]</span>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am of the opinion
that, as the Sultan only
could sell something that
he possessed and he never
possessed the right to levy
a second duty of 5% on
goods duty-paid in Zanzibar, 
the Germans have
no legal rights to levy
such duty, and the 
Sultan is responsible for
allowing this state of things
(of course it being understood 
that the Sultan
is but a name, England
being the responsible party)
As contracting party to
the treaties the Sultan
has agreed that one duty
of 5% passes all goods free
through all ports of his
dominions, and I believe
him to be responsible for
any <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> caused by a
transfer of any port of
his dominions



without any notice whatever 
to the Treaty Powers.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The amount claimed
by Mess. Roper, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp; Co
is 5% drawback on $44,746.00
value of duty-paid goods
specially imported for-sale 
on the German Coast
and held by them in the
city of Zanzibar on the
1st of January 1891 say
$2,237.30, and in submitting
this claim to the Department 
I consider that we
have a clear case against
the Sultan through the
English Protectorate, and
trust that the Department
will endorse my opinion
and take proceedings
towards payment of the claim.</p>

by order of the Imperial German

5% duty to the Zanzibar Customs.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">These goods were imported

      <p class="tei_p">The American house of
Roper, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp; Co. hold in this

they have paid 5% duty to the
Zanzibar Customs. Under
existing treaties, one payment
of 5% admits goods free to all
ports and ports of the Sultan's

under this treaty right, these
goods were imported from the

Dominions leased to the German
East African Company.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the 22d inst, I received
notice from the German Consulate
that from January 1st 1891, duty
would be taken on the German
East African Coast for account
of the German Government, from
which I infer that some transfer
in the Coast Government has
been made although no notice
of any such transfer has been
received from anyone, at this
Consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">If this additional duty
is allowed to be levied on the
Coast at nine days notice, I am
of the opinion that a drawback
of 5% should be allowed by
H. H. the Sultan to Roper, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp; Co
on all duty-paid goods held
by them



by them now in Zanzibar
and which can only find a
market on the German Coast,
or that some arrangement should
be made between H. H. the Sultan
and the German authorities, by
which these goods may be
imported free into the German
Coast within a reasonable time,
say six months.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I presume that, in the
future merchandise for the
German Coast via Zanzibar
may be transhipped in bond,

favorable arrangement is made.</p>
