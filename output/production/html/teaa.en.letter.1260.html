      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Having made a
personal visit to the Cape Coast
Castle, Consular Agency,
Gold Coast Colony, Africa,
I have the honor to transmit
to you the following
report, viz.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">1. I beg to be permitted to
correct an erroneous
misstatement, in my
No. 12. "Consular," of Nov. 16, 1898,
in which I said, upon
the authority of the Steamship
Company's Agent, that the
distance from Monrovia to
Cape Coast Castle was
11 days

<span class="hr"> </span>

11 days journey, or over "2000
miles." We made the
distance in ten days. The Captain
of the Steamer informed
me that it was between 900
and 1000 miles.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">2. Before reaching Cape Coast
Castle, I learned that the
former resident and
office of George E. Eminsang
Esq., late United States
Consular Agent, at Cape
Coast Castle, was at
Elmina, about 8 miles
west of Cape Coast
Castle, even, before reaching
the Cape. Hence I 
disembarked, at Elmina,
Feb'y 8, 1899.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">3. Upon inquiry, I soon
learned that J. E. Eminsang
Esq., son of the late
George E. Eminsang, and
the person whom I had
temporarily appointed Consular
Agent,

<span class="hr"> </span>

Agent, in August 1898, was
living at Cape Coast Castle.
On the 9th Feb'y I telegraphed
him to come to Elmina.
He came in the afternoon
of the same day. He informed
me that the Colonial
Secretary, at Accra, had
refused to grant him an
exequatur, upon the ground,
that his appointment should
have came from the
Secretary of State, Washington.
Hence, the younger Eminsang
had not been in
the discharge of the duties
of the Agency. Having
sent for him, and finding
myself unable to speak
the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> tongue, I employed,
J. E. Eminsang, as clerk,
interpreter and guide, for
two days.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">4. I found the office fixtures,
archives &amp;c., in the 
room

<span class="hr"> </span>

room, formerly, occupied by
George E. Eminsang Esq., late
United States Consular Agent.
They were in a very bad
and much dilapidated
condition. After, taking a full
inventory of same, I purchased
a new lock, as the
key to the old lock was in
the possession of the administrator,
had it put on the
case containing archives &amp;c.,
locked it; and by permission
of J. E. Eminsang Esq.,
son of the late George E.
Eminsang deceased, I left
the case, archives &amp;c., in the
room, which was locked,
taking the key to the case
with me. In case the
Agency is cautioned
see accompanying requisition
for official supplies,
for said Agency.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">5. The last official quarterly
report

<span class="hr"> </span>

report made to the Legation,
by the late George E. Eminsang,
was made June
30, 1897. His son J. E. Eminsang,
who acted as clerk
for his father, says his
father made up a subsequent
report, for the quarter ending
September 30, 1897,
but on account of ill
health never forwarded
said report to the Legation.
The records of the Agency
show that the work was
regularly discharged, upto
Feb'y 28, 1898; one note of
protest, the which I forward
to the Auditor for State and
other Departments, is duly
executed by the Captain
of the ship, and bears date of
<span class="underline">March</span> 1898. Accompanying
this note of protest C. C.
Aikins Esq., Administrator of
the estate of the late George E.
Eminsang,

         <span class="hr"> </span>

entered Gold Coast Colony
ports during 1897.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sail vessels cleared from
Gold Coast Colony ports,
with cargoes for the United
States, in 1897, 7, tonnage

      <p class="tei_p">7. Willie F. Hutchison Esq.,
whom I some time since,
recommended as Consular
Agent, at Cape Coast
Castle Agency, is still in
London, with no
certainty when he will
return. I therefore take
pleasure in nominating
Fynn E. Asaam,
Esq., of Cape Coast Castle,
a man who was
educated in England, and
is very highly recommended 
to me as a 
man suitable for the 
position. He is about 38 
years of age.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">8. In returning, I was forced
to embark upon the fast
Royal Mail Steamship,
Axim, from Cape Coast
Castle to Sierra Leone,
with the hopes of making
connection at Sierra Leone,
for Monrovia; or to make
an indefinite stay in Cape
Coast Castle, awaiting
an <span class="underline">all</span>
         <span class="underline">port</span> Steamer by
the way of Monrovia;
but after geting on board
the Steamer, and before
leaving the Cape, the Captain
received a telegram to call
at Monrovia for Bishop
Grant of America. Hence,
I availed myself of the
opportunity of getting off
at Monrovia, without
going by the way of Sierra
Leone. I have the honor to
be your obedient servant;<br/>
