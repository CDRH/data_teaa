      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In my communication of the 7th of 
June I requested their permission might be granted 
me to visit America for the purpose of recruiting 
my health. The state of my health is such as
to render a change of climate necessary. I shall 
therefore take passage upon the American Barque 
Greyhound, which leaves this port on the inst
bound direct for New York; leaving the affairs
of this Commercial Agency in charge 
of Rev. J M Preston, requesting you will 
confirm his appointment as Vice Commercial 
Agent at this place. Mr. Preston is a citizen 
of the United States, was born in Massachusetts, and 
has been for the past sixteen years in connection 
with the American Board C.F.M. at this place being 
well known here on in America as a man of unblemished
character. Enclosed will be found his oath 
of allegiance. Submitting the above for your 
consideration. I have the honor to be your 
obedient servant Henry May<br/> 
U.S. Commercial Agent.</p>
