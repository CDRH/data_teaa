commanded by Captain Otto Herbig arrived at this
port on the 17th August on her way from the China
Station, having touched at Angra Pequena. She
took in coal and proceeded on the 21st for Gaboon

treaties on behalf of the German Government 
at different places on the North Coat, especially
at Cameroons and the Forcados Rivers. But
