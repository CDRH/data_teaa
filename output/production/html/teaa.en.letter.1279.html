      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
say, that in preparing to
make my departure from
America, for this post of duty;
I packed and brought, with
me, quite a number of volumes,
from my library;
besides many household
effects; such as bedding &amp;c, as
I was expecting, as I did
do, to bring my wife and
child with me. We were
shipwrecked, off the coast of
Wales, on the ill fated
Dahomey, April 9, 1898.
The contents of two large
trunks

trunks, including the foregoing
effects, that were in the hold
of the ship; being a week under
water, before they were
taken from the ship, were
very badly damaged. The
atmosphere, here, is very
detrimental to books &amp;c, in the
most perfect condition. Hence,
as my wife desires to
return home, with me early
in the Spring of 1900; as
per my pending request for
leave of absence, with
permission to visit America;
in 1900, I desire, if it please
the Department, a release
from the annoyance of the
Custom officials, upon my
arrival in New York.
I hope to reach New York,
from Hamburg, sometime,
between the 25-30, April 1900.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be &amp;c.,<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
M. R. and C. G.</p>
