<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Born free to Romeo and Judith in the Danish Virgin Islands in 1832, Edward Wilmot Blyden would surpass all the dreams his parents would have had for him. Over the course of his life, he was a teacher, pastor, diplomat, and journalist. Growing up in the Charlotte Amalie neighborhood of St. Thomas, the young boy caught the notice of John Pray Knox, pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church the family attended. Seeing potential in the boy destined to become a tailor like his father, Knox arranged for Blyden to be enrolled at the Rutgers Seminary in New Brunswick, New Jersey, his alma mater. Denied admission because of his race, and no doubt fearful to remain in the United States where the Fugitive Slave Act had just been passed, Blyden took the opportunity offered by the American Colonization Society to settle in Liberia.</p>

<p>Educated at the Alexander High School and Liberia College, he would go on to teach at both institutions, serving as President of the College. Blyden represented Liberia as Ambassador to the Court of St. James and served in other official capacities in Liberia and Sierra Leone. He is best known for the pride he took in his African heritage and is often referred to as the Father of Pan-Africanism. He was a staunch proponent of the "back to Africa" movement, calling for African descended women and men to go to Africa to help uplift the continent. In later years, he argued that indigenous Africans should take the lead in developing the continent through education.</p> 

<p>Much of Edward Blyden's life was devoted to showing the capabilities and achievements of Africans. His pride in his ancestry and the continent was unswerving. In 1856, he declared: "Africa! There is no heart beating under a covering of sable hue, which does not throb with emotion at the sound of this word."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Edward Blyden died in Sierra Leone, West Africa, in 1912.</p>
