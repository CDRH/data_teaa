      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
Zanzibar, August 1, 1887.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon.<br/>
Third Assit. Secretary of State.<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform
the Department of some recent
changes in the Consular Service 
of the different European Nations
represented at Zanzibar.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dr. Arendt late Imperial German
Consul General at Zanzibar
has returned to Britain and has
been relieved by Dr. Michahelles.
It is presumed that Dr. Arendt 
has been recalled by his Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is also understood
that Mr. Holmwood, lately
H. B. M.

<span class="hr"> </span>

H. B. M. Acting Consul General 
of Zanzibar, who has been 
relieved by Maj. MacDonald,
has been recalled at the 
instance of Prince Bismark.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In this connection the
resignation of Sir John Kirk
H. B. M. Political Agent and
Consul General is significant: 
since it would appear to be
in the direct line of British
non-interference with the project
of the German Government
for the colonization of the
East Coast of Africa.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Diplomatic relations
having been resumed between 
the Portuguese Government and
His Majesty the Sultan. The
Portuguese

<span class="hr"> </span>

Portuguese flag was again
hoisted at Zanzibar on the 
15th ultimo. Le Vicomte 
de Castilho being Consul Gl. 
and Chargé d'Affaires.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">M. Hermanigilda the
special Envoy of the King
of Portugal is at present
in Zanzibar accompanied
by two ships of war. His
mission is the delimitation of 
the Northern frontier of the
Portuguese possessions in
East Africa.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant,
Seth A. Pratt.<br/>
U.S. Consul.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">This market has for some time
been over-supplied with quantities
of English and Indian goods.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">American Imports.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The imports from the United
States may be said to consist
nominally of Refined Petroleum,
Unbleached Cotton and Soap.
These being the staples handled
by the American houses engaged
in this trade.  The former
of these by its phenomenal cheapness
has completely taken the
place of the vegetable oils, which
in former times were used
exclusively for illuminating
purposes.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Can[?]</span> petroleum is often sold in 
this market as low as one dollar
and a quarter. United States 
Currency. which fact would not
command it to the serious
consideration of exporters in 
America. The yearly consumption
of East Africa -- Zanzibar
being the distributing point --
is upwards of 75,000 cases.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">American cottons have for
many years been the standards
in this market but their
use has been much curtailed
within the past ten years by
the introduction of the cottons
manufactured in India.

<span class="hr"> </span>

Standard thirty-six inch sheetings
cannot be sold here at
better than five rupees per 
piece of thirty yards.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Brine[?]</span> Soap commands a 
ready sale but at unremunerative
prices.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Besides the foregoing a 
limited business is done in
Bleached Cotton, Biscuits, Lumber.
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Bar[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Shacks[?]</span>, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Hoop[?]</span> Iron, Nails,
Resin, and Turpentine.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As is usually the case, the
imports from the United States 
for the past year are very
small in comparison to 
the exports for the same
period.</p>
