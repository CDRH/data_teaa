      <p class="tei_p">Gaboon Nov. 26th 1866</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Monsieur the Commandant Superior 
of the French settlements,
West Coast of Africa </p>
      <p class="tei_p">We the undersigned merchants 
established at Gaboon having been 
made acquirable with the circular 
which was addressed to us by your 
order on the 16th of this month, and 
in accordance with your invitation
to us to forward to you our observations 
on the occasion of our visit to you 
on the 24th of September last on 
the subject of the circular dated 
the 21st of the same month.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Have the honor to state to you
that which follows.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The mercantile community of 
Gaboon was painfully impressed 
on learning by the announcement 
contained in your first circular
that the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">mother[?]</span> country having 
thought proper to reduce the local

<span class="hr"> </span>
 
expenses you should deem it necessary 
to make it support the amount of 
this reduction, commencing by causing
us to pay for licences, which we consider 
to be very high if compared to those
paid in France where trade is so much 
more important than here.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That moreover when we established 
ourselves at Gaboon we were far 
from forseeing that so sudden a 
change would one day come upon 
us and in a manners so burdensome
we were so much the further from 
supposing it, seeing that the country 
is one of the poorest and most 
unhealthy of the Coast of Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">With regard to the second circular 
relative to the duties to be imposed 
at a later date upon the Importations
and Exportations of merchandise 
we can only repeat to 
you that which we have said
before with regard to the licences
that the mercantile community 
is totally unable to bear any of 

<span class="hr"> </span>

these expenses, and this you will 
perfectly understand by the statement
which we <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> to forward to 
you.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Barwood the principal return 
cargo does not pay freight, this is 
easily seen, the present selling price 
in France being 75 to 85 francs at 
most per ton.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Ebony is but of <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">slow[?]</span> sale, after 
being kept a long time in warehouses 
and consequently after heavy expences.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">India Rubber becomes daily scarcer,
and even may be said to be 
disappearing entirely, besides this 
it sustains great loss of weight,
it is nevertheless the most important 
article.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Ivory is purchased at a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>
rate here than in Europe, consequently 
the profit denied from it is very 
small, and consists only in the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> 
made in <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> the goods.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Beeswax, this product is so scarce 
that it may be considered as exhausted.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">To all this we have to add that 
living becomes harder daily, fresh 
provisions being wanting so to speak,
moreover we cannot do otherwise 
than draw your attention to the 
enormous losses which we sustain 
by the frequent plundering of 
our boats, and this in spite of 
your good will. As to the trust 
given to the natives, we will not
enlarge on that subject, and yet 
you are perfectly aware that those 
advances once made may be 
considered as three fourth lost.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That circular also containes several
articles relative to the keeping of our 
Books, on this lead we will beg you 
to notice that in a country where one 
can remain but a short time, and 
is often ill, it is impossible to keep 
accounts as regularly as in France.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In addition, profiting by this opportunity,
we think that we ought to 
draw your attention to the fact,
that the formalities to be fulfilled

<span class="hr"> </span>

becomes daily more complicated, 
thus we are obliged before commencing 
the unloading or leading 
of a vessel to obtain a permit at 
the cost of a franc. There appears 
to us <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> necessity for the existence 
of this permit in a country where
until now, the authorities having 
nothing to gain thereby has never 
occupied itself with this kind of 
operation this measure occasioning 
some time a delay cannot 
but be prejudicial to us.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hoping Monsieur the Commandant 
that you will be pleased 
to take into consideration the 
different observations which we 
have the honor to address to 
you, and that in your high 
sense of Justice you will recognise 
the impossibility of 
insisting upon the execution 
of the said circular of Sept 
21st and Nov 16th.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We have the honor to be

<span class="hr"> </span>
 
Your very humble and 
very obedient Servants.</p>
