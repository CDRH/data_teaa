      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon.<br/>
Secretary of State.<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I had the honor to address
you on the 15th August 86 from
Zanzibar asking an allowance
of $500 for making a treaty with
the Sultan. On the 28th Feb. 86 you
replied that there was no authority
of law to make an allowance</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I had hoped as the claim was just 
something would be allowed me. I went
to considerable expense to get the treaty
through quickly which I could not
afford out of $1000 per annum salary.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The climate of Zanzibar is a very
trying one for whitemen and my
health has been impaired by a residence
there. I take the liberty to ask of the
Hon. Secretary that some consideration
of my care will be taken.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
F. M. Cheney<br/>
Late U.S. Consul Zanzibar</p>
