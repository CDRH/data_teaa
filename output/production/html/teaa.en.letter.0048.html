      <p class="tei_p">July 31/63<br/>
Commercial Agency of the United States<br/>
at St Paul De Loanda</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour of advising you
of my arrival at my Post of Duty on the 15th
day of July 1863. After a passage (by sea) of
Sixty Days, and ten days occupied in transit
between my Place of Residence (Havre De Grace Md.)
and detention in Boston Harbor by contrary
minds, the latter occupying nine days, makeing
in all Seventy Days transit;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have drawn upon the Hon Secretary of
the Treasury for the amount due me for transit
viz $217.56. being obliged to allow 15 pr cent
upon the face of the Draft, netting me $186.93
the net amount due me after deducting $2.28
for internal revenue tax, and $3.00 for Passport
forgotten while in Washington;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was unable to wait upon his Exelency
"Sr. Jos√© Baptista D' Andrade" Governor
General of the Province of Angola, until the 30th
of July, in consequence of formalities necessary
to be observed;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Having complied with the customary
Etiquette of the Country, on the said 30th of July,
I called upon his excellency, accompanied by
John G. Willis, Esq. and Snr. Francisco Antonio Flores
as interpreter and presented my commission
for his inspection, he was entirely satisfied
that it was Genuine.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">But it having been customary for Agts
here to be furnished with an Exequatur, in accordance
with the 10th article of the Treaty of 1840. He
could not recognize me in the official "Boletin

<span class="tei_gap_reason_missing tei_gap_extent_1 tei_gap_extent_page tei_gap">[illegible]</span>



furniture viz Chairs, settee, &amp;c. and a book
case or "Escritoir" obtained by me by Receipting
for it to Mr Willis (a copy enclosed) for
the purpose of keeping the Archives and Books
belonging to this agency safe;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The said property was in possession
of Mr Birney, formerly U. States Naval Store
keeper here, left with Mr Cunningham by
Mr Birney as property of the United States, and
by him left with Mr Willis, each of the
last named Gentlemen giving their receipts
to their predisessors for the property;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When I presented the Order of your
Honour upon Mr Cunningham for articles in
his possession, to Mr Willis, I called his
attention to the latter clause of said Order
namely "and all other property in your possession
belonging to the United States" Mr. Willis
informed me that the said property was not
intended to be included by said order, because
it is property under the exclusive control of
the Navy Department;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Not being prepared in the absense of
instructions in the premises to controvert this
position, I leave it; simply calling the
attention of the Department to the facts, to the
end that in case it was the intention to place
said property in my possession, that neither
my Bondsmen or myself be held responsible
for it, inasmuch as the said property is
not now, or ever has been in my possession;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I beg leave to call your attention
to a custom (or Practice) that has obtained here,
regarding the place of Deposit of Ships Papers,



namely by Sec 479 manuel of 1863 it is made
the Duty of every Master of an American Vessel
to deposit the papers (ships Papers) with the Consular
Officer, and in default heavy Penalties;
but here the ships papers are retained by the
Custom House authorities, consequently no
Consular Certificates (as per instructions) can
be given;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Willis assures me that he has attempted
to induce an abandonment of said practice.
but without effect, and from present information
upon the subject, I am induced to believe that
the services of one having higher powers than
myself, (probably our Minister to Portugal) is
necessary to accomplish the desired reformation
and enable ship masters and Commercial agents
to comply with the United States Law;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By schedule no 1 (herewith enclosed) it
will be perceived that this Post has no Books
of Record as required by sections 391-392 of
manuel of 1863. Consequently the Records are 
upon unbound detached peices of paper, very 
liable to loss by accident;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Other articles also are much needed as
per enclosed schedule No 3. Please send them
as soon as practicable, the agency being
absolutely destitute of them;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Willis informs me that he has
received notice that a box containing a 
flag and other articles has been sent to this
Post via New York, but it has not been
received here, and it is probably now lying
in that City or entirely lost</p>

      <p class="tei_p">There is no certain way by which articles



intended for this Post can be sent, except via
Salem Mass, Care of R Brookhouse &amp; co, and 
viz England, Care of U.S. Consul of St Helena
and via Lisbon, care of U.S. Consul at
Lisbon, no vessels sail from the U.S.
Direct to this Port, except from Salem Mass
and occasionally one from Boston;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the Honour of informing your that
it has been and is now the Custom at this Port
for Oaths to be administered by the Commercial
Agents to Citizens of the United States;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By Circular No 8 of Feb 21st 1863, directed
to me; and by Art <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">1st[?]</span> of said Circular, I understand
that I am instructed to render an account
for office Rent to the amount attained by General
instructions, namely, 10 per cent on the amount of
salary which I am thankful for; inasmuch as
the salary allowed is barely adequate to a
support;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Not being engaged in trade of any kind
the room occupied by me is used exclusively
for the business of the agency;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It gives me much pleasure to acknowledge
the kindness of John G. Willis Esq in
affording me every desireable facility for
transacting the business of the agency;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With much Respect<br/>
I have the Honour to be<br/>
Yours Most Obed<br/>
John T. Bradberry<br/>
