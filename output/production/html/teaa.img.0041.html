<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>In 1918, Claude A. Barnett (known for having founded the Associated Negro Press two years earlier) established The Kashmir Chemical Company, a black-owned beauty products company targeting African American women as its consumers. The company later re-launched as Nile Queen, using iconography in their advertisements and packaging inspired by the then-current "Egyptomania." These advertisements were placed in <em>The Crisis</em> magazine, the organ of the NAACP edited by W. E. B. Du Bois, among other periodicals. Cleopatra and Sheba, queens of ancient Egypt and Ethiopia respectively&#x2014;representing both ends of the Nile&#x2014;appear in the advertisements as fantastic regal aspirations for the modern African American woman. In addition, all of these advertisements depict a glamorous, aspirational consumer in her boudoir flanked by a servant.</p>

<p>The servant-consumer pairing is most fantastical and counterintuitive in the April 1921 advertisement. The modern woman is assisted by a "Nile Queen," possibly Cleopatra, traveling through time to supply the former with cosmetics. A pamphlet published by the Kashmir Chemical Company claimed that the company's products were crafted "after the famous Cleopatra formulas."
