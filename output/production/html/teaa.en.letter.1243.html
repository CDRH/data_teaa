      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of
your dispatch No. 5, July
15, 1898, with Inclosure of
a letter and petition of
Pet. A. W. Renner Esq. of Cape
Coast Castle; with thanks,
for consideration &amp; c.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Your dispatch reached
me, Aug. 27, 1898. In reply
to which I most respectfully
refer you to my
dispatch No. 21, Aug. 11,
1898, to Department of State.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In reply to your
instruction, that I report

<span class="hr"> </span>

upon, the necessity of a further
continuation of the Agency, at
Cape Coast Castle; would
say, first, that the Gold Coast
Colony, Africa, of which Accra
is the Capital, is a British
possession; and according to
Walker's Almanac of
British possessions, in Africa,
Cape Coast Castle has a
population of 11,614, while
Elmina, the home of the late
George E. Eminsang, has a
population of 10,530, hence,
from the population of the
two cities, must of necessity,
command a considerable
commercial entercourse.
As to the matter of trade from
the Gold Coast, to the United 
States, it seems to have been
greatly neglected. And until
it shall have been properly,
worked up, I would probably
be premature, in recommending
recommending

<span class="hr"> </span>

recommending a discontinuation
of the Agency. I would, therefore,
the rather, recommend, that
said Agency, be continued,
until opportunity enables me
to learn more of the place, or
proper attention and arrangements,
by American merchants,
shall have been more fully
made, in order, to increase
exports to, and emports from
the United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As to the application of Pet. A. W.
Renner Esq. for the Commercial
Agency at Cape Coast
Castle, I learn, by inquiry,
that he is a Sierra Leonean, 
a man of much ability,
but for some cause was
for some time disbarred
from practice, but has
subsequently been restored.
Secondly; As it is now
currently circulated, here, that
peace has been declared,
between

<span class="hr"> </span>

between the United States and
Spain, it will doubtless,
give an opportunity for
American vessels, to again,
with the Coasts of Africa, the
better enabling us to decide
upon the necessity of the Agency.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Thirdly: I will say <span class="underline">incidentally</span>
         <span class="underline">as</span>
         <span class="underline">well</span>
         <span class="underline">as</span>
         <span class="underline">confidentially</span>, that judging from 
an informed interview,
believes the Secretary of
State – Monrovia, and
myself, on the 26, instant,
I am led to believe that
it will soon be my privilege,
as well as duty, to 
communicate to the 
Department of State – Washington,
the expressed desire of the
Liberian Government, to have
the Government of the United 
States, to extend a protectorate
over the Liberian Republic!
And

<span class="hr"> </span>

And, in the event, that the
American Government,
accedes to such a request;
as American goods and
manufactures, have, even
now, quite a demand, in 
Liberian markets; and as
both the Liberian merchant
and farmer, are very
anxious to open up a market,
in America, for the exchange
of their products; as
an evidence of which, I have
already succeded
in securing several
consignments of Liberian
productions, to New York,
Baltimore, and Boston:
notwithstanding, these products
had to be shipped,
by way of Liverpool, 
owing to existing
hostilities between the United 
States and Spain.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Upon the cessation
of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of these hostilities; and the return 
of peace; when shipping, 
by American vessels, can again,
be resumed, without fear of
being seized, by enemies'
ships; it is more than probable
that such a protectorate
would be the means of a
more extended commercial 
entercourse, between
the United States and Liberia:
thus necessitating not only,
the retention of the Agency,
at Cape Coast Castle, but 
possible, the establishment of
one at Accra, the Capital
of the Gold Coast Colony,
with a population of 16,276,
as well as at Sinoe, Harper, 
Cape Palmas, and the restoration
of the Agency, at Grand 
Bassa, Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Awaiting further 
developments of affairs, between 
the two Governments,
I

<span class="hr"> </span>

I do not, at this writing,
feel myself, justified to 
recommend a discontinuation
of the Cape Coast 
Castle Agency.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be your obedient 
servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith</p>
      <p class="tei_p">P.S. My dispatch – No. 21,
Aug, 11, 1898, to Department 
of State should have been
Consular Series, 
No. 1.<br/>
