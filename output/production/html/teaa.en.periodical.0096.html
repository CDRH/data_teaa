            <h3>Analysis</h3>

            <p class="tei_p">A non-parodic response to "The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands" (1899), W. E. B. Du Bois's "The Burden of Black Women" opposes Rudyard Kipling's paean to the imperial mission and assertion of Anglo-Saxon superiority with a powerful counter-myth of particular relevance for Blacks in the U.S. Published in four distinct versions (in the November 1907 issue of <em class="hi">Horizon</em>, the November 1914 issue of <em class="hi">The Crisis</em>, <em class="hi">Darkwater</em> in 1920, and <em class="hi">The ABC of Color</em> in 1963), the sixty-four line, eight-stanza poem (in its initial iteration) depicts Africa and the diaspora as a woman who has long suffered under "the burden of white men" but whose resurrection will awaken and transform the entire world. Its major sections roughly correspond to the thesis-antithesis-synthesis pattern critics have noted in other writings by Du Bois. Moving beyond and reconciling the lamentation of the brief initial section and the bitterness of the lengthy second, the ten lines that make up the third offer a glimpse of a harmonious new world free of exploitation.</p>
