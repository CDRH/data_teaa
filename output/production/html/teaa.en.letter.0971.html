And should it appear to the Legislature that the person or persons thus petitioning has or have shown sufficient evidence of reformation and repentance, then and in that case the Legislature may by Joint Resolution, to be adopted by a two third vote of the members of each branch of the Legislature, restore and grant unto the person or persons petitioning, all the rights privileges and immunities guaranteed to all other good citizens. Resolved further, that this amendment to the Constitution of the Republic or Liberia pass each branch by a two third vote as required by the second section of Article II of the Constitution; and that the said amendment be submitted to the people for their vote at the biennial election to be held in May 1879 in the several counties of this Republic;
