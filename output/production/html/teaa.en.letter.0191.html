      <p class="tei_p">Legation of Liberia<br/>
Yonkers, N.Y. March 31st, 1870</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In Jany 1857, in answer to 
an application from me, for a U.S. 
Cruiser to visit Monrovia, Liberia,
as an uprising of the natives was
apprehended, and a combination of
of the various tribes was understood
or reported to be forming, for the
purpose of attacking the Liberian
settlements, I received a communication 
from the U.S. State Department,
under date of 5th February 1867, stating
that Admiral Goldsborough, commanding
the European Squadron had been in a instructed

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">to Honble Hamilton Fish<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington 
D.C.</span>



to direct the next cruiser sent by
him to the coast of Africa, to visit
Liberia.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Advices by telegraph from Paris
have appeared in the various papers,
stating that the Liberians were engaged
in war with the natives.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It has heretofore been reported, that
the natives have been incited to war
by English traders; and the late
humiliation of Liberia by English men
of war would naturally further encourage 
them to attack the settlements.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have heard no particulars,
but if not inconvenient, or inconsistent 
with other requirements, I respectfully 
ask that the same countenance
or support may be afforded as was
done in Feby 1857.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be, with
the highest consideration<br/>
Sir, Your obedient Servant<br/>
H. M. Schieffelin</p>
