Johanna 25 June 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Seth A Pratt Esqr<br/>
U.S. Consul<br/>
Zanzibar</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I last wrote to you on the 19th inst
and sent letters by the American Whaler
"Kathleen" and no doubt you have on this
received them. I however enclose press copies
of the same herewith. I wrote to you that
three Johannamen were on their way to you
to give their testimony and to be away from the
vengeance of the Sultan. One Dray man <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
has got as far as <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Comoro[?]</span> but the other two
Aloe Shi and Halliday Shi were arrested as they
were on the point of embarking in a canoe to go
on board of Capt Giffords vessel. They were imprisoned
for the night and in the morning taken before the
Sultan who abused and threatened them all he
knew how and will not permit any more vessels
leave in the night for fear they may get on boat
and get away and give evidence against him
These two men have <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> written statements what
I have had "Englishized" and at their request herewith 
enclose to you. It simply shows what



what means and devices this old tyrant
will use to further his own ends. The French
handle him pretty roughly at times but when
he demands pardon <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> all over and they
are as thick and happy as bees together <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
I am anxious to know how the
arbitrating business in my case is to be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
If the Resident and French Government
call their <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> a proper investigation I
do not and enter every point I have
demanded is given into I certainly protest
against it. Here the Resident calls any
one he chooses and asks any question he chooses
without my <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">knowing[?]</span> any thing about it
on an opportunity of refuting any false
statements: but so far as I can learn
they cannot bring one such thing against
me, although they would the affairs of
supplies to his brother which I think they
have given to that they have not a leg to stand
on there. They might as well accuse you as me.
But over there, that was not the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
of my grievances &amp; the serious ones too. His
brother only rebelled in 1884 &amp; my trouble date from
1882. If all works well here I intend going
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">hence[?]</span> on this business and I am glad we
have the Hon: J. G. Blane to the which <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
of the Hon. T. F. Bayard. I cannot imagine

<span class="hr"> </span>

the Hon. Mr Bayard <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_four tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
a treaty as the French have here. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Apparently[?]</span>
they are not responsible for anything and
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_three tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> hold the Sultan responsible.
I have been writing to the Resident about
the salve trade treaty here with the English and
requested a reply to my letter but he would
not write but came out to see me. He did not
recognize the English treaty at all. He says they
have made a treaty since which holds the slave
five years longer &amp;c. Of course the English
Consul at Zanzibar will know about this
and I wish you would call upon on this matter.
According to the English treaty all slaves are
to be absolutely free in August next, French
say free yes but they must work for their
masters five years <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">more[?]</span> and then engage
for another five years!! I think "<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Extra[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>"
will grow under that business. Anyone
can buy a slaves labour now for 150 <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">francs[?]</span> for
five years if he wishes. I would like to
know the English opinion of it. Of course
slaves are bought and sold here daily and have been
ever since the English Treaty and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_four tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
French have "the ball". They say the English have
not <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_about tei_unclear_extent_five tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> of the treaty.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hoping to hear from you soon &amp; <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">patiently[?]</span>
         <br/>
I am your obedient servant
B. F. Wilson</p>

Johanna 29 July 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Seth A. Pratt Esqr<br/>
U.S. Consul<br/>
Zanzibar</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your two valuable favors of the
dates 31st May and 2nd July duly to hand
by this months courrier. The U.S.S. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
was too late to be of any service as regards the
enquiry and I do not know but it is all
for the best that there was no vessel here or
no representant of my Government. I never
feared any thing but false statements and
lies and my only reason for <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">wanting[?]</span> a
word myself on a U.S. Government Official
that could prove that but as they have had
all their own way they cannot surely
find any fault. The only thing I
fear now is that the U.S. Government will
be too <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> and not <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">back[?]</span> my claim.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I received a letter from Baron <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_or tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> by
the last mail. (a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Persian[?]</span>) He says that
my Government have not proved my claim
and they will have to if I am <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>.
Do you think I should go home for
that purpose? It is now <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_or tei_unclear_extent_three tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>



and I would not like to leave here unless
necessary. Still I could do so. I could
only relate some facts and important ones
which perhaps have not been written but if
the U.S. Government observe well all that has
been sent to the Department of State since 1884
they will have my case pretty well. I know
the French Government will wish to get out of
it by saying the King cannot pay. He has nothing
they say. He could have paid and would
have paid if the French had kept out of these
islands. I consider now that they are
responsible for the Sultan and I have good
French Authority also for saying this. His
action is political and they are responsible.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am astonished that the U.S. Government
and the English Government also did not
object from the first to one or two Articles
in their Treaty of the Protectorate. Perhaps they
have. Certainly Mr. Blaine will bring
them to their hearings.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">You no doubt have had the "<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>" with
you on this. It does ones' heart good
to see an American man of war: They
are altogether too rare.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hoping to hear good news
from you and the Department of State<br/>
I am Your obedient servant<br/>
B. F. Wilson</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I Aloe Shi Dreyman do hereby swear by the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Koran[?]</span> that
I went to French Resident of Johanna three
days in succession and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> three different
times to give my testimony while he was making the
enquiry. I went to tell what I know that Sultan
Abdallah had done to Dr. Wilson and these times
I was acompanied by Halliday Shi. On the third
day the Resident told us he would not take our statements
at all. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">About[?]</span> the same time he was taking the
statements of men who Sultan Abdallah sent. We
came to the conclusion (Halliday and myself) that we
would go to Zanzibar and make our statements there
and intended to letter passage in the vessel of Capt
Gifford ("Kathleen") but were taken and imprisoned
by the Police of the Sultan and kept in prison until morning
when we were taken before the Sultan. who said to 
us "you wish to run away and go to sea". The reason
that we wished to go to Zanzibar was that the Sultan
sent to me one Said Omar and told me that
I must go before the Resident and swear that
the Doctor agreed to give me three thousand dollars
if I would be witness for him. I informed this
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">morning[?]</span> that I could not tell such a lie about the
Doctor but he the Sultan should go and tell this to the Resident <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_three tei_unclear_extent_lines tei_unclear">[?]</span>



one hundred and twenty six dollars and if the
American Government does not <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> well this
Sultan will kill us. He told me also that he would not
allow me to go to Patsy to Dr Wilson, and I want the
U.S. Consul to know all of this.</p>
