      <p class="tei_p">St. Paul de Loanda<br/> 
14 June 1883<br/>
To the Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour to lay 
before the Department of State the 
following circumstances connected
with the discharge of my duties as 
Vice Consul for the United States at
this port.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr: L de R du Verge left
Loanda for the Congo on the 16th
ultimo by the Portuguese mail steamer
for the purpose, it is reported, of
arranging with Mr: Stanley the
details of the duties of a post he has
accepted under the Belgian Expedition
without handing over to me the archives
of the Consulate or acquainting me
as to whether I should be able to 
have access to any documents or
forms which might be required,
although I saw that officer on the
day of his departure.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Had there been no immediate con-
sular

<span class="hr"> </span>

con-

sular duties to perform I should have waited
the return of Mr: du Verge for an explanation,
and also for an explanation in a matter
of a personal nature which has recently
come to light.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The facts of the case are these: On
the arrival on the 3rd instant of the
wrecked crew of the American whaler
"Merlin", lost South of Mossamedes,
I called at the house of Mr <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">T.[?]</span> Mark, 
a Swiss, holding a Dry Goods retailed
shop, where Mr: Du Verge has hired a
room as his residence and office. Mr:
Mark who possesses the key gave me permission 
to enter but would not permit
me to take the Ships Register as the
Archives, he said, were left in his charge,
and I am unable to register my correspondence 
in the proper official book which 
appeared to be locked away.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Wishing to take to my office the
Ships Register did not appear to me any
infraction of the Rules, or had Mr. Mark
any official right or authority to interfere
with me, for in the first place the room
offered no facilities, for writing and in the 

<span class="hr"> </span>

Second I could not without great
inconvenience to myself obtain the
assistance of my mercantile clerks
to write up the Register.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">That Mr. Mark, who does not
possess the highest reputation for
soberness or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the archives 
and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> my actions over
them, shows a want of official consideration 
by Mr: du Verge, and moreover
contrary to the consular instructions.
Under these circumstances and not possessing 
the key of the room, no responsibility 
can be attached to me for the
safety of the consular papers but I shall
endeavour to exercise such supervision
over them as is consistent with my
relations with Mr: Mark.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It may be inferred that there
exists a difference between Mr du Verge
and myself but such is not the case,
if his friendly pretensions are to be considered 
as a proof of his sincerity, and I 
am quite at a loss to understand what 
motive he has to pass me over in matters

<span class="hr"> </span>

appertaining to the consulate, with
which I have been connected for a long
period, having been appointed to my
present position since 1868, and for 
many years have been in sole charge
of the office, without, I venture to state
giving the Department any cause of 
complaint or in any way failed to 
discharge the duties faithfully and 
conscientiously.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I may also state that my long 
residence here as Merchant, and
holding the post of British Vice
Consul which I presume is not incompatible 
with my position as United 
States Vice Consul, give me a status
that facilitates considerably the settlement
of consular business with the local
authorities with whom I have always 
been on the most friendly and intimate 
relationship.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The information that has been given
me regarding myself personally is that
Mr: Mark has failed to obtain any one
here to sign a bond for him to be Vice
Consul at Loanda from which I infer 
that

<span class="hr"> </span>

that Mr: du Verge has applied to the 
Department to have me substituted,
but on what ground I am unable
to say.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In submitting the foregoing
matter for the information of the 
Department, I have the honour to
request that should there be no
reason why I should not continue
to hold the post of Vice Consul, that
Mr. du Verge should be instructed
to consign the Archives of the Consulate 
to my charge whenever he
may absent himself, and should
it be deemed expedient, to call 
upon him to explain his reasons for
showing such discourtesy to me and
am not his inferior save in Official
rank.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most obedient servant<br/>
Robt S. Newton<br/>
U.S. Vice Consul</p>
