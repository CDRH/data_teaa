lamented loss we and the Madagascar people
experience in the death of Her Majesty Ranavalona II
which took place on the 10th Alohotsy (13th July)
after a long severe illness. By Her late Majesty's
order given out during Her Reign and by the 
consent of the people we succeed Her as
Queen of Madagascar. We assure your Excellency 
that our earnest desire is to be in good 
friendship with you and that our subjects and 
the American Citizens hold a friendly relation 
thereby to increase Commerce and promote civilization.
The Treaties of Peace and Commerce
which exist between our respective countries 
remain unchanged. Given at our Court Masoandro, 
on the 18th Alohotsy (21st July), in the year
of our Lord, and in the first year of our reign</p>
