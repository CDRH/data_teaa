      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
at St. Paul de Loanda November 21, 1891</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In accordance with your instruction
No. 3, of March 19, 1891, I have the honor
to submit to your approval my nomination
of Rev. Lancaster C. Burling, as Vice 
Commercial Agent, or as Vice-Consul, at 
this port.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The nominee is an American Citizen,
of age, an ordained minister of the M. 
E. Church of America and has been two
years at Loanda, as a missionary connected 
with Bishop W. Taylor's mission</p>

      <p class="tei_p">These facts will, I hope, be considered
sufficient evidence that the candidate
is qualified for the office.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As the Portuguese authorities are so much
inclined to see political agents in all
foreign missionaries, I would have preferred

<span class="hr"> </span>

 a layman; but, there being no other
American available, I had no choice.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As for my reasons in not re-nominating
Mr. Bannister, the principal one is the 
violent hatred of the Portuguese for all 
Englishmen and all that is English, which
makes it unwise to have an Englishman
represent the United States. Then, according
to Regulations, an American, when equally 
qualified, is to be preferred to an alien.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/> 
Your obedient servant<br/>
Heli Chatelain
U.S. Coml Agent</p>

      <p class="tei_p">P.S. The exequatur of my appointment 
as Commercial Agent and that
of Mr. Bannister as Vice-Consul, have
at length come and will be presented
to the Governor General on his return from
the South of the Province.</p>
