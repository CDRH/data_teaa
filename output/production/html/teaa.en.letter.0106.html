St. Paul de Loanda 12th Decr 1876</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to request
the Department the favor to send
to the Commercial Agency two
National flags, of a large size say
15 ft. by 10 ft.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As it is customary here to 
hoist all consulate flags on Sundays
and all public holidays; those now
in use at this Agency are considerably
worn. A large flag is necessary
on account of the height of the flag
staff at my residence
Messrs

Messrs Yates and Porterfield of 
New York have often vessels to 
Gaboon which would be a good way
to send them as there are two
steamers a month from that port 
to this</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Your most obedient Servant<br/>
Robt S. Newton<br/>
Vice Commercial Agent</p>
