      <h3>The Congo Slave State.</h3>

         <p class="tei_p">On page 10, it is written: "It has been stated above that this is an appeal to
the people of the civilized world, whose representatives
signed the Berlin and Brussels Acts. But it is also an
appeal to the American public, whose Government did not
ratify those Acts," etc.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The American Government did not ratify the Berlin Act, but it
did ratify the Brussels Act. The appeal to the American public rests,
therefore, on even stronger grounds than those urged in the pamphlet.</p>

         <h4>Preface.</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">In the days of the over-sea slave trade, Europeans went down the 
West Coast of Africa to capture the inhabitants and carry them
away to labour on European and American plantations, and for other
purposes. That wickedness was put an end to by a few men, who,
after incredible difficulty, heart-breaking set-backs and soul-tearing
toil, with pen and voice succeeded in rousing the conscience of the
world. An evil perhaps as great-possibly greater-and accompanied
by concomitant dangers which the over-sea slave trade was
innocent of, faces us to-day. Although the present evil is not so
universally practised as was the other, it wields nevertheless, a corrupting
influence upon men's minds, its perpetration being accompanied
by temporary material gains of an extensive kind-much
more extensive than the profits derived from the over-sea slave
trade-which gains, moreover, are unaccompanied by any hardship
or unpleasantness to the principal beneficiaries concerned in promoting
and enforcing the evil. The consequence has been that within
the last few years the virus has spread, a pernicious example has
been copied, the minds of many men are confused and, as in the
days of the over-sea slave trade, familiarity with an existing evil
has resulted in the blunting of conscience, in indifferentism and
unthinking acquiescence.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">One hundred years ago, a handful of men were fighting a system
hoary with age and sanctified by custom, whereby the negro was
considered the lawful prey of the white man, who, thanks to his
superior engines of destruction, and to the inter-tribal warfare among
the negroes, captured enormous numbers of the latter and enslaved
them in a land of exile.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">To-day, some of us are fighting a system whereby a certain
number of individuals in a small country, having at their head a
man utterly unscrupulous but extraordinarily able, consider the negro
as their lawful prey, and, thanks to the perfection which modern
engines of destruction have now attained and to the lack of unity
among the negroes, are enslaving them in their own land.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The men of a century ago had for a long time, everything against
them: Parliament, class prejudice, vested interests, and much more,
beside of which the difficulties that face us to-day are insignificant.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We are confronted merely with the intrigues of a clique, the allies
bound to it by the ties of material interest, and the paid agents it
entertains. We are not struggling against a system to which long
usage has given almost the force of law, but against a system adopted
in violation of solemn international pledges, and which has been in
existence for little more than a decade. We are not contending with
a system which might have endured for a thousand years without
the Nemesis of retribution, but with a system which carries within
it the germs of destruction and chaos.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Yet, disproportionate as are our difficulties with those which faced
the men of a hundred years ago, the obstacles we have to overcome
are, nevertheless, considerable. If the honour of the nations of the
world is concerned in this matter, so also are their mutual jealousies
involved. The partition of Africa has given rise to much rivalry, to
dangerous disputes almost culminating in armed warfare between the
nations of Europe. Deeds have been done in Africa, of which each
participating Power in the "scramble" feels ashamed, and this
feeling of shame, coupled with distrust of its neighbour, causes each
Power to hesitate before taking action, leads the timid statesman to
shrink, to search for excuses, to palliate-almost to condone. Public
opinion is still suffering, although in a lessening degree, perhaps, from
one of those periodical waves of materialism and indifferentism which
sweep over the intellectual world from time to time, when appeals to
humanity are put down to sentimental clap-trap, or to the deluded
imaginings of ill-regulated minds. But what movement for reform,
what effort to undo a wrong, or to upset a tyranny has ever been
carried to a successful conclusion without impediments and
opposition? Rather should we rejoice that so many powerful
sympathies are already enlisted in the cause.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Those whom appeals to humanity leave untouched, we are able,
happily, to approach on other grounds, to put before them arguments
and data based upon the severest practicability, upon the clearest
common-sense, upon considerations of science and reason which will
bear-and have borne-the test of examination. We can produce
sufficient presumptive evidence to show that the continuation and
spread of this evil will bring with it, as inevitably as night follows
day, ruin and disaster upon every legitimate European enterprise
in Equatorial Africa; will undo the work of years of patient effort;
will render valueless the sacrifice of many valuable lives laid down
in the task of exploring and opening up those vast regions, and will
fling back their inhabitants into the welter of barbarism, deeper and
infinitely more degrading than any they have hitherto experienced.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The men of a hundred years ago, who fought the over-sea
African slave trade, were giants. The obstacles they had to surmount
were colossal. They surmounted them-they won. Compared
with them, the men who to-day are fighting the New Slavery in Africa
are pygmies. Their difficulties are substantial, but they will overcome
them — and they will win.</p>

         <h4>Introduction.</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">A few weeks ago I suggested to a friend who, although entirely
unconnected with Congo affairs, shares nevertheless the feelings
of indignation entertained by all impartial observers at the monstrous
abuses of which the Congo Basin has become the scene, the publication
of a pamphlet dealing with the subject, which I volunteered to write
and compile, if he would defray the cost of printing and distribution.
This he generously agreed to do. I can only hope that what is written
in these pages may help the determined efforts now being made to
rouse the public conscience of the world to the abuses which, under
the cloak of a detestable hypocrisy, maintained by every political
and personal intrigue that ingenuity can suggest, are befouling the
honour of the white races in Equatorial Africa, and building up a
heritage of trouble of which no man can foretell the consequences or
the end.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">This pamphlet — which is for gratis distribution only-is in
effect an appeal to the people of the civilized world, whose
representatives signed the Berlin Act of 1885, and the Brussels
Act of 1890, to unite in putting pressure upon their respective
Governments to take the territories known as the Congo State
out of the hands of King Leopold II, now dictator over a million
square miles in Africa, inhabited by twenty million negroes; and
by such measures as may be decided upon at a new Conference, to
ensure that the provisions of the Berlin and Brussels Acts shall be
effectively carried out in those territories.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">No attempt is herein made to recount the historical incidents
relating to the foundation of the State, nor to recapitulate the authenticated
stories of persistent cruelty and oppression which have
characterised its career more or less since its birth, but especially
since its policy of land appropriation, and appropriation, of the produce
of the soil was put into practice-that is to say, since 1891. That
task has been fully and admirably performed by Mr. H. R. Fox-Bourne,
Secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society in his volume
published this year, "Civilisation in Congo-land."<span class="sup">1</span>
         </p>
         <p class="tei_p">The object aimed at here has been twofold: (1) The presentation
in a lucid and easily readable form of the cardinal features which
underlie the new system of African slavery, conceived and applied
in the territories of the Congo Basin by the Sovereign of the Congo
State, thus centralising in a few pages the exposure of that system
which the author has already attempted; in the volumes published
by Mr. Heinemann in December of last and May of this year, entitled
respectively "Affairs of West Africa,"<span class="sup">2</span> and the "British Case in
French Congo."<span class="sup">3</span>
         </p>
         <p class="tei_p">(2) The treatment, in distinct chapters, of the Domaine Privé,
the Domaine de la Couronne, and each of the great Trusts into which
the Domaine Privé is sub-divided, accompanied in every case by maps
with the specific areas marked upon them, and by a narrative of the
more recent events which are available, or have been chronicled, from
those specific areas.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The author ventures to hope that, by this method of treatment,
the reader may have no difficulty in getting at the bed-rock facts
of the situation.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Every effort has been made to deal with the subject as temperately
as the author's feelings admit, but no apology is tendered to
those whose sensitiveness will not allow that a spade should under
any circumstances be described otherwise than as an agricultural
implement. The use of kid gloves and undiluted rose water can be left
to the diplomatists who for eleven years have sat still and not moved
a little finger while the Congo Basin was in process of being formed
into a charnel house, and who have only been roused from their apathy
within the last few weeks by strong speaking and straight writing — 
notwithstanding the fact, that in the Foreign Offices of England,
Germany and France, reports are pigeon-holed which confirm in
every particular the charges made against the Congo State for years
past, by all who have had an opportunity of studying the effects of
its system on the spot.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The British Government, in the face of a unanimous House of
Commons, has now promised to approach the signatory Powers, but
there is some reason to fear that if constant pressure is not brought
to bear upon the authorities, both inside the House and out of it,
the "enquiry" will only be a half-hearted sort of affair. It is of
the utmost importance, therefore, that public opinion throughout
the world should be brought to understand this question. This
pamphlet is a humble attempt to that end.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It has been stated above that this is an appeal to the people of the
civilized world, whose representatives signed the Berlin and Brussels
Acts. But it is also an appeal to the American public, whose Government
did not ratify those Acts, but which has a peculiar and very
special responsibility in the matter, inasmuch as the American Government
was the first to recognise the status of the International
Association (which subsequently became the Congo State) and
thereby paved the way for similar action on the part of the European
Governments. America was deceived, as Europe was deceived, by
the professions of philanthropy and high moral purpose so lavishly
scattered by the Sovereign of the Congo State. It is to be hoped that
President Roosevelt and the American people may help to undo the
grievous wrong which was thereby unknowingly inflicted upon the
natives inhabiting the Congo Territories.</p>
