      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform the Department that
Lieut. Grandy's Congo Livingstone Expedition was at 
St. Salvador Congo River, on June 10th in good
health and that they were about to continue their
journey inland. They complain that the King
of the Congo has detained them at St. Salvador for
an unnecessary length of time.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Portuguese mail streamer "Bengo" from Lisbon
landed a few days since at Cabinda a German
Expedition on a scientific mission to explore
the interior of Africa and the sources of the 
Rivers Congo and Zambesi.</p>

Sir <br/>
Your most obedient Servant<br/>
