      <p class="tei_p">Sir.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Hon. H. L. Crusoe informed me a few days since that he has resigned the office of United States Commercial Agent at Grand Bassa, and that you are in charge of the Archives and, I suppose, acting incumbent of stat position.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">You would oblige me by informing my by Mail if you have received from the government at Washington an appointment to that office, and if so then have you been officially recognized in that capacity by the Government at Monrovia?</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the 16th of July, I wrote you a note of inquiry - having received information that you were appointed, or was acting as Commercial Agent at Bassa, asking information.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the same date, I also sent you a note relative to the whereabouts of one John Smith. I have not been honored with a reply to either of the above notes.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is very essential that both of these matters should be adjusted, as at least, it will save my having to come and make such inquiries at Bassa in propria persona.</p>
