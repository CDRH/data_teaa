Monrovia, Liberia<br/>
December 23rd 1881.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your No 7 of
October 28th and No 8 of the 7th ult., 
with enclosures, both of which were
delayed at the Leeward on account
the irregularity of the mail system
here.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Refering to the former, I have the
honor to say, that I entered into
a Contract with the Mr. Taylor, U.S.
Minister Resident, and Consul
General at Liberia, under date
of October 3rd last, a copy of
which was transmitted to the
Department of State at
Washington, in which I became responsible
for the safe custody and
security of the archives, despatches,
and property of the Legation at
Monrovia, and I was as firmly
bound to the Government

<span class="hr"> </span>

Government of the United States
as to Mr Taylor.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The contract will cease and be
at end immediately upon Mr
Taylor's return to Monrovia, which
according to his arrangement will
be in a fortnight, before the Bond
would reach you, were it forwarded
now. If Mr. Taylor shall see
fit to appoint me Vice Consul
General, I shall be pleased to
forward any bond which may
be required of me.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Refering to your No 8, I have the
honor to say, that I transmitted
to the Liberian Government
immediately after receipt of yours, a
copy of the List of Liberians who
have died in the Isthmus of Panama,
from the 15th day of June 1887 to
the 18th day of October 1887, and informed
them of the probable increase
of death by longer exposure to the 
Malarial influence of the place.
I am requested by the Secretary

<span class="hr"> </span>

Secretary of State to convey to the
Government of the United States,
the thanks of the Republic of Liberia
for the important information.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have reason to believe that
actions will be taken by the Liberian
Government to prevent further
emigration of Liberians to the
Isthmus.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I take pleasure in forwarding
President Johnson's message
to the National Legislature, now
in session.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>

      <h3>Message of the President of Liberia Communicated to the First Session of the Twenty First Legislature.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Monrovia:<br/>
T. W. Howard, Printer<br/>
1887.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <div class="section">
         <h4>Message.</h4>
         <h4>To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives;–</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">In assembling for the transaction of the business of the
year, let us acknowledge, with unfeigned gratitude, the
Beneficent Providence who has thus far sustained us.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">With the exception of the most southern county, which
has suffered somewhat from an unusual drought, the economic
condition of the Republic remains nearly the same as
during the previous year.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Our relations with foreign powers continue on a friendly
footing.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The ratifications of the North West Boundary Treaty
between the Republic the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland, which, I informed you at the last session,
had not been exchanged, owing to the absence of Her
Majesty's representative from Sierra Leone, remain still
unexchanged, probably from the same cause.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In connection with the North West Boundary, I have to
state that the unsettled condition of things across and near the
line has influenced trade injuriously; and this injurious influence
has at time extended to the Liberian side. During the
month of April last, warlike tribes in British territory made
incursions into the British factories and settlements, and, after
plundering, drove before them some of the tribes, who fled
into the Liberian territory for protection. At one time it
was supposed that these warlike bands would cross the
boundary and invade the district of Robertsport, as they had
threatened to do. But the government of that district, having been
supplied with additional arms, appeared sufficiently strong to
have prevented even the attempt.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Republic has been invited to take part in the International
Exhibition to be held in Brussels next year. Our representative,
Baron Von Stein, having offered to supply and

<span class="hr"> </span>

conduct the Liberian department on his personal responsibility,
the Government has accepted the invitation.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Republic has also been invited to participate in the
Inernational Exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, next year.
It has also received an invitation to the International Exhibiton
to be held in Paris, in the year 1889.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Considering the limited revenue caused by the continued
fall in the prices of products; considering also the pressing
demands at home; owing also to the great distance and the
indirect way of transmitting products to the former country,
the Government was compelled to decline the former
invitation, and has not yet seen its way clear to accept the latter.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">While, in certain contingencies, governments do not participate
in these exhibitions, this does not preclude the practicability
or advisability of citizens representing the industry of
the country by exhibiting the fruits of their labor. The
advantages to be derived, by making known, in new markets,
the products of the country, and increasing the competition
for these, more than compensate for the little trouble
undergone in preparing them for exhibition.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Considerable speculation having been indulged in, in
reference to the emigration of laborers to Panama, I consider it
necessary to observe, that the Legislature of the Republic,
recognizing the right of citizens to sell their labor in the best
markets, enacted the Shippiug laws, with a view to protecting,
or setting safeguards around, a right always possessed
and always recognized.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The present government of the Republic has positively
refused to allow citizens to be transported, to engage in
foreign wars, although it has been alleged, by parties seeking
Liberian aid in this direction, that previous governments of
the Republic granted such permission,–a permission, you
will agree with me, altogether at variance with international
law, and conflicting with the interests of the country and
the dictates of humanity.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But in this case of employment of labor for peaceful purposes,
the Government saw no paramount interest of the
State warring against it. Its duty, then, was clear–to see
that safeguards set for the protection of the life, liberty and
property of the employed were duly observed.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Up to the present, it appears that the agents have acted in
conformity with the engagements entered into with the
Government, observing the Liberian laws and respecting the
integrity of the Liberian teritory.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The interest of the Government of the United States in
the prosperity and perpetuity of the Republic continues
unabated.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you his
financial report for the fiscal year. The depression of trade from

<span class="hr"> </span>

which the country, in common with others, has suffered for
several years, has been only partially removed. While
there has been a slight increase in the revenue and considerable
activity in some directions, not only have some prices remained
stationary, but the prices of one or two articles have
fallen even lower than the lowest point reached a year ago.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">To meet this difficulty, I do not recommend an increase in
the tariff. To insure trade and promote commerce, the tariff
laws should be based on equitable principles, and the
altered no more than necessary. To supply the lack caused by
the depression of trade, the general falling in prices, and
consequent limited revenue, and even to furnish
means beyond the ordinary requirements of the government
to develop additional branches of industry and enterprise
in the country, one important means is increasing the sources
of internal revenue.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The amount derived from capitation taxes is neither adequate
to the wants of the nation, nor commensurate with the population
of the country. But, in order to realize the reasonable
taxes that should be paid by the citizens, both civilized and
uncivilized, some more efficient system must be devised than
that followed for years; some system that would place the
collection of the taxes in the country under the control of a
few honest and responsible officers, instead of in the hands
of a host of irresponsible persons. With the present population
of the Republic, and with proper management, the capitation
tax of the country ought to be several times the
amount at present received.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">When it is known that some of the precious minerals are
within easy reach, more accessible than was formerly supposed,
as has been demonstrated by the discoveries of Hon. Benjamin
Anderson, the country sees a source from which might readily
be derived the means to satisfy its various necessities, and
relieve it of its burdens.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">With regard to this subject, a further communication will
be made to you.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But to accomplish the objects alluded to, another measure
becomes necessary. With a small revenue and an enormous
appropriation bill not only will the national debt be increasing,
but all hope of improvement will be precluded. The
remedy is at once apparent,–the expenses must be brought
within the income. It will then be practicable to pay salaries,
and to have a small surplus to assist in developing the
resources of the country.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">From the year 1860 to the present time, the officers and
attendants employed by the Legislature have increased by a
large percent.; while the pay of members is nearly threefold.
Certainly, the revenue has not increased in the same proportion.

<span class="hr"> </span>

Other salaries have been raised; and there has been a
multiplication of officers not warranted by the financial
ability of the Government.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It is thought that the Government could easily dispense
with the services of the various commissioners, and sub-auditors,
and some others, whose functions could be performed
by other, and more necessary, officers already in existence.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In a government of the proportions and circumstances of
our own, there is no need of so great a division and sub-division
of officers. This multiplication of officers produces
another serious evil, aside from the unwarrantable expenses
necessary to support them. There are frequent conflicts
or confusions of interests and jurisdiction, diverse interpretations
and applications of law,–all tending to obscure the
real object and intention of the Government in creating
these officers.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">This condition of things more especially increases care
and trouble for the Chief Executive, who seems to be considered
by all the ultimate power to bring order out of chaos;
to dispel the confusion that has been so unwarrantably
brought about.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Touching the question of the multiplication of officers,
and increasing the expenses of the Government, the honorable
Legislature are aware that two years have elapsed since
the passage of the bill organizing the County government
of Montserrado.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">My objections on returning the bill were clearly stated at
the time. But the Legislature did not harmonize with the
views of the Executive on this subject; and the law was
passed and put in force. I believe I state a fact, when I
announce, that the County organization has not worked as
smoothly or as advantageously as was hoped. It remains
with the honorable Legislature to examine whether it is
expedient to repeal the organization, or to rectify by amendatory
act any defect in its working.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In connection with the subject of retrenchment, I would
call your attention to the "Act to alter and amend the several
Acts establishing the Judiciary and regulating the powers
common to the Courts of Quarter Sessions and Common
pleas of the several Counties." That amendatory Act remedies
one of the evils complained of–insufficiency of time for
the trial of important cases. But the Act by no means
removes the evil of the enormous expenses paid to reporting
officers. The sum expended for this purpose is out of all
proportion to the good accomplished, and it is, in the
aggregate, much greater than appears at first sight.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">During the year, the Executive has been asked for a

<span class="hr"> </span>

concession for a line of steamers to call at the ports of the
Republic, on the same conditions as two other lines. As
the concession would necessitate the abrogation of the tonnage
dues, the Executive was of opinion that this could be
done only by the power that imposed those dues. The proposal
will therefore be referred to your honorable body.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It is anticipated that a fourth line of steamers, intended
to start in January for the west coast, will call at some of
the ports of the Republic; but as yet no concession has
been asked for.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It is to be regretted that the Legislature, at its last session,
did not consider it expedient to accept the proposal for placing
on the Liberian Coast a steamer for the conveyance of
freight, passengers and the mails, and for the transport of
troops. The reasons given are still as weighty as, if not
more so than, they were a year ago.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The mails sometime lie in adjoining counties a long time,
and are occasionally conveyed by a circuitous, or out of the
way method. Provided it were proposed to move a body of
troops from one section of the Republic into another, there
being no railroads, the sea transit would have to be rapid,
to effect any good.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Not among the least of the benefits to be derived from
such a concession, would be the increased intercourse among
the counties.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I would call your attention to the "Act entitling importers
to a drawback on goods or merchandise that may have been
landed duty-paid in one country, and afterwards transhipped
to another. Whatever may have been the reasons in
past time for the enactment of the law, all of the reasons do
not seem to exist at present. The steamship lines afford
facilities for a pretty equable distribution of goods among the
ports of the Republic. There will, however, occur
occasions when goods on which the duties have
been paid in one county are transhipped to another
county. Since the shipment and reshipment would go
on reciprocally among the counties, there would be no
material loss to any county organization. The drawback
system assists in complicating the financial operations of the
Government, and increases the number of government
demand notes.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In my last message, I called your attention to the loss that
would readily accrue to government by undervaluation of
invoices. I observed, that the "Act to repeal certain proportions
of the Act authorizing specific duties on certain articles
imported into the Republic, and the collection of the same, and
regulating the payment of duties on imports, approved
February 8, 1878," requires that all original invoices shall be verified

<span class="hr"> </span>

by the Liberian Consul of the port, and signed by him;
and that it shall be the imperative duty of all importers to
make oath that the invoice presented is the only one had by
the importer; and that if at any time another should come to
hand, the same will be presented to the Collector. I observed,
further, that the aforesaid provision of the law, having
no penalty attached to its violation, is inoperative.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It is to be regretted that the attempt to amend the law at
the last session did not succeed. The Republic having consuls
in all foreign ports that trade with the country, I see no
difficulty in enforcing the law, if properly amended.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In conformity with the Act of your last session, approved
January 17th, in the month of May, I proclaimed the interdict
of Timbo and its vicinity. Since that time, the Executive
has received a petition from the chiefs of that district,
praying to have the interdict revoked. The petition appeared
to express penitence, but made acknowledgment of only
a single act of aggression recently committed. Considering,
however, that the Act charged them wiih frequently committing
acts of aggression and wrong upon Liberian factors
residing there for the peaceful purposes of trade, and that this
charge appeared to be based upon facts, the Executive did
not judge it expedient to revoke the interdict at that time,
unless, as a penalty, the chiefs would pay a fine for their past
conduct. The interdict, therefore, continues.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There is another important subject which demands our
consideration. I allude to the various missionary establishments
in the country and their importations. From the earliest days
of the colony, down to the present, the government has always
recognized the advisability of encouraging these
establishments. If conducted on legitimate principles, they
assist in promoting the growth of the State and strengthening it
by the implanting of sound principles.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It is true, trouble has sometimes grown out of the
commendable intentions of the government. In the days of the
colony (I quote an observation made by myself on another
occasion) a contest between a foreign church and the government
shook the latter to its foundation. The agent of the
church wielded a money patronage five times as great as
that of the colonial government. Under the law allowing
strictly missionary goods to be imported free of duty, the
agent, it is said, imported large quantities of merchandise for
speculation, and refused to pay duties. The trial of strength
and authority between the foreign church and the colonial
government, although for a long time the battle hung in
even scale, resulted in favor of the latter.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Legislature of the Republic, in subsequent years,
endeavored to preclude the repetition of this abuse by an amendatory
or explanatory Act, more fully defining and, probably

<span class="hr"> </span>

a slight degree, restricting the privileges formerly accorded.
There are missionary institutions that are purely ecclesiastical
or spiritual; and there are those which partake, as well, of
legitimately secular character. These assist in developing
a manual industry and physical capabilities of the people.
Then conducted on a sufficiently large scale, they work in
an interest of the State in another direction. They assist
confirming the right of the State to its outlying territory. 
While encouragement should be given to the former class of
establishments, these latter deserve especially the fostering
of government.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I beg leave to call your attention to our present school system.
The system appears to have failed in accomplishing its
ultimate object. So vital an interest as the education of
the people, upon which so largely depend the prosperity and
perpetuity of the state, should have immediate and careful
consideration.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I am decidedly of opinion, that some change in the conduct
of the schools is necessary. And should the various commissioners
be abolished, further change will be necessary. In
improvement attempted, one of the first and most important
steps will be, to place the schools, as much as practicable
beyond the sphere of the polities of the country.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The bill to improve the school system, that originated in the
Legislature during the last session, had some good features. But
the bill did not pass through. It proposed to place the conduct
of the schools more in the hands of those who should be
invested in them. The teachers, after examination by a
committee or board of each district, would be selected by
those whose interest would prompt them to exact a reasonable
qualification, and a reasonable amount of work; and who
have the privilege of recommending the removal of
incoming teachers.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have frequently remarked, that with our scattered populations
it is impossible to give each town, large or small, a government
school with a competent teacher. If each town or
village must have a school, salaries will necessarily be
small; and very small salaries, as a rule, procure incompetent
teachers. If each township must have a school, it must
augment the government salary. This would procure an
advantage,–it would increase the interest of the people
in their public schools.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The difficulties growing out of the Golah and Boatswain war

<span class="hr"> </span>

have been partially adjusted. The native tribes and clans
are so numerous, their interests often so conflicting, the 
<em class="hi">casus belli</em> so many, the main hope of a permanent settlement
of their difficulties would arise from the founding of
permanent industrial and civilized settlements among them.
Nor will this altogether remedy the evil, unless the civilized
and christian population of the country, as a whole, will
with a commendable patriotism, and a spirit of justice and
equity, work in the direction of their legitimate interests and
the interest of the State.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The experience of the last four years has taught me that
the tribal differences are often increased by the unreasonable
interference of conflicting trade interests. The natives of
the country are, to a great extent, heathen; yet they have 
tolerably clear sense of justice and truth. They have shown
in a number of instances, and sometimes, too, by terrible examples,
that they are able to distinguish between the law 
and just measures and decrees of the Government, and a
capriciousness or selfishness that may lurk behind any true
interest.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">What is the Government but the whole body of the people?
What interests can the Government have not identical
with the interests of the whole people? If the people,
or any class or section of the people, through trade jealousies
and selfishness, endeavor to thwart or hamper the legitimate
operations of the Government, they but hasten their
own eventual ruin.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have again to call your attention to the difficulties of
Half Cavalla.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">After a careful study of this question, I am decidedly of the
opinion that the people of Half Cavalla have no real grievances
of which to complain; nor have they experienced 
unjust treatment from the Government, or any body of
people. Their imaginary grievances have been fermenting
a spirit of rebellion, which has been encouraged by the 
forbearance of the Government. Amicable and peaceful
measures have proved of no avail. The rebellious natives
being encouraged as well by some unprincipled foreigners.
I am of opinion that matters will become more complicated
and serious, unless decisive measures are at once adopted.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have therefore to request your co-operation to adopt
means to settle the difficulties at present existing in the
south-easternmost county of the Republic.</p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Matters not discussed in the present communication will be
laid before you separately.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives,–
I consider this, the beginning of a new legislature,
a most suitable occasion to correct what errors we may
have committed in the past.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There are evils that may be remedied by the ordinary
enactment of law. But there are others that cannot be so reached.
These can be corrected only by an alteration in the fundamental
compact. In the establishment and progress of nations, 
there are principles that may remain unaltered for all
time, because they are fundamental. There are others that
must change with the progress of the age and the growth of
the nation.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">When a nation has proceeded on certain lines of development
and has arrived at a place whence these lines can carry
it no further in its progress, it is evident that a change of direction
must be adopted.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Again, it must be admitted, that in this, as in all other,
governments, some measures are tentative. Should sufficient
trial prove their unsuitableness, they should be replaced by
others better adapted to the condition of things.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">There is a growing sentiment in the country, that the
Executive and Legislative terms of office are too short to secure
efficiency in the measures and policy of Government. I have
on other occasions pointed out some of the evils that grow out
of the frequent elections of the country.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">With regard to the Legislature, a longer term of office, with
biennial, instead of annual, sessions, is considered by some
preferable to the present short term with annual sessions,–
the Constitutional provision for the calling of extra sessions
remaining the same.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In avoiding one extreme, men frequently rush to another.
In shunning the evils of monarchism, republicans have sometimes
disregarded some of its good qualities. I am strictly a
republican; but I am far from asserting that any one form of
government contains in itself all the elements of perfection.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The principles best suited for growth, for the perfection of
manhood, and the well-being of the nation, and those that
should be adopted in any form of government.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I shall allude to one more principle, and I shall have done,–
leaving to your own wisdom the suggestion of others that
may be considered important.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In some governments, the Executive branch is represented

<span class="hr"> </span>

in the Legislature. It is said this facilitates measures, and
explains, more satisfactorily than can be done by any other
method, the measures and policies of the Executive. But I
do not go so far. I would recommend only a limited representation,
by which the delegate of the Executive would have
only a consultative voice, and no vote.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In the growth of nations, the practice often precedes the
development of the theory. I have on another occasion alluded
to some laws of the country that were induced or recommended
by the practice of measures which these laws were
afterwards enacted to perpetuate. With regard to the principle
of a limited or partial representation, or a delegation with
only a consultative voice, the Legislature has already recognized
its importance by the provision made for delegates or
referees from the native chiefs. I am of opinion, however,
that the application of this principle to an executive delegate
or referee would necessitate an amendment of the Constitution.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives,–
I should not feel confident of our final success in
solving the difficult problems before us, but for the assurance
I feel of your patriotic support; and with this assurance, I
promise you my hearty co-operation.</p>
