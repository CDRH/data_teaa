at Gaboon Sept 3d 1863</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon William H. Seward<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would acknowledge 
the receipt of a package containing a Consular Manual
and a Volume of Comml. relations for 1861.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would 
beg leave to state that the authorities of this place refuse 
to receive me in my official capacity that my predecessors 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Dr.[?]</span> Henry Ford and Rev Wm Walker 
were not recognized by the French government and 
that I do consider it to be for the best interest of the 
U.S. and the citizens thereof upon this part of the coast 
that the Comml. Agt. of the United States government 
should be officially recognized. I would call 
your attention to this subject and most respectfully 
request should you deem it proper and expedient
to be furnished at exequatur</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">I am with the highest consideration<br/> 
your most obedient servant<br/> 
Henry May<br/> 
United State Comml. Agt.</p>
