      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St Paul de Loanda<br/>
Oct 15th 1882.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon J.C. Bancroft Davis<br/>
Asst Sectry of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In consideration of the unhealthy state of
this locality at times, I would most respectfully 
solicit the Depart. of State, for a standing
permissions to leave this consulate in charge
of the Vice, or actg. vice consul, whenever
circumstances and urgency in case of 
sickness may compel me to leave Loanda
for a few weeks further North or South as 
may be directed by the Doctors</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This request may appear to you, from
one who has but just joined his post,
of duty, to be a departure from the general
principles of the Depart. but I trust 
that the special nature of my humble 
request may induce you and the Hon:
Secty of State to take the matter with
favorable consideration.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Having consular agencies further North
and South I may be able if such 
is granted to me, to see personally 



how the agencies are, and instruct them
in their duties toward the U.S. govt,
commerce, shipping &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

      <p class="tei_p"> I have been sick for over a month with 
Bilious or green fever and have tried to 
perform the duties I have been intrusted 
with the best of my ability</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
L de R du Verge<br/>
US Consul.</p>
