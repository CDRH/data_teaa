      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have had the honor to receive the Department's despatch No. 11. transmitting the certificate of the appointment of Rudolph Hirsch, Esqr to be Vice Consul General of the United States of this place. For sometime Mr. Hirsch's health has been in so precarious a state that
his

         <span class="hr"> </span>

his phisysician regards it necessary for him to leave the climate of Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am of the opinion that under the circumstances, it is advisable to retain the certificate of his appointment until the result of his illness shall be known. Then, I shall be able to decide, whether or not to submit the name of another person for appointment.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I regret that these untoward circumstances cause the Department so much trouble through my selection of a person to be the incumbent of the position mentioned above. I have the honor

<span class="hr"> </span>

to express the hope, that the Department will approve of my withholding the presentation of the certificate referred to.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
J Milton Turner</p>
