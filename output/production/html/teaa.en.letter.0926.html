      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit herewith my report for the quarter ending this day. In inclosure No. 1. will be found my rent and miscellaneous expense account, in which I have charged and credited the Government as follows: Out of my draft for $100.00/100, dated October 11th and drawn in favor of Jasper Smith United States Consul at Funchal Maderia, I have charged and credited the Government with $50.60/100 the cost, as shown by accompanying vouchers, of sending to the Department a telegram relating to the war at Cape Palmas. Balance of said draft as shown by the inclosure alluded to above was applied as follows: To payment of account of postage for the quarter $21.22/100

To payment of person necessarily employed to procure from the books of the Government of Liberia the figures necessary to the statement of the commerce of this port as required by paragraphs 280.-81. of the Consular Regulations $19.50/100. After having sold my drafts I have discovered a mistaken credit of thirty two cents in my salary account which I have allowed the stand because my drafts are sold. With reference to the exchange vouchers composing a part of this report I desire to remark that it is my constant endeavor to avoid loss by exchange of my drafts; in this I usually succeed, but owing to the peculiar money system employed here I am sometimes compelled to lose something in the sale of my drafts. I avail myself of this occasion to request the Department to grant this Legation a supply of ruled despatch paper.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>

With high consideration<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
