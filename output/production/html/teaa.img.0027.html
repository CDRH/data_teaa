<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>With her husband Menelik, Empress Taitou (or Taitu) ruled Ethiopia from 1889 to 1913 and became a significant international symbol of African sovereignty. As the illustration's caption states, her stepdaughter Zeoditu (usually spelled Zauditu or Zewditu) held the throne by 1916. But Lij Iyasu&#x2014;a controversial figure&#x2014;reigned briefly from 1913 to 1916, until Taitu and others schemed to remove him from power and replace him with her stepdaughter. Empress Zauditu's reign was followed by that of Emperor Haile Selassie.</p>
