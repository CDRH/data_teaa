      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor respectfully to acknowledge
the receipt of your despatch, No. 11. of January
8th 1890, replying to my No. 40. of November 5th
in relation to the Agencies at Cape Palmas and
Grand Bassa.</p>

with the instructions therein contained.
The steamers call here once in two weeks.
Occasionally one calls during this interval;
but those which call here rarely stop
at Grand Bassa; and, only occasionally,
at Cape Palmas.</p>

your obedient servant,<br/>
Ezekiel E Smith,<br/>
