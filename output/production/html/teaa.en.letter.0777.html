      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States, Goree-Dakar Senegambia Africa<br/>
1893.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable Josiah Quincy<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D. C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir: Sometime since I received a Circular
from the Department requesting that Consuls
who had failed to make reports on the
Cotton grown in their Districts should not fail to do so before September next.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When the Department receives my
Accts for the June Quarter of the
Current year, according to which
the Government is indebted to me
for $5.74, possibly in Silver, and
reflects that I am in the midst 
of a cholera epidemic which must
claim some share of my attention,
and that I have a family to
support in Boston which claims
more, it will doubtless be lenient
with me if I cannot answer
all the questions of the Gentlemen
who are interested in Cotton



this way, although I would gladly
do so if I could. I will give what 
I have in my head on the subject.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Cotton plant is indigenous
to this country, and for native manufacture
is gathered in considerable quantities,
but none I think is at present
exported, although at the close of the
Secession War it was exported in small
quantities, even to the United States.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Cotton now gathered is
manufactured by hand-looms in the
most primitive way but the fabrics
are strong and handsome, and are
worn more or less by nearly all the
natives, although the cheaper goods
of Manchester constitute the larger
part of their every-day wear.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have little doubt but that
Senegambia alone is capable of 
producing at least half as much
cotton as is now produced in the
United States and there are indications
that Capital may in the not distant
future be devoted to its production. I



have seen it growing wild in
several places and doubt if much
pains has yet been taken anywhere
to cultivate it. When this is
done besides vastly increasing
the quantity, the staple will
doubtless be improved.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Beginning at about 40 miles 
to the southward of Goree and
from thence southward the Coast
of Senegambia is in general low
and much penetrated by bayous
which allow the tide-water to
penetrate far from the coast. Rice 
is easily cultivated in these very
extensive districts, and I should
think "Sea Island Cotton" might also
do well. Carolina Rice as been
tried in one locality with good results,
the wild rice produced before having
been much smaller, although sweet.
The same change would most 
likely be effected by importing cotton
<del>plants</del> seed from some country where
a superior article has been produced



by long and careful cultivation.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Agriculture until within a recent
period has not received the attention
of Europeans in this country, and
the main crop for exportation, which
is Ground-nuts or peanuts, is still
produced in the old manner without
any ploughing, the ground being prepared
by scratching it over with a rude
implement of native manufacture not half
so good as a spade. But with only
such rude means to produce them there
have been exported from the Bay
of Goree within the past six or seven
months nearly seventy-thousand
tons of nuts, worth at $45 per ton
more than three millions of dollars.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">But a large company has recently
been formed which is using Capital
in Cultivation as well as in trade
and as it is located in a good
cotton district I expect cotton
will come in for a share of
its attention as well as nuts,
indigo, coffee, and other staples.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Enclosed will be found a chance
specimen of the Cotton grown in the
Country, and several peices of native
cloth, which as can be seen, are
very strong and durable.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am sorry that I have not
been able to do better in the way
of making reports, etc. but as it
appears from the papers that
the Chinese cannot be deported
without an appropriation, it is
quite a relief for me to find
that there are precedents for
not having a mill-wheel go
briskly round when there is a
lack of water in the channel.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am esteemed Sir<br/>
Very truly &amp; respectfully yours<br/>
P. Strickland<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Inclosure<br/>
Sample of Cotton &amp; samples of cotton cloth
made by the natives of Senegambia.</p>
