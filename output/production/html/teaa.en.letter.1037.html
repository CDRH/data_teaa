refer you to my despatch
No. 48 of which I sometime
wrote in regard to the 
trouble at Cavalla. Since

christian native and
many of the Americo-Liberian
have been
forced

forced from their homes
to subject on the kindness
of their friends or starve.
His excellency President
H. R. W. Johnson of this
Republic has not as yet
taken any steps to arest
the spirit of rebellion.
Further information
will be given to the
Department of State

taken to arest the

         <h3>To the Monrovia Public:</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">There is trouble at Cavalla; spirit of disloyalty and
rebellion is at work. Because the civilized and christian
natives did not sympathize, with this feeling, they were
forced to leave their homes and relations to save their
lives, and flee to Harper, Cape Palmas. Leaving their
farms and employments they are deprived of the means of
support, and are dependent upon christian help until they
can help themselves.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The people at Cape Palmas, have done, and are doing all
in their power for the comfort of the refugees. This appeal
comes to you now. What will <em class="hi">you</em> do? Out of your
abundance will you give much, and out of your poverty give
a little? Every little will be a help. Let not the benevolent
hard working poor fail to give because they have
but a little: but of that little give <em class="hi">something</em>.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Every thing is needed, food, raiment, household articles
&amp;c: the sufferers number between forty and fifty men,
women and children. Show your liberality towards your
brethren and sisters of this native church, the church of
the Epiphany at Cavalla. Right Rev. Bishop Ferguson
will gladly bear to them your christian gifts.</p>

Mayor.</p>
