      <p class="tei_p">United States Consulate<br/>
St Paul de Laonda<br/>
Jany 9th 1883</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To Hon: John Davis<br/>
Asst. Secty. of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the regret to state that the named
"Augustus Jason" as sworn by him in his
affidavit 19 years of age born in New Bedford
Mass. died on board the Portuguese Brig
"Rovador" on the 2d January of Pernicious
or pestilant fever after an illness of 14
hours.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Jason was decently buried by this consulate
in the English or Protestant Cemetery; not
having been able to know that he was
a Catholic, which is my firm believe he was
being of Portuguese origin; the remainder
of his clothing not interred with him
consisted of one woolen Blanket, one
pumper and one overhaul was burned 
according to the customs of this locality
for such contagious diseases.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The other two seamen David Miller and
Charles Sims, would have certainly died
here if I had not had the opportunity
to send them by said vessel. As to



Henry Williams, he is still in the Hospital, but
will try very hard to have him accepted on
board the Portuguese Mail steamer to Santiago
where he has more chances to be such home
than from here.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The small pox epidemic has almost disappeared 
here this locality, from here this epidemic
seem to have followed a southerly direction 
passing at Benguela, Mossamedes and 
now is, as I am told at the Cape of good
Hope.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We have now in port only one Portuguese
merchant brig, and two Portuguese man
of War.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
L. De R. du Verge<br/>
US Consul</p>
