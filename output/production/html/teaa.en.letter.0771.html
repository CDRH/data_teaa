      <p class="tei_p">U.S. Consulate Gorée Dakar<br/>
May 29th 1889</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Honorable<br/>
William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to bring to your notice
that circumstances forbid my acting longer
as Vice Consul at Gorée Dakar and I herewith
tender my resignation</p>

      <p class="tei_p">While at Bissau in April last engaged in
liquidating the affairs of Mr F. C. Butman
at that place I received a letter from Mr
P. Strickland the Consul asking me to reply
by telegraph if I could be depended on to 
care for the Consulate in his absence; not
knowing at that time of any objection I signified
my assent and it was not until I arrived here
that I learned that my employers were firmly
opposed to my further continuance in the
Consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I deeply regret the disappointment to Capt
Strickland who may in the case of his



absence have to close the Consulate, but am
glad that this will happen in the unhealthy
season when there is not generally much
business done.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir<br/>
Very respectfully Yours<br/>
René D. Potin<br/>
U.S. Vice Consul.</p>
