      <p class="tei_p">Subject:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Official relations between this Consulate
and the Province of S. Thomé</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Abstract of Contents.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(1) Though comprised within this Consular
district, the Province of S. Thomé has never
had any official relation with this Consulate.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(2) It seems desirable that, when appointed
the U.S. Consul at Loanda be also introduced, 
by the Portuguese Government to the
Governor of S. Thomé.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(3) For complete statistics and better 
reports, the Consulate ought to receive
the Official Bulleting of S. Thomé, as
it already receives that of Angola.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States,<br/>
at Loanda, March 25, 1892.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Islands of S. Thomé (St. Thomas)
and Principe (Prince's Isld.), comprised
within my consular district, form a separate
Province, with a Governor of its own, and with
an Official Bulletin, in which all official
communications and statistics of S. Thomé
are published.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As far as I know, the U.S. Consul at
Loanda, when appointed and approved, is
introduced by the Portuguese Government
to the Governor of Angola alone, and not to
that of S. Thomé, nor has the Official 
Bulletin of S. Thome ever been sent to
this Consulate.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As the Islands of S. Thomé and Principe
are by their large plantations of coffee,
cocoa and other tropical produce constantly

<span class="hr"> </span>

growing in commercial importance and promise
to have considerable trade relations with the
United States as soon as the means of
communications improve and the production
of either country be made known, it seems
desirable that the incumbent of this Consular
post be officially introduced, by the Portuguese
Government, to the Governor of S. Thomé, and
that the Official Bulletin of S. Thomé be
sent to this Consulate as that of Angola already 
is.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I therefore suggest to the Department
the advisability of requesting those two
favors of the Portuguese Government.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Heli Chatelain<br/>
U.S. Coml Agent</p>
