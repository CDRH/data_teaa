      <p class="tei_p">I have received the Governor's 
Commands to inform you that a man by 
the name of William Taylor declaring 
himself to be a subject of the United

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am directed to acknowledge the 
receipt of your letter of September 12th 1854, 
addressed to the Commander in Chief of the 
African Squadron.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Western Coast of Africa is of 
great extent and there are at present, in this 
Squadron but three vessels of War, it is therefore 
impossible to comply with your request 
that one of them should visit Sierra Leone 
"at least once or twice in every two months"</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Commodore has written to the 
Government renewing his statement of the 
necessity for an American Consulate at 
Sierra Leone, and has recalled the attention 
of

      <p class="tei_p">West Coast of Africa, Sierra Leone<br/>
September 1854</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Humble Memorial of the undersigned 
the commander of vessels belonging to citizens 
of the United States of America; Merchants; 
super cargoes traders and others citizens of 
America trading or residing on the West 
Coast of Africa.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Humbly Sheweth,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">1 That we your memorialists 
have after much consideration on the 
subject matter of this petition come to the unanimous 
conclusion that it is our duty to the 
Government of which we are citizens to report 
the very unsatisfactory position in which the 
representation of the American Government 
stands in the Colony of Sierra Leone.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">2 That notwithstanding the 
very important and extensive commerce between 
the United States and West Coast 
of Africa, and particularly with this 
Colony it is a singular fact that there 
has never been a Consul nor event Consular 
Agent appointed by the United States Government 
as its representative here.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That

<span class="hr"> </span>

3 That on the 11th of August 
1853 Commander I Mayo of the United 
States Flag Ship "Constitution" having due 
regard to the interests of his Government 
was pleased to appoint Captain John Etting 
Taylor an American citizen and Merchant 
residing in this Colony as Acting Consul 
on the West Coast of Africa.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">4 That such acting appointment 
has never been confirmed by the 
Government of the United States nor 
legally recognized by the English Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">5 That although the American 
Government has at all times sanctioned 
those acts pertaining to the consulship, 
which have been performed by the acting 
Consul and bearing in mind the fact 
that the local authorities in Sierra Leone 
have hitherto recognized Captain Taylor 
as acting Consul, yet we regard it as 
unsafe to permit matters to remain as 
they now are, inasmuch as it is in the 
power of the English Government whenever 
it may think proper to decline any further 
recognition of the authority of the preset 
acting Consul.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">6 That your memorialists 
desire to bear testimony to the strict attention 
which the acting Consul has at 
all times paid to the requirements of the 
commanders of American vessels and 
American citizens generally on this

<span class="hr"> </span>

part of the Coast and to his sensitive regard 
for the dignity and honor of the Union.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your memorialists 
therefore pray that the United 
States Government will be pleased 
to confer this appointment of 
Consul of the United States 
Government on this Coast 
on the present acting Consul. 
And your memorialists will 
ever pray &amp;c. </p>
