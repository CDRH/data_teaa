      <p class="tei_p">To the Hon.<br/>
The Secretary of State<br/>
U.S. America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have honor to 
inform you that I have the keeping of 
some U. States property connected with 
the Commercial Agency of this place. 
It was left in my care by the late Henry 
A Ford M.D. and has been in the Mission 
Store till the present time. About one 
month since I opened two of the boxes 
to see whether the climate may have injured
the contents, I only inspected them
enough to know that neither climate or 
insects had touched them, &amp; closed them 
as before. One box seemed to contain 
books &amp;c. the other copying press.
There is a third box (small) &amp; a package 
or book in a brown paper envelope.
This property is as safe as the property 
of the Missions of the Am. Board of Commissioner 
for Foreign Missions.</p>
      <span class="hr">Â </span>
      <p class="tei_p">I write this simply to inform the 
Department of the condition of the
property and its location.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As our latest dates from the United
States are only to Feb. 6th, &amp; not being 
entirely certain that your locum
tenens is the City of Washington.
I enclose this to a friend A. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_name tei_unclear">[unclear, one name]</span>
Esqr. Bible House, Astor Place N. York</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Very Respectfully Yours<br/>
W. Walker.<br/>
Missionary of A.B.C.F.M.</p>
