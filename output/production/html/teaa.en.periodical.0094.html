      <p class="tei_p">Bishop Taylor's advance party has reached the goal in the depths of Africa toward which he has so long been struggling. Before his pioneer band of missionaries started, the Bishop declared his intention to plant stations among the tribes along the Upper Kassi and its tributaries. Toward this region his chain of stations has been steadily lengthening. Dr. Harrison, one of the party that the Bishop led up the Congo in July last, has reached Luluaburg, the new station of the Congo State. He is one of the four physicians who have followed the Bishop to Africa, and he is now established among the natives. These Balubas are among the most remarkable savages in the world.â€”<em class="hi">Bombay Guardian.</em>
