<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This political cartoon brings attention to the atrocities committed by King Leopold against the Congolese people in the Congo Free State. Leopold is chewing on a bone (possible from a human leg) with one side covered in rubber. Described as a "willful murderer" of "natives" and "babies," and as the "Butcher King" of Belgium and the Congo, Leopold intends to eat all "the leavings." Standing off to the side is a British official frothing at the mouth, begging Leopold for the leavings. The accompanying article entreats the reader to write to Secretary of State Elihu Root demanding that he take action against the Belgian sovereign and not wait for Great Britain to act. The suggestion is that the British government was only interested in taking over the colony to reap the benefits of the rubber trade. The article suggests that the United States should lead the "international indignation" against Leopold&#x2019;s administration of the Congo and call for an international conference to discuss future actions against the sovereign. It also recommends that readers send a ten-cent donation to the Congo Reform Association (based in Boston, Massachusetts) to aid in their efforts to disband the "free state" and bring relief to the suffering Congolese.</p>
