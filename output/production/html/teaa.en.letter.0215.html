      <p class="tei_p">Department of State.<br/>
Monrovia. January 23, 1891.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">His Excellency<br/>
H. R. W. Johnson</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr. President,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When I arrived in the United 
States, on the 14th September 1890 I
found the Country in a great state of 
excitement consequent on the elections, 
which were held on the 4th of November 
last.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I found it would be useless to go 
on to Washington then, as Mr. Secretary
Blaine was away on an election
tour, and he did not return until
after the elections. After the elections
were over which resulted disastrously
for the present Administration in 
nearly all the States. I went to 
Washington, on the 10th of November, and 
the next day, Hon John H. Smyth, with
whom I stopped while in the City, 
accompanied me to the State Department, 
when we found twenty or more
persons, all waiting to get an interview

<span class="hr"> </span>

interview with the Secretary. We waited 
about half a day, and were then informed 
that the Secretary would not be 
at his office that day. Mr. Smyth and I 
called the next day, but after waiting some 
hours he had to leave, but I remained, and 
about 1 o'clock the Secretary came, and
I was admitted to an interview for 
about ten minutes. Mr. Blaine then 
excused himself, as the new Spanish 
Minister was then waiting by appointment
to be taken to the White House
to be presented to the President. Mr
Secretary asked me to call on him the
next day, and instructed the usher to
bring me "right in", as soon as he got 
to the office. I called the next Saturday
but after waiting until after 12 m, we
were told, to the great disappointment 
of all of us then waiting, that the 
Secretary would not be at his office 
that day.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I called at the Department the next 
Monday and Tuesday; but with the same
result. One of the gentlemen that I 
met, waiting to see the Secretary, told 
me

<span class="hr"> </span>

me that he had called daily for fourteen 
days, and when I left, he had not
yet been favored with an interview.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I then left Washington, and from 
Philadelphia I wrote a letter to 
Secretary Blaine, copy of which I 
now present. After waiting several 
days without an answer, I wrote 
Mr Coppinger and requested him to
call upon the Secretary and inquire
whether my letter had been shown 
to him, and feared that it might 
be laid down somewhere, and not 
come under his notice. Mr. Coppinger 
wrote me that he had called several 
times at the Department, but without 
success, but that he would 
still try to carry out my wishes.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Blaine received me very 
courteously, and but for the fact that 
the Spanish Minister was then
waiting by his appointment, I
think he would have given me a 
much longer and favorable interview. 
I requested the Secretary 
to send me an answer to New 
York

<span class="hr"> </span>

New York, and perhaps I may get it by 
next mail.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This matter having been initiated 
allow me to suggest, Mr. President,
that it be followed up through the 
State Department, as I deem it 
of great importance, at this time, 
that we have a demonstration of 
friendship from one of the Great Powers.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be Mr President<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
W. M. Davis<br/> 
Commissioner &amp;c.</p>
