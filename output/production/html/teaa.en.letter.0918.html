      <p class="tei_p">I hasten to apprize you of the inadvertence through which, in my account for salary for the quarter ended June 30th 1875, I omitted to credit the Government for the amount of my draft for one hundred seventy five gold dollars - $125.00/100 - in favor of B. Matthews, and dated May 5th 1875. I will make the proper credit for said draft in my account for the present quarter. In expressing my regret for the above described circumstance, I can only add, that I will, hereafter, endeavor to avoid any similar occurrence.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir/<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
J Milton Turner</p>
