         <p class="tei_p">American Negroes for Africa.—Dr. Blyden, of Monrovia, Liberia,
according to Goldthwaite's Geographical Magazine, believes the problem
of the reclamation of Africa is to be solved through the agency of the civilized 
Negroes of America. In a reception tendered him at Lagos, Africa,
this able and highly-educated member of the Negro race remarked:
"To restore to their homes those who have been transported from the
land of their origin by wickedness and greed of gain should be considered
the highest duty of every Englishman, and I am happy to know that some
decided steps have been taken to bring about this much-desired result."

Dr. Blyden says tropical Africa can not possibly be made the permanent
home of white men. Even if they live there a few years they are ultimately 
compelled to leave the country. Their children born there are
apt to be weak and sickly, and the white race can not maintain its vigor
and activity in those regions. The colored people of the States and of
Brazil, he thinks, would be the only best instruments for civilizing Africa.
For about a year steamers have been plying between Bahia and Lagos,
repatriating many former slaves from Brazil.</p>
