      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to enclose 
herewith a letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the
Department of State, a copy of
which he has sent to the Consulate
and which I have translated
and also enclose herewith.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The sum and substance of
the communication is, a request 
of our Government to sanction
a tax on his own subjects, which
I have assured His Highness will
be undoubtedly granted him.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Germans &amp; English as
a pretense for making trouble with
the Sultan, claim that he has no
right to levy any taxes or duties
on any produce raised in the 
Sultanate

<span class="hr"> </span>

Sultanate of Zanzibar other
than is specified in new
treaties, even on his own subjects.
The Sultan claims that he has 
a right to tax his own subjects
as he pleases and produce belonging
to them.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">This is a matter which 
does not in the least concern
Americans or American interests 
in any way and which I
assume that our Government
will not care for me to take any
part in the troubles likely to arrive
from this dispute.</p>
