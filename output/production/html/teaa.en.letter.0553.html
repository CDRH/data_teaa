      <p class="tei_p">Report
on the need of direct steam communication 
between the United States
and Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I</p>
      <p class="tei_p">General Facts and Conclusions</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(1) The industry and commerce of the U.S. 
need: (a) raw material for the factories 
(b) a market for the overproduction 
of manufactures.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(2) A look at Africa's extent and untapped 
resources prove that it will be,
in the near future, the greatest producer
of raw material, the greatest consumer
of foreign manufacturers, and the best field
for skilled labor.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(3) The U.S. has the advantage over
any other nation in its possibilities as
a consumer of African produce and a producer 
of material needed for the upbuilding
of Africa's civilization.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(4) Geographically, the distance between
the U.S. and W. Africa (south of the
Sahara) is not greater then that between

<span class="hr"> </span>

England or Germany and West Africa.
Nor are the Cape Verde Islands any
farther removed from the U.S. than
are England and Germany.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(5) Within five or six years the tonnage
between England, Germany, Portugal,
and W. Africa has more than doubled,
while France and Belgium, and also
private firms, leave added new lines
to said coast.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(6) The U.S. shipping to Africa, which
was considerable previous to the river, has
steadily decreased, solely because steam
has not been added to sail, and
because other lines from Europe have 
been allowed to draw the trade
over the doubly long route of England
and Germany.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(7) The present exchange of productions
and movement of passengers between
American and Africa, including what
goes via England, Portugal and Germany 
would suffice to warrant the
establishment of a modern line of steamers, 
but the best would follow its <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>
      </p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">(8) At present it takes letters from
Angola and Congo from six to eight
weeks to reach New York. A line
of steamers going direct to Cape Verde
Islands, and thence down the Coast
at the average rate of trading steamers
would reach Liberia in a fortnight
and the Congo and Angola in eight
to twelve days more; that is in
half the time now required.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">II</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Personal observations</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(1) I have sailed, or rather steamed, 
four times along the West Coast of
Africa, seeing all points of any importance 
between <del>the</del> Madeira and
Mossamedes, at the southern extremity 
of Angola. Never had I a chance to
travel on an American trading vessel:
the first outward-bound voyage I made
(in 85) by the British and African S.S.
Line, the second on the U.S.S.
"Pensacola"; the first northward trip
I made on Portuguese man of war
"Africa" and the second on the Portuguese

<span class="hr"> </span>

packet to St. Vincent (Porto Grande)
and thence by tramp-steamer to Philadelphia.
The first voyage from Liverpool to Loanda
took almost eight weeks. The last voyage
from Loanda to Philadelphia took <del>about</del>
twenty one days; exclusive of 5 days stoppage
at S. Thomé and three days at St. Vincent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">My mission being scientific and <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span>
only such commercial facts as forced
themselves on me were noticed and 
can now be collected. A special study
would reveal much more hopeful indications.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(2) The Cape Verde Islands</p>
      <p class="tei_p">At St. Vincent, Mr. Randall, father,
who was a long time U.S. Consular Agt
remembers the time when Port Grande
was a miserable hamlet of fisher-huts.
Now it is a large town and one of the 
guest harbors of the world. Nearly all
the houses are covered in shingles, and
these as well as the timber come from 
America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Here the bark of Mr. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Betman[?]</span> of Boston,

<span class="hr"> </span>

of W. H. Mitchell, N.Y. and probably
that of Yates and Porterfield, touch
at regular intervals on their way to
Dakar, Goree and Sierra Leone.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Cape Verde Islanders, as many 
of them told me, are more American
than Portuguese. Every man, who gets
a chance, wants to see the U.S.A.
great many are U.S. citizens, having 
been nationalized as sailor on American
vessels. I know of a sailing vessel that
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">salled[?]</span> at Brava and got there a
full cargo of passengers at 50 dollars.
A direct line of steamers can reckon
on a regular supply of passengers to 
and from the U.S. and Cape Verde Islands.
As a winter resort some of these Island
will soon vie with Madeira, the Azores
and the Canaries. Americans would no
doubt soon prefer them to Madeira at
the Canaries.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The reports of the U.S. Consul at Santiago 
ought to show that there is now 
some direct and indirect export from
Cape Verde Islands to the U.S.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">(3) Senegambia and Sierra Leone</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The above mentioned American firms
are constantly sending there some bark
and I suppose the Department is better
informed than I on the business they 
do.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(4) Liberia</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The connection of this colony of ours
with the motherland and European
nations is too well known for me
to dwell on it. Liberia alone would 
furnish enough passengers and freight
movement to support a small steamer
and many others to follow, if the 
custom barrier between mother and
daughter were lowered.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(5) Gold Coast, Niger, Cameroons,
Gaboon, S. Thomé, and Congo</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Wherever I have been, at all
points of the Coast and Islands I
have found the same desire of
traders wishing to get goods direct
from America, of shipping produce
in the same way, and of educated
nations wishing to get passage to the

<span class="hr"> </span>

"big country" not to settle there, but
to learn its ways.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There is no conception in America
of the immense resources of all 
kinds stood up in those regions, nor 
of the mysterious, magnet like, power of attraction
this republic exerts on the minds of
Africans the moment they emerge from
tribal isolation. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">(6) Angola</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In this province, which is regularly
visited by the monthly lines of Germany 
and France, the tri-weekly of England,
and the bi-weekly of Portugal, the 
need of direct steam communication
with the U.S. seems to be realized 
with the clearest consciousness, especially
since the recent troubles with England.
One Jewish firm charting every year
a few sailing vessels to bring lumber,
kerosene, flour, furniture etc. from
the States and the profits it realizes 
are larger than it is willing to confess.
The Schooner "Horace Scudder" that 
used to visit all ports of Angola

<span class="hr"> </span>

yearly, will a mixed cargo of American 
goods, has been greatly missed for this
last few years. A whole batch of
traders used planters are already now
writing to me of their intention to visit
the Chicago Fair and to see with
with their own eyes how best to establish
and extend direct commercial relations
with this country.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As soon as I reach my post, I
hope to be able to give exact statistics
of the important agriculture and trade
and of the immense resources of that
large province.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(7) Cape Colony (and South African
Republics</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Considering that the water route
between the U.S. and the Cape and
that between England and the Cape
are practically equal, there is no
reason why this country could not
compete on that promising market
in all those articles in which it
does compete in Europe.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Nor should the deep sympathy

<span class="hr"> </span>

between the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> United States
of South-Africa and their model
on this hemisphere be forgotten.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(8) Summing my observation
on all the West-Coast I may state</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(a) that all this lumber, kerosene,
flour, and canned meats that is used
on the West-Coast comes directly or
indirectly from America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Lately, however, Norwegia is has begun to seriously
compete with America in the lumber
trade.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(b) In cotton-goods (which form the
most important article of importation
in Africa), preserved fruit and meats
(especially corned beef and salt pork)
in machinery for agriculture, tools
and implements of all kinds, rolling
stock for railways, cheap clock and
watches, cheap furniture, notions
and intentions of all kinds, patent
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">mediums[?]</span>, etc. the United States
can compete with other nations as
soon as the goods have not to
travel over England and Germany.</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">(c) The main produce of Africa, as it
is now, india-rubber, ivory, pea-nuts,
skins, wax, dye stuffs, ginger, <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">cainwood[?]</span>, 
coffee, cocoa, kola-nuts &amp; fibres, etc.
are all wanted in the U.S. as much
as in Europe.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Whether palm-oil would find here
as good a market as in Europe I
cannot say but I don't see why it
should not.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(d) As to the quantity its sufficiency is proved by the fact that
steamers have rapidly increased in
size and number so that now there
are ten regular lines of steamers, besides
a number belonging to Coast trading firms
when six or seven years ago there
was only the English line with
the then modest beginnings of the
now powerful German line.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">(9) American missionaries in Africa</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Exclusive of the United Presbyterian
in Egypt, who would never use
the Africa lines, there are now
in Africa American missionaries
representing 18 religious organizations</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">1. The United Brethren, with their prosperous,
Colony-like mission among the Mende
of Sierra Leone.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">2. The Kansas Soudan Mission of the Y.M.C.A.
with coast-station at Sierra Leone</p>
      <p class="tei_p">3. Wesleyan Methodists at Sierra Leone</p>
      <p class="tei_p">4. Free Methodists in Sierra Leone, and
Liberia, and East-Coast and going to extend to Congo
and other parts.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">5. African Methodist Episcopal in 
Liberia</p>
      <p class="tei_p">6. Methodist Episcopal in Liberia, Congo,
Angola.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">7. Protestant Episcopal in Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">8. Lutherans in Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">9. Mormonites in Liberia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">10. Southern Baptists in Yorubaland</p>
      <p class="tei_p">11. Northern Presbyterians in German
Cameroons, and French Gaboon and
Spanish Corisco.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">12. Southern Presbyterian on Congo</p>
      <p class="tei_p">13. Northern Baptists on Congo</p>
      <p class="tei_p">14. Christian Alliance on Congo</p>
      <p class="tei_p">15. American Board in Angola, and
East-Africa, and Zululand</p>
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <p class="tei_p">16. Swedish Lutherans on Congo.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">17. Friends in Madagascar</p>
      <p class="tei_p">18. Roman Catholics, in different fields.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">To these should be added a 
number independent missionaries.
The total number of these missionaries
is set down as 204; but it is really
considerably higher, for the women 
are not included in that enumeration.
These American missionaries are 
assisted in their work by more than
600 native evangelists. The money
expended on these American and native missionaries 
is more than 250,000 <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">1/100[?]</span>
per year.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There are enough indications to make
it almost certain That next year
will see an unprecedented rush of
American missionaries to African so
that the above number will soon
be doubled and trebled.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Now, almost to a man, these missionaries 
with their families travel via
England and bring their outfit and
that of their stations in Europe,
simply because there is no direct
line of steamers</p>
