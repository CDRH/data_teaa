St Paul de Loanda<br/>
16th September 1881.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to 
request the Department to 
grant me leave of absence for
6 months as both the partners
in my Commercial firm having
died in April last, it may be
absolutely necessary that I 
should visit Europe about
February or March. I will
arrange with one of my friends
to take charge of the Consulate
during my absence, whose name
I will advise in good time to the
Department. As I only intend
going to treat of business matters
I do not expect to be away for
a longer period than 3 or 4 months.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most Obedient Servant<br/>
Robt S. Newton<br/>
Vice Consul</p>
      <p class="tei_p">To the <br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
