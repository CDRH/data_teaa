      <p class="tei_p">Agreeably with an instruction imparted through the Department's No. 87, I have the honor to transmit herewith my report for the quarter ended this day. In continuation of the subject of my necessity to remove the Archives of my Legation and Consulate, to a more safe location, as refered to in my No 155 to the Secretary of State,–dated April 14 1875; I now take the liberty to invite your attention to inclosures one and two of this despatch, and to explain as follows. After a diligent, but fruitless inquiry extending throughout the major part of the month of April, I was compelled to conclude that the premises refered to in the above inclosures, were not alone the only place to be obtained for the amount allowed me for rent, but the only place of any description 
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to be rented on any terms whatever, in Monrovia. (It is customary here, for one desiring a house to purchase a lot of ground and build.) The owner of this place would only agree to let me have it on condition that I would advance him a sufficient sum of money to place the premises in tenable repair. This I had no authority to do. But the severe rains of May and June, were at hand, and my condition was then such as to forbid delay in the removal of the Archives to a place where they would be safe from damage and destruction by the rain. It was my strong preference to request instruction from the Department, but the time was too short to allow of my receiving a reply in season to avoid the rain;–I was in a dilema, my necessity was imperative. I have, therefore, made the best agreement possible with Mr Yates, and secured the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the place in Broad Street for five years. I have paid to him from my personal funds, the amount set forth in voucher No. 2, and signed a contract, copy of which is transmitted herewith and marked 2. I would have informed you of this transaction, at an earlier date, but it seemed to belong more appropriately in my quarterly report. I will be perfectly contented with any manner in which the Department may see fit to reimburse me for the amount advanced to Mr Yates. I have felt authorised to draw for $25.00 of that amount to cover the two months which have elapsed since the 1st of May. Voucher No. 1 is intended to cover my draft dated May 5th 1875, for $8.33/100 paid for rent of the old office for the Month of April. I sincerely hope that my action in this transaction, may, in consideration of the emergency

<span class="hr"> </span>

emergency in which I was placed, meet with the sanction of the Department; and, that I have not incured displeasure.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have to report also, that I am without the proper means of keeping my books and official documents in a durable state of file and preservation. I have been confined to an old and rotten, now useless table, instead of a desk instead of a desk. On attempting to move the box in which I have hetofore kept my despatches, and other official documents on file, it dropped in pieces and is no longer of use. The United States Statutes, government reports, and other beautifully bound, valuable works, sent to me by the Department, are fast accumulating into a handsome collection of useful books,–especially useful in this country. I have therefore, to respectfully request that permission be granted to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to me, to order from Maderia, or some other near post,–thus saving time and freight–a cheap writing desk and plain book case with shelves, suitable to file the books and documents refered to above. I would also like one chair.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir/<br/>
