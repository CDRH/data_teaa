      <p class="tei_p">On Saturday the 6th March I was waited 
on by David C. Miller late Master of the 
American barque "Gem" who informed me 
that his vessel had been lost on the reefs on 
the West side of the island of "Orange" on the
morning of the 4th March that he with
3 of his Sailors had arrived at this port 
in a small boat and that he was desirous
of making a declaration before me relative 
to the loss of his vessel. A copy of the declaration
I herewith enclose marked A. Knowing that 
a brig called the "Potomac" belonging to the same
owner as the "Gem" was at Bissão I dispatched 
the 3 Sailors to that place the same evening with 
the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Hon:[?]</span> Colonial Secretary

a letter to the Governor of Bissão requesting that
the 3 men might be allowed to go on board 
the "Potomac" lying in Portuguese Waters. This
request was granted, but on the night of 
the 10th instant the three men were sent 
back to me accompanied with the enclosed 
note marked B from the Master of the "Potomac".</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the 8th instant the other boat and men
mentioned in the declaration reached this port. 
In all the 2 boats contained 10 persons, of 
these 10 individuals I now send on to Freetown

      <p class="tei_p">David C. Miller, late master of the 
American Barque "Gem" states -</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the morning of the 4th March I made the 
land coming from the Isles-de-Loss, which I afterwards 
found out to be that of the Island of "Orange"
bearing E. N. E. I saw a line of breakers and then
altered my course and stood to the southward and
Eastward, at this time I was in to fathoms water,
after altering and standing to the S. and E. I still
found shoal Water until the Vessel struck in 3 fathoms,
after she had struck I saw it was hopeless to think of 
getting her off as she continued to beat into one fathom.
I then (ordered) had the 2 Boats ordered out, into which I
put provisions and Water, the boat into which I got I
had 3 men, the other boat under the Chief Officer had 5 
men. The vessel struck about 9.30. a.m. and the weather 
was 

<span class="hr"> </span>

was very thick - after we left the vessel we all saw that 
she was on fire. smoke coming out from about 
the Foremast and Kitchen - after we had placed 
about a 1/4 of a mile between the boats and the
vessel, an explosion took place on board occasioned
by the fire reaching the powder which was on board. I
had I think about 3 Tons of Powder on board at the time 
of the fire, several explosions took place blowing the whole of 
the after part away, The main and mizen masts going at 
the came time. As it was out of all human power to do
any good in staying, I gave the boats a course to
steer by so that we could make the Island of Bulama,
which I made about 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 
the 6th March 1869. The boat under charge of the Chief Officer 
has not yet come in, The last I saw of the Chief Officer's 
boat was about 6 P.M. on the 4th March 1869</p>
