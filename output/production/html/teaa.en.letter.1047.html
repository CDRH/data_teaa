of the United States to retain of
S. S. Seviers salary, at least $200.00
to make up for the "deficit" in his
contingent and fee account, as
consular officer for the first two months
of this the second quarter. I have
no hesitancy in informing you that
he did a great many unauthorized
and unwarranted "things" which
will be reported at the end of this

quarter. Such as paying $20.00 for
wine on acc't of some parade on the
part of urchins in the Republic

no voucher present etc.</p>
