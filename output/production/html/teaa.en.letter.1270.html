      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to say,
that having experienced the difficulties,
struggles and hardships
of the last dry season here, without
having a well, on the Legation,
premises; in trying to obtain
water from private wells, on
other lots; and having some
knowledge of the bad effects and
dangers, in the use of impure
and muddy water, I have
requested of the Hon. R. H. Jackson
the administrator of the
estate of which the Legation
premises, forms a part, to sink
a well on the premises between
this

<span class="hr"> </span>

this and the next dry season.
He informs me, through his
agent, Judge H. W. Travis, that
if he sinks a well on the premises
he will charge $350.00 per
annum for rent, instead of
$300.00 as now paid. The
first years' rent contract
will expire September 30,
1899. I would like to be
advised before renewing.
I will add, however, that
as the location of the Legation
is some what rocky, it is not
certain that we can succeed
in sinking a well, short of
much blasting. In case
we can it will hardly
cost over fifty dollars; I
would therefore, suggest the
propriety of the Government
authorizing me to have the
well sunk, at a cost, not
exceeding fifty dollars; as
being much cheaper than
having

<span class="hr"> </span>

having the administrator to
have it done at an annual
cost of fifty dollars, in additional
rent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Awaiting your
advice and reply. I have
the honor to be your obedient servant;<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
M. R. and C. General.</p>
