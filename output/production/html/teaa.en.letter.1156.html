Streets and roadways <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">&amp;c;[?]</span>

      <p class="tei_p">Monrovia Liberia though the Capital
of the Republic with a population
variously estimated from 3000 to
5000 have not a Street or alley
paved; The Streets and alleys are
nicly covered with grass and weeds
intermingle with beautiful wild
flowers. the side walks are in
places cleared by cutting out the grass
The city of Monrovia is situated at an 
altitude of 300 to 400 feet above the
level of the sea. on a rock covering
the intire sight on which the city <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">rests[?]</span>
         <span class="hr"> </span>

There are no waggons wheelbarrows; 
go-cart or wheel vehicle
of any kind used in the city
or country <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[unclear, one word]</span> The houses
are brick and fram in the
city proper mostly two storys
high, enclosed by stone fences
The two Suburban towns, viz
Kroo Town and Vie Town are
a part of the corporate limits of
Monrovia The people of these
two precincts are Natives, viz
Kroo-men and Vie-men;
The Post office is in Kroo
Town, which to reach it make
a nice little walk of 2½ miles
from the center of the city
proper. The Kroo and Vie
houses are made of thatches
with dirt floors, and my opinion
is that they are healthier than the
brick home. The Legation building are
the finest and best built house in the
city but like all the brick houses
it is damp and unhealthy and

<span class="hr"> </span>

and there are no exception
to the houses being damp
in the rainy season which
commences in October and
holdes till the first of April.
I am satisfied that for
central location looks and
convienece no better house
could be secured, and as
the lease of it by Mr John H
Smyth had expired some
two years ago and no <del>released</del> renewal
of said lease I have re-leased
it upon the same terms for
two years from Jany first
(1) 1891, which I hope will meet your
approval &amp;c I have the honor to
be your obedient
servant</p>
