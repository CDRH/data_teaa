Sierra Leone, June 2nd 1874.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your
dispatch No 4, saying that representations have been made, 
informing you that delay has been caused in several
instances, by my absence or otherwise, in granting debenture 
certificates.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform you, that to the best 
of my knowledge, nothing of the kind has ever happened; 
and that such representations could only have been made 
by parties wishing for the Consular appointment, or by 
parties with whom I am unfortunately at variance.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg to suggest that you will kindly forward 
to me copies of any letters or documents, which you may 
have received on this subject, to enable me to reply more 
fully, to any statements which may have been made therein, to my detriment.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The difficulties which may have arisen through 
my not having properly affixed the Consular Seal, have 
been caused by my not having the required seal; the only 
one in my possession being the one I use for making
impressions in ink.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have also to acknowledge receipt of Copy of 
Consular Regulations, and Circular No 58, both of which 
shall receive any strict attention.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to remain Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Nathl Lyons<br/>
U.S. Consul for
Sierra Leone &amp;c</p>
