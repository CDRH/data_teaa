<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This copy of A. J. Wauters' July 1891 "Carte L'Etat Independant du Congo" (Map of the Congo Free State) marks Mohun's route through the free state during 1892-1893.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Produced by the Institut National de Geographie in Brussels, the viewer gets a sense of the breadth of Mohun's travels that take him beyond his post at Boma on the Atlantic coast to the interior of the Free State as far as the "hinterland" separating it from German East Africa, noted on the map as "Sph&#xE8;re des Int&#xE9;r&#xEA;ts Allemands" (Sphere of German Interests), which included Lake Tanganyika that separated the two colonies. As an American, Mohun became very familiar with the geography of the Congo Free State, and Western powers recognized his role in producing American knowledge about their colonial projects in Africa.</p>
