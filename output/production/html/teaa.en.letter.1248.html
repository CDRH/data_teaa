      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
say that in answer to a
letter of July 8, 1898, from
J. E. Eminsang Esq. of Almina
Gold Coast Colony,
Africa, informing me of
the death of his father
George E. Eminsang Esq.,
late United States, Commercial
Agent, at Cape
Coast Castle; and in
the same letter petitioning
to be appointed his
father's successor, as United
States Commercial
Agent, at Cape Coast Castle,

<span class="hr"> </span>

I did on the 11th day of
August 1898, appoint the
said J. E. Eminsang Esq.,
temporarily; United States
Commercial Agent, at
the Cape Coast Castle,
Agency, with a request that
I hear from him at an early
date. In reply to my request
and appointment, I have
not, yet heard from him;
I therefore, think him either
too slow or careless to fill
so responsible position, and
de herewith take pleasure in
nominating William F. 
Hutchison Esq., a British
subject of Cape Coast; Gold
Coast Colony, Africa; a
gentleman who is very highly
recommended to me, as
a man of fine parts, possessed
of eminent business
qualities <del>qualities</del>, to fit him
for the position of United States

<span class="hr"> </span>

Commercial Agent, at Cape
Coast Castle. I therefore, nominate
Mr. William F. Hutchison,
for the position and
hope the nomination may
so meet your approval,
as to insure an early
return of the blank oath
of office, accompanied with
a blank official bond.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be 
your obedient servant,<br/>
