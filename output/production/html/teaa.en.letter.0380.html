      <div class="note">Received Department of State
Aug 25 1869</div>

      <p class="tei_p">Commercial Agency of the
United States of America at
Sierra Leone 24th July 1869.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to report to you 
for the Department's information the appearance,
on the 30th ultimo, in this port 
of an American Sloop called the 
"Champion" of 30 31/100 Tons measurement 
of Noank, Connecticut; The 
Captain, William W. Cox, arrived 
at the Isle de Loss, according to his report
coming from Goree, without another soul 
but himself on board, he stated to me 
that

Assistant Secretary<br/>

that in landing near Goree his Boat 
capsized and he lost his Ship's papers, 
however, he deposited with me a properly
authenticated power to sell the Sloop. The 
Crew list he stated was lost and his 
crew had deserted.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The case looks suspicious to me and 
I report it for your investigation.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Captain Cox was very anxious to 
put the Sloop under British Colors but 
not being able to propose a bona fide 
process I refused to do so. He has left 
this port on the 21st instant; destination 
Isle de Loss.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant,<br/>
Rosenbush.<br/>
U.S. Vice Comml Agt:</p>
