Zanzibar, March 21 1889</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Honorable G. L. Rives<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to inform
the Department that the last
mail steamer from Aden brought
one hundred Somalis who have
been engaged by the German
East African Company to help
fight their battles on the coast</p>
      <p class="tei_p">They were not allowed to land
at Zanzibar but were transferred
in one of the Sultan's steamers
to the main land. It is
very doubtful if the Somalis
can be made to fight against
the Coast Arabs being of the
same religion.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the 18th inst I received
a Cablegram from Commander
McCalla of the U.S.S. Enterprise
stating

<span class="hr">Â </span>

stating that he was at Port
Said on his way to Zanzibar
and Madagascar, and asking
if there is any reason why
he should not go first to
Tamatave. As everything 
is quiet here in
Zanzibar at the present time
I see no need of his immediate 
presence in harbor
and I shall probably cable
him to this effect, upon
his arrival at Aden on the
26th inst. recommending
that he time his arrival
at Zanzibar not later than
the first of May.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Seth A. Pratt<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
