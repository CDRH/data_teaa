               <h3>Analysis</h3>
               <p class="tei_p">John A. Kasson held diplomatic posts as U.S. Ambassador to Austria-Hungary from 1877-1881 and to the German Empire from 1884–1885. It was during this latter assignment, that he attended the Berlin Conference (a.k.a. the <em class="hi">Kongokonferenz</em>) of 1884-85 and subsequently persuaded the United States to recognize the sovereignty of the Congo Free State and to ratify the <a href="teaa.en.government.0001" class="tei_ref_type_internal">General Act of the Berlin Conference</a>. Kasson proved successful in the first endeavor, but failed to convince President Cleveland to present the treaty to the Senate for ratification.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">The purpose of Kasson's 1886 article was to convince readers of the necessity for the U.S. Senate to ratify the General Act by the April 1886 deadline. The article opens with a summary of President Cleveland's address in which the president explained his objection to bringing the Act before the Senate based on his belief that the U.S. held "no established interests or control" in the "remote valley of the Congo." Kasson then lays out a detailed summary of what transpired at the conference and the obligations outlined in the Act, emphasizing that the Act does not obligate the United States to commit troops to enforcing freedom of navigation of the Niger and Congo Rivers and free trade in the Congo Basin—the latter a claim made by the State Department. Kasson concludes that in the interest of promoting Christianity, civilization, and commerce in the Congo region, the United States should either ratify the Act or accept it "as a 'separate act' for which it makes provision."<sup>1</sup>

               <p class="tei_p">Kasson was among the few public American voices that encouraged the United States to ratify the General Act of the Berlin Conference. As the article makes clear, the State Department and the President feared that ratifying the Act would bound the country to intervening in foreign conflicts in foreign colonial possessions where the U.S. held no strategic, commercial, or diplomatic interest. Despite the fact that the country was engaged in its own expansion across the continent and overseas in the late nineteenth century (i.e., the "new imperialism"), many U.S. politicians advocated an isolationist foreign policy, with some exceptions made for affairs in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">In contrast, Kasson was an expansionist who believed that the United States should abandon the Monroe Doctrine and pursue territories abroad. Kasson played an active role in the conference, persuading the delegates to adopt British explorer Henry Morton Stanley's boundaries for delineating the Congo Basin. He also encouraged the European powers to respect the rights of Africans and African rulers in deciding if and when to cede their land. Kasson's plea for ratification of the Act constituted one important current in the American discourse on the Africa Question which focused on the potential commercial and economic benefits of the agreement for the United States.<sup>2</sup>

         <p class="tei_p">This declaration constitutes an agreement on the part of all the governments adhering to it that the commerce of each of their nations shall enjoy complete liberty in all the region drained by the Congo and its affluents, including therewith Lake Tanganyika and its eastern tributaries: also in the Atlantic zone lying on both sides of the Congo basin proper between latitude 2° degrees 30' south, and the river Logé, prolonging these lines eastward from the Atlantic until they reach the Congo basin also: in the zone lying eastward of the Congo basin and situate between the 5th degree of north latitude and the river Zambesi on the south and extending to the Indian Ocean on the east. But it was expressly understood that the provisions should only apply to the territories of any independent power in this eastward zone (like Zanzibar) after such Government should give its assent; and the Conference powers agreed to use their influence to obtain this consent.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">[ . . . ]</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The fourth and fifth of the resolutions of the Conference establish an agreement that the two greatest commercial rivers of Western Africa, the Niger and Congo, as well as all artificial water ways or railroads connecting their waters respectively, shall forever remain open to the navigation and commercial use of all nations, on terms of perfect equality. No embarrassing or discriminating regulations shall be applied; and other national interests shall have the same liberty and rights on these rivers as those of the possessory powers. No nation may create a monopoly on either river. This navigation is to remain forever free and open to neutral commerce, even in time of war.</p>
