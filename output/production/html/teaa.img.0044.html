  <p>This map accompanies the article "Africa and the World Democracy: A Report," featured in the February 1919 volume of <em>The Crisis</em>. Described as "How Africa was Divided Up among the Nations of Europe before the War," the map includes a legend showing the colonial possessions of Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. In addition, the image includes estimates of the total square miles and population of each European African empire, as well as the same statistics for the independent states of Liberia and Abyssinia (Ethiopia). The accompanying article begins with the declaration: "Africa must ultimately be returned to the Africans." The article goes on to provide details of the "Pan-African Movement" meeting held at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 6, 1919. This included remarks by William Henry Sheppard who served as a missionary for the American Presbyterian Congo Mission in the Congo Free State. Horace Meyer Kallen, a Harvard-trained philosopher and member of the League of Free Nations, spoke about "the economic cause which lies back of the long and unclean story of atrocities in Africa," focusing on the "greed...of a few men." NAACP Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mary White Ovington, read a cable from W. E. B. Du Bois who was in France attending the Pan-African Congress. NAACP Secretary James Weldon Johnson explained why the NAACP was "interested in the discussion of the African question," noting that the organization concerned itself with "the Negro everywhere." Other presentations followed, and the meeting ended with the writing of a cablegram to President Woodrow Wilson "and a resolution drawn up for the Senate of the United States, urging their consideration of the African question."</p>
