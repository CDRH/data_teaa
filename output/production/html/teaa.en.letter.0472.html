Sierra Leone<br/>
June 2nd 1874</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to request that you will 
furnish this Consulate with a small parcel of 
assorted Stationary and a Consular Seal for
immediate use. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Bark "Albertina" has sailed from this port, 
I believe for Boston, but being under English colors, the 
Consignees did not apply to me for any papers. She 
is commanded by Captain Joseph Upton, and was consigned to Mess Randall and Fisher of this place, 
from Boston, by (I believe) Messrs Roberts and Ridout of 
the latter named place.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to remain<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
Nathl Lyons<br/>
U.S. Consul for
Sierra Leone &amp;c</p>
