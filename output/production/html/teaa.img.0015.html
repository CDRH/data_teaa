  <p>A Yoruba Baptist minister who changed his name from David Brown Vincent in the 1880s, Mojola Agbebi (1860-1917) made a speech at the First Universal Congress of Races held in London in July 1911, where W. E. B. Du Bois also spoke. <em>The Crisis</em> quoted from Agbebi's paper, "The West African Problem," in which he declared, "The problem is twofold. The task of Europe is to establish dominion and an industrial and commercial development. For the African the problem is to see what effect the contact with the whites will have on his life . . . .  European colonization would only gain by a more intimate and sympathetic penetration of those races whose civilization is so different." A friend of African American journalist John E. Bruce, Agbebi served as the inspiration for one of the Yoruba brothers in Bruce's 1907-09 serial novel, <em>The Black Sleuth</em>, set in West and South Africa.</p>
