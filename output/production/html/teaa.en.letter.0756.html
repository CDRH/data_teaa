      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform
you that upon looking
over the Archives of this Consulate
I find two Circulars from the
Department which have not been
complied with to my personal
Knowledge during the past year.
and I would respectfully enquire
if both of said Circulars are now
in full force.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The first is Circular No 56 dated
March 15th 1865 regarding Passports
for all passengers going from
a foreign port to the United States</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The second is Circular No 6<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">4[?]</span>
dated August 22nd 1876 with
Executive Order attached dated
August 8th 1876 and related
to



to Debenture Certificates revising
the Consular Regulations of 1874
and changing the Consular Fee on
Debenture Certificates.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would also respectfully
enquire if half a dozen
different articles can be placed
upon one Debenture Certificate? 
Thereby reducing the Consular Fees
to the minimum.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Sir Your Obt Servt<br/>
