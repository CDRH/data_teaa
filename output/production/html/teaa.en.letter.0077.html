      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It becomes my duty to call your 
attention to the fact that there is a great 
number of Kroomen negroes about the streets 
of this city, who were left here by the 
American Corvette "Sacramento". these men 
give great annoyance to some of the inhabitants, 
principally those of the Bungo neighborhood 
by reason of great noise they make, having 
no regard for the police regulations of the city.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I beg therefore that you will take 
such measures as you think proper to cause 
a stop to be put to the annoyance given by
these men. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">God preserve you.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Loanda 13th, April 1864.</p>
