         <p class="tei_p">1. The dominions of each contracting party as well as the right of

         <p class="tei_p">3. Citizens and protegés of the United States of America will

      <div class="section">
 
         <h3>Article III.</h3>
 
         <p class="tei_p">1. According to the laws of Madagascar from all time, Malagasy lands cannot be sold to foreigners, and, therefore, citizens and protegés of the United States of America are prohibited from purchasing lands in Madagascar; but still they shall be permitted to lease or rent lands, houses, or storehouses for a term of months or years, mutually agreed upon between the owners and United States citizens, not exceeding twenty-five years for one term; but the lessee, or owner of the lease, at the expiration of a term, may, if he should wish to do so, and can agree with the lessor (proprietor of the land), renew the lease by periods not exceeding twenty-five years for any one term; and the conditions agreed upon by the parties for such renewals are to be inserted in the lease.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">However, every renewal must be acknowledged at the time of making it before the proper authorities, as hereinafter provided in sec. 9 of this article for executing leases for lands and houses; and the same fee may be exacted.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">2. United States citizens and protegés shall be permitted to build houses and magazines, of any material desired, on land leased by them, according to the agreement made with the owner; and when the lease contains a condition permitting the lessee to remove the buildings and fixtures so constructed by him, the same shall be removed within three months after the final expiration of the lease; otherwise they shall become the property of the owner of the land.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">3. This privilege of leasing lands and building thereon by United States citizens and protegés shall not be construed as a right to build fortifications of whatever nature, nor to mine on the lands; and should any minerals be accidentally found on such lands, they are to be left to the disposition of Her Majesty's Government, and no agreement will be valid made between parties to avoid this clause relative to minerals.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">4. United States citizens and protegés who wish to lease tracts of unappropriated lands in Madagascar may lease of the Malagasy Government, under the same rules as provided above in this article, secs. 1-3, for leasing lands of Her Majesty's subjects.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">5. United States citizens and protegés shall be allowed to hire laborers, not soldiers, and, if slaves, not without the permission of their masters. And if such hired laborers should desire to leave, they shall be at liberty to do so, and be paid up to the time of leaving on giving one month's previous notice.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">6. This notice, however, shall not be required from the Government of Madagascar, when Her Majesty the Queen shall have immediate and unexpected need of the services of such laborers; but the officers of the Government in taking such laborers for government service will avoid taking the skilled laborers–those who have become habituated to the special avocations in which they are employed–and the permanently employed servants, when the circumstances will admit. And the Queen calling such laborers for soldiers or other pressing government service, shall be considered as the circumstances under which they may be taken without the notice, and paid up to the time of leaving.</p> 

         <span class="hr"> </span>

         <p class="tei_p">The above restriction is intended to prevent the local authorities from taking such permanent laborers from their employers, but not to interfere with the right of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar to call them to government service when needed.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">7. Mail carriers, and bearers of dispatches, and bearers of freight, as well as the servants and bearers of travelers employed by United States citizens and protegés, and provided with passports from the Malagasy Government, will not be taken away while en route, but must be permitted to finish their journeys. Nevertheless, such persons if transgressing the law, will not be exempt from arrest even while on the journey.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">8. Slaves shall be allowed to engage themselves with United States citizens and protegés for short periods, where their masters are far away, or where it, is not known whether they are slaves or not, but if they are demanded by their masters they shall be allowed to leave, and be paid up to the time of leaving, without giving the one month's previous notice.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">9. Contracts for renting or leasing lands or houses, or hiring laborers, shall be executed by leases for lands and contracts for labor in writing which shall be executed before the United States consular officer and the governor of the district where such consular officer resides, or instead of said governor such officer as he may delegate for such duty, who, when satisfied that the parties have the right to make the contract, shall approve it in writing signed by them, and sealed with their official government seals.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">10. And for such service a fee not exceeding two dollars ($2) may be exacted for each official seal. But when the period contracted for, for labor does not exceed six months, procuring this official approval shall be optional with the parties.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">11. And the United States consular officer, as well as the governor of the district where such officer resides, or any other local officer that may be designated by the governor for that purpose, shall approve the same without delay, unless it be in the case of some unavoidable preventing circumstances, or on a day when official business is stayed by the Queen of Madagascar.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">12. On lands so leased by American citizens and protegés, the American lessee shall pay to Her Majesty an annual tax of two cents per English square acre upon lands for cultivation, and on town lands an annual tax of one-fourth cent per English square yard.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">13. This tax shall not be considered as payment in whole or in part of other taxes which may be levied on such United States citizens and protegés, or the citizens and subjects of other nations residing in Madagascar and Malagasy subjects, not of any part of the export duty upon the productions of such lands, but as a special land tax.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">14. This tax shall be paid once each year in the month which shall be fixed by the government for its payment; and the officer who shall be designated to receive such, shall upon reception of each tax give a receipt therefor, over his signature and official seal, mentioning the day, month and year on which it was received, and describing the land upon which the tax is paid, and for what year, as a proof of payment.</p> 

         <span class="hr"> </span>

         <p class="tei_p">15. Such leases may be transferred; in which cases notice must be given to the government authority of Madagascar.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">16. Citizens and protegés of the United States of America who come to Madagascar must present a passport from their government, or from some consul, certifying their nationality; otherwise they are liable to be prohibited from residing in Madagascar.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">17. But after producing such passport, they shall be permitted to follow any occupation they wish; to print books or newspapers of a moral character, or any books or periodicals on literary, commercial or scientific subjects, provided they are not of an unlawful character; but shall not be permitted to publish seditious criticisms upon Her Majesty's Government.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">18. United States citizens and protegés shall be permitted to pass with or without merchandise, with their bearers, baggage, carriers, and servants, through all parts of Madagascar which are under the control of a governor duly appointed by Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar, with the exception of Ambohmianga, Ambohmianambola, and Amparafaravato, which places foreigners are not permitted to enter; and, in fact, be entitled to all privileges of commerce or other business, calling or profession granted to the most favored nation, so long as they do not infringe the laws of Madagascar.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">19. The subjects of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar shall enjoy the same privileges in the United States of America.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">

         <h3>Article IV.</h3>
 
         <p class="tei_p">1. Commerce between the people of the United States of America, and Madagascar shall be perfectly free, with all the privileges under which the most favored nations are now, or may hereafter be trading.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">2. Citizens of the United States of America shall, however, pay a duty not exceeding ten per cent. on both exports and imports in Madagascar, to be regulated by a tariff to be mutually agreed upon.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">3. No other duties, such as tonnage, pilotage, quarantine, or lighthouse dues shall be imposed in ports of either country on the vessels of the other, to which national vessels, or vessels of the most favored nations, shall not equally be liable.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">4. Until Her Majesty the Queen shall decide to collect all duties in money the import duty on American goods may be paid in money or in kind, on each kind of goods, at the option of the owner or consignee, and according to a tariff that shall be agreed upon, not exceeding ten per cent.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">5. This tariff of customs dues shall be drawn up by the United States consul and an officer delegated by Her Majesty's Government for the purpose, within three months after the exchange of the ratification of this treaty, and shall be submitted to the two governments for approval; and the same shall be published within one year from the date of the exchange of the ratification of this treaty. And this tariff may be revised in the same way, in whole or upon any article or articles, at any time, upon the application of either government, should it be found rated too high or too low, in whole or upon any one article or articles of merchandise.</p> 

         <span class="hr"> </span>

         <p class="tei_p">6. In case any article of import or export should be inadvertently omitted from such tariff, the duty levied on such article shall be ten per cent. ad valorem until the proper tariff on the same shall be agreed upon.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">7. United States citizens and protegés are not allowed to import munitions of war into Madagascar, except on orders from Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">8. In regard to alcoholic liquors, the Malagasy Government may regulate the importation according to its pleasure; or prohibit the importation altogether; or limit the importation as required; may levy as high a duty as it may see fit, or make it a misdemeanor to sell or give such liquors to certain classes of its subjects.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">9. And should it be found at any time that any other articles of an injurious nature, tending to the injury of the health or morals of Her Majesty's subjects, are being imported, Her Majesty's Government shall have the right to control, restrict or prohibit the importation in like manner, after giving due notice to the United States Government.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">10. Prohibited from export by the laws of Madagascar are timber and cows. Timber, however, may be exported by Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar, or by her order.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">11. Ports of Madagascar, where there is no military station under the control of a governor duly appointed by Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar, must not be entered by United States vessels for purposes of trade; should they do so, they will be treated as smugglers.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">12. And Her Majesty's Government will not be responsible for dammage by robbery of, or other malfeasance to United States citizens or protegés in districts where there are no governors, nor other officers or soldiers duly appointed by Her Majesty's Government, should such United States citizens go into such districts without special permits.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">13. Goods which have been duly entered and duties paid thereon at a regular port of entry, may be carried to other ports in United States coasting vessels and landed without further payment, on presentation of invoices of the same, duly certified by the chief collector of customs at the port of entry, showing that the duties have been paid.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">14. Vessels entering Malagasy ports which are not ports of entry for the purpose of trade, will be seized; the masters and crews will be treated as smugglers, and the vessel and cargo will be confiscated.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">15. It is further agreed between the high contracting parties that the offering of a forged passport or one surreptitiously obtained, for entry of goods at any of Her Majesty's ports, or being in any manner knowingly concerned in such fraudulent passports or invoices, either by making or buying, or selling the same, or by offering to enter goods by means of the same, shall be considered a felony, and the person or persons found guilty of such an offense, whether American or Malagasy, shall be punished by imprisonment or fine or both according to the aggravation of the offence, as hereinafter provided by Article VI; and this in addition to the penalty for smuggling when goods have been smuggled, or attempt has been made to smuggle, by means of such fraudulent passports or invoice.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">16. United States vessels of war shall be permitted to enter freely into the military ports, rivers, and creeks situated in the dominions 

<span class="hr"> </span>
 
of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar, to make repairs and to provide themselves, at a fair and moderate price, such supplies, stores and provisions as they may from time to time need, including timber for necessary repairs, without payment of duty.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">17. On account of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar's desire to facilitate communication between the United States and Madagascar and thereby to advance commerce between the two countries, the United States Government and United States private steamship companies are hereby granted the privilege to land and deposit coal for the use of the United States Government and private steamers at Tamatave or Mojanga, or both, on land designated by the governor for that purpose, and to take the same away again from time to time for the use of such steamers, without payment of duties or harbor charges of any kind; but a nominal rent of five cents a ton shall be paid per annum as rent for the land on which it may be stored. This privilege shall continue until coal of Madagascar production in sufficient quantity for such steamers can be bought. But should any of the vessels bringing such coal, or any of the steamers taking the same away, bring goods to sell at such port, or take goods from the same, such vessel must pay the same duty and harbor charges as other merchant vessels except on the coal. And should any of such coal be sold in Madagascar, duty must be paid on the quantity so sold.</p> 

      </div>

      <div class="section">

         <h3>Article V.</h3> 

         <p class="tei_p">1. The contracting parties may appoint consular officers of any or of all grades to reside in the dominions of the other, and such consular officers shall be granted all the rights and privileges granted to functionaries of life grades of the most favored nation, as witnesses of the good relations existing between the two nations, and to regulate and protect commerce.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">2. The President of the United States of America may send a diplomatic officer of any grade to reside in Madagascar who shall enjoy the rights and privileges provided by international law for his grade.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">3. The Queen of Madagascar shall have the like privilege of sending a diplomatic officer of any grade to the United States of America, and he shall enjoy there likewise all the rights and privileges of his grade established by international law.</p> 

      </div>

      <div class="section">

         <h3>ARTICLE VI.</h3> 

         <p class="tei_p">1. Citizens and protegés of the United States of America, who enter Madagascar, and subjects of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar, while sojourning in the United States of America, are subject to the laws of trade and commerce in the respective countries.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">2. In regard to civil rights, whether of person or property, of citizens and protegés of the United States of America, where disputes or differences shall arise between them, or in cases of criminal offences committed upon them by each other, they shall be under the exclusive civil and criminal jurisdiction of their own consuls, duly invested with the necessary powers.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">8. Neither shall the Malagasy authorities interfere in differences or disputes between United States citizens and protegés and the citizens or subjects of any third power in Madagascar.</p>

         <span class="hr"> </span>

         <p class="tei_p">4. But the Malagasy police may, whenever a United States citizen or protegé shall be discovered in the act of committing a crime against any person, of whatever nationality, or breach of the peace in any manner, whether by making unlawful disturbance in the streets and public places, or in any manner breaking the published laws of Madagascar, arrest such offender without process and take him immediately before the proper United States consular officer, who will take such action in the case as the circumstances, the laws of the two countries, and the stipulations of this treaty require.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">5. The Malagasy Government will supply to each United States consular officer residing in Madagascar, within six months after the exchange of the ratification of this treaty, one or more printed copies of all laws, decrees, or customs having the force of law which affect in any way, directly or indirectly, foreigners sojourning in Madagascar, in their rights and privileges, either of person or property, for the information of United States citizens sojourning in Madagascar.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">6. And in like manner, whenever any change shall be made in such laws or decrees, or new ones be promulgated, touching the interests of such persons, a like printed copy of the same shall be furnished to each said United States consular officers, at least one month before such change, or new law, or decree shall take effect; and when any such change, or new law, or decree, touches or changes the regulations of the custom-house, or duties to be paid, or the laws in regard to exports and imports, the said copies of such new laws and decrees shall be so furnished at least six months before taking effect against United States citizens.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">7. All disputes and differences arising between citizens and protegés of the United States of America and subjects of Madagascar, and all criminal offences committed by such citizens and protegés against said subjects of Madagascar, and all criminal offences committed by the subjects of Madagascar against the citizens and protegés of the United States of America, as well as all infringement of the laws of Madagascar by the United States citizens and protegés, shall be investigated, tried, and adjudged by "mixed courts," as follows:</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">8. The chief United States diplomatic officer, when there shall be one in Madagascar, or when there is no such officer residing in the kingdom, the chief or senior United States consular officer, and a Malagasy officer, duly appointed by her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar for that purpose, shall constitute a "mixed superior court," which shall be "a court of record," and may hold its sittings at Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, or at Tamatave, according as the circumstances of the business of the court may require.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">9. This superior court shall have both original and appellate jurisdiction; that is, actions may he commenced and decided in it, and it may also try cases appealed from the inferior courts heroin provided for, as follows:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">10. There shall be one inferior mixed court in each United States consular and each United States consular agent's district in Madagascar. Such courts shall consist of the United States consular officer of the district and a Malagasy officer appointed by Her Majesty's Government for the purpose, for each district.</p> 
         <span class="hr"> </span>
 
         <p class="tei_p">11. The inferior courts shall have original jurisdiction of civil cases where the sum claimed does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500) or imprisonment for more than one year or both, as will be more fully explained in the "Code of Rules" of proceedings for the mixed courts, hereinafter provided for.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">12. Appeals from the superior mixed courts may be taken to either of the two governments, at the option of the party appealing, in the manner provided in said "Code of Rules."</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">13. In the trial of actions in these courts, the native judge shall preside and have the prevailing voice in the decisions when United States citizens or protegés are the plaintiff's, and vice versa when they are defendants, that is, when subjects of the Queen are the plaintiffs the United States (consular or diplomatic) officer, as the case may be, shall preside and have the prevailing voice in the decisions.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">14. But the presiding judge shall in every case counsel with and give due weight to the opinions of the associate judge before giving decisions.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">15. It is agreed by the high contracting parties that any attempt to influence the decision of these judges, or any one of them, in a case on trial, or to be decided by them, except by arguments in open court, shall be considered a misdemeanor; and that the offering a bribe to any one of them in money or other object, of value or favor, for the purpose of influencing his decision, shall be considered a felony, and that the person proved guilty of either of these offences shall be punished by the government to which he belongs, according to the grade of his crime. And if it shall be proved that a judge of these courts, of either nationality, shall have received a bribe to influence his decision in any case he shall be dismissed from his office of judge, and otherwise punished according to the laws of his own nation for such malfeasance.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">16. It is further agreed that within six months after the exchange of the ratification of this treaty, that the chief diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, who shall be at the time residing in Madagascar, and one or more officers to be selected by Her Majesty's Government, shall meet and together draw up a "Code of Rules" of proceedings for these mixed courts, which code, when so drawn and signed by said officers, shall be forwarded by them to their respective governments for approval; and when approved by both governments shall be considered a part of this treaty, duly ratified as such. And this treaty, including said code of rules, together with international law, and the laws of the United States of America and of Madagascar, in so far as the latter can be made to harmonize, shall govern proceedings in these courts.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">17. It is agreed that the said "Code of Rules" shall follow, in so far as the laws and present status of things in Madagascar will admit, the rules of proceedings in United States consular courts in Madagascar; that all attestations in the proceedings shall be made under the judicial oath or affirmation of civilized nations; and that the said code of rules shall define how actions shall be commenced and be conducted, the grades of offences and their punishments, under what circumstances arrests may be made, 1md the amount and manner of bail to be taken, the disposition to be made of fines collected, when, 

<span class="hr"> </span>

how, and to whom appeals may be taken, and all other matters necessary for the intelligent working of such courts. And shall also contain forms for writs and other processes, and a tariff of fees.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">18. In all cases of arrest permitted by this treaty now, and to be provided for by the "Code of Rules," the prisoners shall be, during their detention, treated with all the humanity consonant with the laws of civilized nations. Her Majesty's Government will see that they are supplied with wholesome food and drink in sufficient quantity, and detained in healthy quarters, and that they are brought to trial in the shortest time possible consonant with the convenience of the prisoner.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">19. In cases of arrest of American citizens or protegés in the absence of a United States consular officer, or where no such officer resides, the authority causing the arrest shall immediately inform the nearest United States consular officer of the fact and of the circumstance of the case, and also cause the prisoner to be taken as soon as possible before the mixed court of which that nearest consular officer is a judge.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">20. It shall be the duty of the court to encourage the settlement of controversies of a civil character by mutual agreement, or to submit the same to the decision of referees agreed upon by the parties. And in criminal cases, which are not of a heinous character, it shall be lawful for the parties aggrieved or concerned therein, with the assent of the court, to adjust the same among themselves upon pecuniary or other considerations.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">21. Her Majesty's Government will render all assistance in its power to United States citizens and protegés toward collecting their legal claims against Her Majesty's subjects; and United States consular officers will likewise render every assistance in collecting legal claims against United States citizens and protegés.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">22. Whenever it is known, or there is reason to believe, that transgressors against the laws, fugitives from justice, are on the premises of United States citizens or protegés, such premises may be entered by the Malagasy police with the consent of the occupants, or against their consent in company with a United States Consular officer, or with his written order. In case of absence of such United States officers, or in places where no such officers reside, the police may make such entry by the order of the local authority, to look for the offender or stolen property; and the offender, if found, may be arrested, and all stolen property seized.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">23. Murder and insurrection or rebellion against the Government of Madagascar with intent to subvert the same, shall be capital offence, and not bailable; and when a United States citizen shall be convicted by this court of either of those crimes he shall be banished the country and sent to the United States of America for a review of his trial and approval of his sentence and punishment. If a Malagasy subject be convicted by the court of the murder of United States citizen or protegé he shall suffer such punishment as the Malagasy law awards for such crime when Her Majesty, the Queen of Madagascar, shall have approved the judgment of the court.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">24. When a United States citizen shall have been convicted of several minor offences, showing him to be a turbulent and intractable person, he shall, upon the request of the Government of her Majesty the Queen, be banished the country.</p>
