St Paul de Loanda<br/>
30th September 1881</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to 
acknowledge receipt of your
Despatch No 81 stating that
you enclosed copy of W. H. 
Griffith's letter which however
did not come to hand as 
there was no enclosure whatever
in the Despatch.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In reply I have to state
that W. H. Griffiths was duly
discharged before me from the
Whaler "Platina" of New Bedford,
the Master paying into my hands
three months extra wages equal
to $45:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The expenses incurred with 
W. H. Griffiths, were the following.
viz:</p>

      <table class=" tei_table table table-bordered table-condensed">
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">Board &amp; Lodging</td>
            <td class=" tei_td">24.00</td>
         </tr>
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td">Passage per "Bengo" as per Despatch No 68</td>
            <td class=" tei_td">24.30</td>
         </tr>
         <tr class=" tei_tr">
            <td class=" tei_td"/>
            <td class=" tei_td">$48.30</td>
         </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="tei_p">so

<span class="hr"> </span>

so that as his expenses amounted
to more than his 3 months 
extra wages, I did not consider
that he was entitled
to receive anything from this
Consulate.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your most Obedient Servant<br/>
Robt S Newton<br/>
Vice Consul</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
