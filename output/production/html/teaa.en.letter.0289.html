      <p class="tei_p">I have the pleasure to 
forward the Department 
of State, per British brig 
"Emma" a package of the 
"Bean of Calabar", about 10 lbs, 
which I obtained through the 
kindness of the Rev. A. Robb

I enclose, should more be 
required I can obtain them 
from the same source

      <p class="tei_p">Creek Town<br/>
Old Calabar,<br/>
2d May 1864</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I duly received your letter of 12th April, 
desiring, on behalf of the government of the 
United States, a supply of Calabar bean.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have much pleasure in being able 
to comply with your request, and shall 
send per Mail a small box containing 
10 lbs. If Analysis is the object, there 
will probably be too few for any extensive 
experiments. But Mr Baillie says 
that "500 or so would perhaps be enough". 
There are more than that in 10 lbs. I should
think there are at lest 1000. Should
more be needed I shall be happy to 
supply them; such if may be well that you

<span class="hr"> </span>

give me notice without any long delay, lest 
my supply should run out.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By the present mail I learn that 
10/- has been paid per pound in London 
but as these are for scientific purposes
I shall give them for 6/- per pound.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is not out of place to state that 
about four years ago, I supplied some 
of these beans to a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Dr[?]</span> Mitchell in Philadelphia 
who, I understood was engaged 
in an analysis of African ordeals.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The request came to me through one 
of the missionaries at <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Corsica[?]</span> or Gaboon.</p>
 
      <p class="tei_p">I may further state that the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">fullest[?]</span> 
I believe the only, account of the bean
is to be found in a "Graduation Thesis"
published by Messrs Oliver and Boyd, 
Edinburgh. The title is 
"The Characters, Actions and Therapeutic 
Uses of the Ordeal Bean

<span class="hr"> </span>

Calabar (Physostigma Venenosum, Balfour):
A Graduation Thesis, for which a Gold Medal 
was awarded by the Edinburgh University <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Aug 62[?]</span>
By Thomas R. Fraser M.D. Edin, &amp;c . 
It is published in the form of a pamphlet 
and gives a full account of the experiments 
and their results, and also specimen cases
of diseases in which the bean has been 
used as a remedy, with good results.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honour to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Alexander Robb</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">P.S. I may warn you that the bean is a deadly 
poison, and should be kept out of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">way[?]</span> lest 
any accident happen. There is no danger unless 
it be eaten, of course; but I believe that <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">less[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">than[?]</span> one may be a fatal dose. Its native
name is é-ser-e (e, as in met)</p>
