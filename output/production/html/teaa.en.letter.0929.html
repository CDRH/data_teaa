      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to transmit to the Department my Report for the quarter ended March 31, 1876. My extreme illness is the cause of the delay thereof until this late date, and though it contains all the essentials yet it is not such a one as I should like to have transmitted, were it not for the causes above mentioned.</p>

Your most obedient servant<br/>
