            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p class="tei_p">Anna Boardman Smith was a missionary stationed in Africa from 1902 to 1914 at the Kunso Wesleyan Mission and Kono Station in Sierra Leone. She wrote a narrative about her time in Africa to not only "increase...interest in foreign missions throughout" her denomination, but also to target American Christian women specifically. She wrote: "O happy Christian women of America! Can we not do something to lighten the loads of our overburdened sisters in this darkened land?" (183). Smith traveled to Africa with her first husband Willard Boardman, who died at the mission from "a common attack of African fever" (43). She and Willard had both attended the Wesleyan-affiliated Houghton College in New York and evangelized together for three years before they traveled to Africa. After Willard's death, Boardman married another missionary, J. Hal Smith, while at the mission. Smith used her narrative to provide information about specific African peoples, mostly the Temne and Limba, and to persuade her Christian readers that there were "jewels" (converts) to be "gathered" in Africa as a whole, which required evangelists willing to live in—not merely visit—the continent for some considerable amount of time. Smith ended her narrative with "A Plea for Africa," replete with racist, denigrating images of Africans as "heathens" and Africa as "pathetic beyond description" (273). She vouches that everything she has witnessed, felt, and heard in Africa—as relayed in the narrative—is true. Thus, she argued that "God needs our best for Africa" (275). Smith's appeal replicated that belief found in many American and European missionary narratives, which claimed the redemption of Africa could only commence through the continent's Christianity. This was also a refrain in contemporaneous imperialist literature about Africa.</p>

         <h3>Chapter V</h3>
         <h3>The Temne People and Their Customs</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">Sierra Leone is a British Protectorate about
two hundred and fifty miles in width and three
hundred in length. Its area may be roughly compared 
with that of New York State, yet this little
section is the home of many different tribes of people, 
which, in spite of intermarriages and constant 
mingling with one another, still retain their
own distinctive languages and customs. There
are the Temnes, Lokos, Limbas, Mendis, Kissis,
Konnahs, Manicas, Sherbros, Kurankos, and others. 
Tribal wars were very common in years
past; the object being either for revenge or conquest, 
whatever captives were taken then became
the slaves of the conquerors.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Temne people, who are said to possess a
more warlike disposition than many others, seem
to have come into that section some time in former 
years, crowded the Lokos to the right and
left, and taken up their permanent abode in this
conquered territory. These people do not manifest
the striking negro characteristics of the Africans
who live farther to the South. The exceedingly
flat noses, thick lips, and receding foreheads are
rarely met with. They bear a greater resemblance 
to the Arab type, and a foreigner is often
surprised at the finely shaped heads and beautiful
features he finds among this dusky race.</p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">The Temnes are rather smaller in stature than
the average American and seldom fat in flesh.
The reason for this, as some of them have told
us, is that they do not have sugar to eat, and as
proof cite us to some of the fat "daddies" and
"mammies" of Freetown who are able to live partially 
on sweets.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">A stooped person can scarcely be found among
these people. They are generally as straight as
arrows, as a natural result of carrying burdens on
their heads. They do not have horses, mules,
oxen or wagons, so the best all-round place for
transporting articles of every kind seems on the
top of their wooly heads. It is amazing to see
how skilful they are in balancing articles and how
much safer they are carried on the head than in
the hands or on the shoulders. The smallest
girls in the mission school will place our Bibles
and singing books on their heads and hold up
their dresses as they wade the deep streams that
they must cross as they accompany us on our
itinerating tours. They never let the books fall.
An African man will carry a load with comparative 
ease that he must have help in raising to his
head and in letting down again at the end of
the journey. A cloth pad or wisp of grass is
generally used as a cushion between the head and
the burden unless it be of light weight. We are
amused sometimes to see how an umbrella is
laid across the head in preference to carrying it
in the hand or under the arm and a bottle is

<span class="hr"> </span>

stood straight up on top of the head. A woman
will carry her baby on her back, fastened on with
the "lappa" which is brought around and tucked
in at the front, and at the same time carry a large
bundle of wood on her head or a large iron cooking 
pot with calabashes heaped together on top
of that. I once saw one of our girls set a large
pitcher of water on her head and then sitting
down on the floor she hitched herself along from
the kitchen to one of our bedrooms, just to show
us how nicely she could balance it.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The Temnes do not live on their farms the
year round as Americans do but huddle together
in towns. This custom may have originated from
the native desire for society, from the need of
protection from wild beasts and invaders in the
old days of tribal wars, or for all three of these
reasons.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The towns are not large but usually near together, 
the distance between them varying from
one to four or five miles and much more in the
large grass-fields. A town which a man would
walk a mile in passing would be among the very
largest that their country boasts. They cannot
comprehend what one of our smaller cities is like
to say nothing of New York whose population is
some thirty or forty times as large as that of the oy
entire Temne tribe.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The towns are invariably surrounded by a strip
of woods filled with a dense undergrowth and
thick vines, and served as good hiding places

<span class="hr"> </span>

from the war-boys when a hostile tribe was invading 
their country. There seems to be no
special plan in the laying out of their towns.
Each man builds wherever he choses or wherever
he can secure a building spot. A small ditch is
dug in circular form, enclosing as large a space
as is desired for the size of his house. Long
poles are next brought and set up in this ditch
a few inches apart and then the strong bark of
a vine is used to tie the sticks securely to place.
This vine rope is tied to one of the sticks,
brought to the next and wrapped around and to
the next and next till they have gone entirely
around; then beginning again, a little above the
former place, they tie around. Thus round and
round they go till it is tied to the very top. If
some of the up and down sticks happen to be
longer than the others, they are trimmed off
evenly, the places for the doors are cut out (the
African does not consider the subject of windows) 
and the frame is ready for the "mudding."
A suitable place near by is chosen for mixing the
mud, the earth is dug up with little hoes till it is
light and in a good working condition, water is
brought in calabashes and wooden tubs and the
mixing begins. The men jump into it with both
feet and tread it till the earth and water are
thoroughly mixed together. It if then happens
to be a little too dry more water is put on and if it
is too wet, as is more often the case, more earth,
until it is of the proper consistency. It is then

<span class="hr"> </span>

made up into large balls and all the open places
in the framework are filled and then it is left to
dry for several days. As soon as it has become
dry enough for further operations more balls are
made and the mud is plastered onto the outside
and inside till the wall is from nine to twelve
inches thick. A good smoothing and final rubbing
with a finer kind of clay finishes the wall ready
for the roof. The first thing to be done in putting 
on a native roof is to lay strong sticks across
the top of the walls and erect a heavy stick, the
bottom of which rests on the cross beams and
the top sticking straight up into the air. This is
supposed to be placed in the very center and
forms the "katuli" or main post of the house. A
small frame work is made called a "spider" and
fastened around the "katuli" near the top, after
this is properly adjusted strong bamboo sticks
are handed up, one by one, and tied to place over
the end of the "katuli" while the opposite ends
project downward in every direction and rest on
the top of the walls. The office of the "spider"
is to strengthen the bamboo sticks and hold them
out to their places. Now the vine ropes are
again required and the bamboo rods are tied
round and round beginning from the top and
using strong pliable sticks to lay around both over
and under the bamboo rods to strengthen the
roof and hold all to its proper position. The
tying continues till the lower edge of the roof is
reached when the sticks are trimmed off evenly

<span class="hr"> </span>

and a large roll of the pliable sticks bound on for
a good finish. Grass is used in lieu of shingles,
being laid on thickly and tied to place by the
vine rope. The roof usually projects far out over
the wall and furnishes shade for a wide veranda.
A low wall is built up to enclose. the veranda
and the floor is filled in with earth to a depth of
one or two feet. Sometimes the outer wall is
built high enough to reach the eaves of the house
and then being enclosed on either side forms a
nice little room called a "konko" and is used for
a sleeping room or a place to keep chickens,
sheep or goats.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The furniture of the native homes consists of a
hammock, fiber baskets, calabashes which are
made from large gourds, wooden bowls, one or
two iron cooking pots, a wooden spoon, and sometimes 
a few tin cans from the mission which are
used as drinking cups. The beds are composed
of a solid bank of mud, heaped up along the sides
of the room and smoothed over on the top, and
a straw mat. If there are not beds enough to
accommodate the whole family the mats are
spread down on the mud floor which is about as
comfortable a place as the bed. The covering of
a native by night is often the garment he or she
has worn by day. Some of the better class afford
blankets.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The people are very fond of building fires on
the floor in the middle of the room and there
being no place for the smoke to escape one would

<span class="hr"> </span>

almost conclude that if these folks were not
naturally of a dark color they soon would be.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The native food is rice. Rice on Sundays and
week days, bright days or dull days, no matter
how much else he has the native will never say
he has really eaten unless he has had his rice.
Palm oil, a product of the oil palm, supplies the
place of butter and is the main seasoning of the
dressing used on the rice. Usually meat, native
greens, squash, egg-plant, okra, or other native
vegetables are mixed in with the dressing or
several of them together. The rice and dressing
are cooked separately in iron pots resting on three
stones and under them is built a fire of sticks.
When all is done the rice is taken up into a
calabash or bowl, the gravy is poured over it the
men gather round squatting on the ground or
sitting on handy stones, and the dinner is quickly
dispatched. A small portion is left in the dish
for the women and children, or sometimes dealt
out to them in a side dish. Occasionally a man is
kind enough to let his whole family eat out of the
same dish with him. The hand forms the conveyance 
from the calabash to the mouth and it
is truly amazing to a foreigner to see the size of
the mouthfuls they take and the rapidity with
which they eat. Every one is obliged to eat as
fast as he can in order to be sure of his share.
The best fellow is the one who can do the best
job of cramming. Dish washing is a matter of
little moment to the Temne woman. The iron

<span class="hr"> </span>

pots are put to soak, the calabash perhaps sent
to the "water side" where it is rinsed and brought
back full of water, and the knives, forks, and
spoons are taken care of when the palm-oily hands
are rubbed off on the posts or walls of the house.
Sometimes the hands are well washed with water.
The African never eats breakfast. Two meals a 
day are supposed to suffice them and the foreigner
who becomes familiar with their eating capabilities 
does not doubt that it is enough. The native
can work longer and harder on an empty stomach 
than any other type of man we ever saw and
can do equally as well at eating when once he
gets a chance.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The climate of Sierra Leone is such that the
people do not need a great amount of clothing.
In fact it is burdensome to wear more than is
actually necessary. The equator is only eight and
one half minutes away and the thermometer on
the very coldest mornings of the year seldom goes
down to sixty degrees. The people know nothing
of snow and ice except what they hear from the
white people and even then they are somewhat
inclined to be incredulous. When one white man
told them that the water in his country became
so thick on top at certain times of the year that
it would bear up an elephant, they said, "The
white man he done lie too much." One of the
"up country" natives once while in Freetown had
a piece of the manufactured ice given to him and
put it in his pocket wishing to keep it. A little

<span class="hr"> </span>

later he looked and finding it gone supposed that
some one had taken it from him. In such a hot
climate as this much clothing is exceedingly burdensome. 
The children, until grown to young
manhood and womanhood, wear very little clothing 
and many of them nothing at all. They are
fond of clothes, however, and are almost continually 
begging us to give them cloth. It is
sometimes pathetic to hear those naked little
fellows plead their case and say, "O Ya, you
have so much and we have nothing at all!" They
are grateful for just any old rag we have to spare
and indeed we give away all the old clothes we
have and as much new stuff as we feel we can
spare money to buy for them and have brought
up country, but it does not go far toward clothing 
all the children in the country. We occasionally 
find some work for them to do and let them
earn money to buy their own clothing. Once a
lot of old second-hand things were sent to the
mission from America. It does not really pay
to send such things for the cost of shipping and
duty would buy more and better stuff in Freetown. 
These came, however, and at Christmas
time we took our arms as full as we could carry
them of old shirt waists, dresses, skirts, aprons,
shirts, and drawers, and went down town. When
the children saw us coming they gathered around
in a regular stampede, pulling at me and at each
other, wildly gesticulating and begging for a garment. 
I know not how I should have managed

<span class="hr"> </span>

had not the chief of the town come to my rescue
and held them back while I sized them up and
gave out the garments that seemed best suited to
the various ones. They were much delighted
and began putting the things on right there in
the street. They were all unused to such garments 
and did not know how to put them on. A
shirt waist would perhaps be put on as trousers,
the sleeves forming the legs; a dress skirt hung
around the neck, and aprons hind side before.
They were an interesting looking crowd when
once dressed up. Then I started back for the
mission and they fell into line and followed me.
The sight brought the other missionaries out to
the porch of the mission house and afforded them
an occasion for many a smile. Dear little ones!
How would we feel if it were our boys and girls?
Then surely we would see the pathetic side of it!
These are just as dear to the heart of the Master
as our own loved ones and for them He died. I
gave them all a good treat of sugar lumps and
sent them home rejoicing.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The dress of a Temne man, if he be among that
class who are fortunate enough to possess any,
consists of a loose shirt, or "ruma," and a pair
of trousers. There are several styles of "ruma."
One is a large robe reaching nearly to the feet,
made of thick native cloth and always having a
prodigious pocket sewn across the front. The
one pocket must fill the place of a dozen in an
ordinary white man's uit and it is well to have it

<span class="hr"> </span>

of ample proportion. These robes are worn
mostly by the country fathers and the pocket is
a good place for them to carry their treasures.
Another "ruma" is made of white or dark cloth
purchased in Freetown, reaching below the knees
and has large flowing sleeves. Another is made
in similar style but of shorter length and with
tight sleeves, while still another is the "buba"
made of one piece with a hole cut for the head
to pass through. The trousers are always of a
loose style and gathered at the waist with a
string. It is astonishing to see how much cloth
some of the "big men" put into a pair of trousers.
One of the missionaries measured a pair that
happened to be hanging on the line in the mission 
yard one day, and found them to be more
than sixteen yards around the waist. A loin
cloth and Freetown cap or Temne hat completes
the costume of a man. Most of the "big men"
of the country wear sandals when they travel.
The rest go bare foot. The "dudes" are very
fond of some article of the white man's apparel
and it is comical as well as pitiful to see some
smart young fellow sporting little else than a
bright red or green waist-coat which he has purchased 
in Freetown or of some travelling trader.
In one case it was a loin cloth and stand up
collar and thus attired the fellow went to church.
Do you think the missionaries never smile?</p>
         <p class="tei_p">A Temne woman's dress is a piece of cloth
about two yards long and a yard and a half wide

<span class="hr"> </span>

and of various texture, figure and color. This is
draped about her person and tucked in at the
chest or waist. No pins, hooks, or buttons are
used in fastening her clothing. She simply tucks
it in and there it stays. It is quite an art to learn
how to do this correctly. A square yard of cloth
laid off in large checks, usually forms the head
covering. Sometimes this is of white, and sometimes 
of many colors. The corner of this square
piece is folded back and then it is drawn tightly
around the head, the ends crossed at the back,
brought round to the front and tucked in; the
other corners hang down at the back and protect
the nape of the neck from the heat of the sun.
We venture to say that when the African woman's
head dress is compared with the American styles
of 1909, the former is far more sensible; nor have
the African men, so far as we know, ever found
it necessary to enact laws to protect themselves
from the inconvenience caused them by the
women's head decorations, as the men of Illinois
are said to have lately done.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The dusky belle is as fond of ornaments as her
white sister. Beads, rings, bracelets, anklets and
ear rings are used in abundance. Great numbers
of charms are also worn. Some of the young
women have all their front teeth filed to a point
which is upposed to add considerably to their
beauty. Many of them have gashes cut in the
flesh in fanciful figures, and then, as they heal, the
raised scars remain. This form of decoration

<span class="hr"> </span>

reaches from the breast down over the abdomen.
I saw one woman who had the cuts freshly made.
She agreed to let me count them and I found
them to be nearly three hundred in number.
Cruel gashes they were and any one of them
would be painful. What tortures will women
not endure for the sake of what is called beauty?
We smile at their customs and count them barbarous 
while they laugh outright at the idea of
wearing feathers as trimming on a hat, and point
mischievously to the ridiculously small waists of
the women whose pictures they see in the papers
and magazines that come to us. Oh for a greater
appreciation, both there and here, of "The ornament 
of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the
sight of God of great price!"</p>

      <div class="chapter">
         <h3>Chapter VI</h3>
         <h3>The Temne People and Their Customs–Continued</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The Temne people live in a land of continual
summer. There are but two seasons–the rainy
and the dry. The rainy season begins as Spring
is opening in the temperate climates; an occasional
shower comes in April, more of them in May, and
thus they increase till the months of July and
August when there are heavy rains almost every
day, the streams are swollen, many of the bridges
washed away, and traveling becomes difficult. In
September the rains slacken a little and gradually 
decrease till December when they cease
altogether and everything becomes parched and
dry. The "dries" are much more trying than the
"rains" as the Harmattan winds from the Great
Sahara Desert sweep over this section wilting
and withering vegetation while the membrane of
our noses and throats becomes dried and parched,
our lips crack and bleed, and the skin of our faces
is chapped and rough. I recall one time on ship
board while coming up the coast of Sierra Leone,
one of the ship's officers called our attention to
the fine dust which covered the starboard of the
ship and told us it was carried there by the
Harmattan winds from the Great Desert and
that we were sailing nearly a hundred miles from

<span class="hr"> </span>

the coast. The latter part of the "rains" is very
hard on our belongings for almost everything
moulds. One of the months of this season is
often called "Mufar" in the Temne language
which means "to be mouldy." Dark woolen or
worsted dresses if worn and then hung away soon
present great splotches of mould. Our shoes, if
set away for two or three days become "a sight."
. . . Our leather bound Bibles must be kept in the
most constant use in order to keep the covers
from being covered with mould both within and
without.</p>
         <span class="hr"> </span>
         <p class="tei_p">The African planting season corresponds very
nearly to that of our own Northern States. A
man of wealth or position does not pretend to
till the ground with his own hands but sends his
slaves to do it, and his wives, except it be the
favorite one, and he has a sufficient force without
her. The very first move in "making a farm" is
to go in with cutlasses and cut down the bushes
which have been growing for some two to four
years and let it dry in the hot sun. Then a wide
swath is cleaned out all round the border of the
field and the farm is ready for the burning. A
time is chosen when the wind is not likely to
blow and carry the fire over onto the next farm,
men are stationed in various places around the
field to fight fire if need be, and then the torch
is applied. It is a great sight to see a farm burned.
The tall dry grass and brush furnish ready fuel
and the gleaming tongues of fire and curling
black smoke are something more terrible than
we have ever before witnessed and give us a fair
idea of what the prairie fires must have been on
our Western plains. Great numbers of greedy
hawks circle around in the smoke and dart down
suddenly upon the helples field mice and other
small animals who are terror stricken and struggling 
to find a place of safety. Men and boys
walk over the fields as soon as the fire has gone
out and gather up such charred remains as the
hawks have left and take them home for a stew.
I once had a peep into the well filled cloth sack

<span class="hr"> </span>

that a man was carrying away from our freshly
burned farm. I think there were more mice and
rats than I ever saw before at one time and one
poor baby porcupine with his quills all burned
off. The man looked happy for he was anticipating 
a good full supper that night. A boa-constrictor 
was once burned to death on our farm and
the mission boys enjoyed a feast from it. They
had heard the white people express their horror
at the idea of eating an animal of this kind, but
they had no more than finished till one of the
white men came around behind the house and
elevating his nostrils asked, "What is it that
smells so good?" Of course they would not tell
about it till long afterwards, and then they would
always smile at the white man's saying it smelled
so good.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">When the land is ready for plowing the people
turn out with their little hoes, the blades of which
are two or three inches wide and handles probably
two feet long, and with these the ground is dug
up and prepared for receiving the seed. The
Temnes like best to work in large companies and
two or three of the number are chosen to drum
and make music for the others to work by. The
work always seems to be done much more pleasurably 
and easily when they can keep time to
the music with the stroke of their hoes. If the
company is too small to afford musicians then
each must sing and furnish his own music.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">After the earth is thoroughly prepared the rice

<span class="hr"> </span>

is sown and cassava, corn, cotton, Guinea corn or
mayenti are planted in the same field all mixed
in with the rice. Now comes a little respite in the
farmer's work except as some member of the
family is obliged to stay in the field from early
morning till evening to drive away the rice birds
who seem bent on having a good meal, if possible,
at the farmer's expense. Once or twice during
the season weeding must be done. Slaves, women
and children go at it with a song and quick work
is made of it. In the months of August and
September the reaper's songs are heard on every
side as they cut the rice with curved knives, bind

<span class="hr"> </span>

it into small sheaves and hang it upside down
on the stumps and stubs to dry. Later it is
gathered, threshed and cleaned and the new rice
is ready for use.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We have said in a previous chapter that the
natives do not live on their farms. They erect
little houses six or eight feet in diameter, of palm
leaves or grass which answer their every purpose.
They give shelter from the rain or hot sun when
some one wishes to rest, and furnish a large
enough place to do the cooking. Sometimes the
people spread down their mats and sleep there at
night if the town is far away or the occasion
otherwise calls for it. It is a common sight all
through the farming season to see men, women,
and children, going out to the farms with their
hoes, cutlasses, calabashes, cooking pots, and indeed, 
nearly all their belongings which they dare
not leave behind for fear of thieves. Little coops
of bamboo splints are made for the chickens
which are taken with the family to the farm each
morning and back at night.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Farming sacrifices are usually offered early in
the season and may be of chickens, sheep, goats,
or other animals. Only a small portion of the
flesh is actually used in the sacrifice: the remainder 
is eaten by the people. Gree-gree charms are
also strung up at the entrance to the farm. These
means are supposed to insure good crops and
protect the farms from intruders and thieves.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Circumcision is practiced among the Africans

<span class="hr"> </span>

of our entire section and is adhered to as rigidly
as ever among the old Hebrews. Almost no
greater insult can be offered to a man than to
call him the name which means uncircumcised or
unclean. A big dance often attends the "going
into the bush." It is held out in the open air by
the light of the moon or blazing bonfires and
continues all night and perhaps a part of the
following day. I once attended a dance of this
kind that was held in the town of Kunso. It
was the first dance I ever went to in my life and
I did not feel at all inclined to take part nor to
prolong my stay. On this occasion the boys or
young men who were to receive the rite went to
the home of some friend or relative and were
brought back in great honor, being carried in
hammocks and attended by a concourse of people.
Detachments went out from the dance to welcome
them and bring them in. They were borne about
on the hands or shoulders of the people and then
put down to the ground and expected to dance,
while the people fall back forming a circle and
watch him till he is weary. He is then taken and
put into a hammock and the young ladies gather
round to fan him with their head kerchiefs and
sing songs in his praise till he is sufficiently
rested to dance again. Experienced dancers from
a distance are present on such occasions and
charm the crowd with their jingling music and
inimitable leaping and contortions. When in
their eagerness the people press too near the

<span class="hr"> </span>

dancers, some big man grabs a bunch of grass,
lights it in the fire and with all the power of his
big voice commands them to fall back, at the same
time waving the burning grass about wildly and
whipping it about the bare legs and feet till they
are glad enough to fall back and the circle is
made wide enough.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">During the days of "hiding" the circumcision
boys live in a small grass of palm-leaf house in
some secluded place and when they are ready to
come out to the public are dressed in long brown
robes of native weave, and adorned with 
fantastic headgear, beads, bracelets, buttons, rings,
charms, and whatever other toggery can be contributed 
by the numerous friends.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The boys of the mission school have long had
this rite performed at or near the mission and
under the care of the white men, and come out
dressed in neat clothing suited to the occasion.
Some young men even outside of the mission
have desired to come and receive their rite along
with the mission boys where they might escape
the evils associated with the native "bush." We
hope that the whole system may in time be
transformed.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">All the girls of the country, somewhere between
the ages of four and sixteen years, are initiated
into the Bondu society which is a strongly established 
secret order of the women. Here they
receive the rite of female circumcision and are
taught the secrets of maternity connected with

<span class="hr"> </span>

more or less of witchery and superstition. The
girls are first daubed all over with white clay
and are a ghostly looking company, then they are
taken away to the woods where they remain for
many days. The whole conditions connected
with this initiation are such as to inspire awe
and fear in the hearts of young girls and they
come out with ideas impressed upon their minds
which no amount of Christian training seems
utterly to erase. The coming out from the 
seclusion of the Bondu bush is the great event of
a girl's life. She is washed and anointed over all
her body with oil and native perfume which is a
compound of fragrant barks and leaves, adorned
with all the ornaments that can be collected and
clothed with a white headkerchief and a mass of
beads worn about the loins with tassels of cloth
at the front and back reaching to the ankles.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It was a hard task to break the ancient custom
and receive their rite at the mission where they
would. be under our own care and influence. The
girls seemed determined to go to the Bondu society 
at any cost and would run away and cause
us a great deal of trouble. At last Carrie Bossworth
consented to have her rite at the mission and we
did all we could to make the occasion a happy
one. When she came out she was clad in a
pretty white dress and white headkerchief made
expressly for the event and we thought her the
finest specimen of African beauty we had ever
looked upon. The natives themselves admired

<span class="hr"> </span>

her and we were glad to believe that many
others would willingly follow her example.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">A strong secret order exists among the men of
Africa called the Poro. This society exerts a
powerful political influence in the country and
was the source of the uprising a few years ago in
which so many of the American United Brethren
missionaries met their deaths. It is impossible
to tell much about the inner workings of this
order as no one dares to reveal its secrets. Not
all of the members unite "of their own free will
and accord" for young boys are caught and carried 
away to the Poro bush where they are kept
for weeks or months at a time until fully initiated
into the mysteries of the organization. Their
young minds are some way filled with a fear
which never leaves them. At MaKomp, one of
the Alliance mission stations, some of the boys
were caught while going home from their night
school at the mission. In fact all of the schools
that were established at the near by towns were
broken up and the mission work greatly hindered.
The powers of darkness were fearful for a time.
I heard one of the white ladies say that as they
walked the roads at evening time she drew up
closely to her husband for the very air seemed
filled with evil spirits. Even her brave husband
confessed that things were very "spooky," and
both of these people are far from being cowards.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">When a boy is decided upon as a subject for
the Poro society the Poro men suddenly appear

<span class="hr"> </span>

in the town where he lives and demand that he
be given up. If they are refused threats are
made and violent measures taken and the people
are frightened and compelled to yield; then the
boy is taken and carried away amidst great excitement 
and the hideous barking and yelling of
the Poros. We are told that the "big man" of
the society, or Poro Devil; goes through some
kind of performance which is counted as a new
birth to those who are being initiated and ever
afterward they are considered as his children and
must be obedient to his word. We are also told
that a human being is killed and each new member

<span class="hr"> </span>

must take his oaths upon a piece of the flesh
and afterward eat the flesh. Just how true this
all is we do not know but we do know that a
Poro man greatly fears to disobey the orders of
his society.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We have already intimated something concerning 
the government of Sierra Leone. It is a
British Protectorate. A colony is established at
the coast and the remaining territory is divided
into districts which are presided over by District
Commissioners sent out from the Mother Country.
The expense of government is met by a tax
levied upon the Africans and called the "hut tax."
It provides that for every hut erected a certain
amount must be paid annually.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">In the Temne country there are native rulers
called the kings and Alamamis. Just what the 
duties of the one are as distinguished from the
other we have never been able to tell definitely.
The Alamamis seem always to be Mohammedans
and I have an idea, which may be far from a
right one, that this is a blending of the native
and Mohammedan powers. These men jointly
bear rule over sections and are each assisted by
a dozen men, it may be more or it may be less,
which they have chosen as their associates in the
government. The king's men are called the
Kopras and the Alamami's men Santikas.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">When we were first on the field the king of
our section had died and his head counsellor,
called the Oruk, was ruling till another king

<span class="hr"> </span>

should be chosen and installed in office. The
making of a new king took place during our stay
and we learned many of the interesting things
connected with it of which are as follows: When
a man is informed that he is the one chosen to
be king he runs away to another tribe but not so
far but that he is easily found and brought back
with great pomp and display. The home bringing
of the king elect is a time of general rejoicing
and lawlessness. Any chickens, goats, sheep, or
cattle that chance to be in the way and farming
produce as well, are seized for the men to feast
upon and the owners can obtain no redress.
When the people of Kunso supposed the king's
party were to pass through their town, they
brought their live stock and picketed it out around
the place saying that no one would dare to molest
whatever was left in the hands, of the white
missionaries. The people told us that sometimes
on this home journey the royal candidate is
treated very hardly. It is the last chance of the
common people to oppress him, so they set him
down in a line of the fierce driver ants or otherwise 
ill treat him so that he may have a taste of
oppression and will not be too hard on them
when he has come into power. Arriving at the
proper town the king elect goes into seclusion
where he is surrounded by the old fathers of the
country and for weeks instructed in the laws and
customs of the land. The "biggest day" of all is
the one when the king is "pulled" or brought out

<span class="hr"> </span>

from hiding and permitted to take his place as
legitimate ruler. His insignia is given to him
which is an elephant's tail. His Kopra insignias
are long brushes made from the fiber of the palm
leaves.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The kings derive a good share of their revenue
from a system of fines which are imposed upon
the people from various causes. If a man falls
from a palm tree and dies or is fatally bitten by
a snake or caught by an alligator or dies some
other violent death, then his relatives or the
people of his town are obliged to pay a fine of
three or four pounds to the king. If a child is
born out on the farm and dies before the parents.
are able to get it to the town then they must pay
a fine. If the king is visiting in a town and sees.
a snake, then the people of that town must pay
him a fine. There is an interesting system of unwritten 
laws which the people of the land seem
to understand very well. Indeed, they are so
often applied that there seems no reason why they
should not be understood. The Kopras and Santikas 
manage the smaller "palavar" cases, the
greater ones go to the kings and Alamamis and
those that cannot be satisfactorily settled by the
natives go to the English District Commissioner.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Polygamy is commonly practiced among the
Africans. Every man is supposed to have as
many wives as he can afford to buy. There is
no marriage ceremony whatever, simply the talking 
of the case and paying of the price, just as

<span class="hr"> </span>

Americans would do in buying cattle and horses.
The money is called a marriage dowry and some
of the more civilized natives rather object to the
terms "buying" and "selling" wives, yet it practically 
amounts to that for the man does not get
his wife without paying the price. The value of
wives varies from five dollars to twenty-five dollars 
according to the quality or age of the woman.
When a man has secured three wives he does
not feel obliged to work any more for they are a
sufficient number to support him and themselves.
These wives sometimes live together in one
house and sometimes in separate houses built
around a compound.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The "big men" generally have scores of wives.
I once asked the grown daughter of an Alamami
how many her father had and she tried to count
them but in vain. She could not tell how many
he had and I almost doubt if some of these men
themselves could tell the exact number. King
Suluku of the Limba tribe would have compared
well with Solomon in this respect. I once asked
a man who had been visiting this king how many
wives he thought Suluku had and he said he did
not know but believed there must be a thousand
for his addition to the number that year were
sixty young girls just out of the Bondu society.
Many of them are probably wives only in name.
The "big men" do not always buy their wives
but receive them as gifts. Men with daughters
of marriagable age frequently take one of them

<span class="hr"> </span>

clothed in her very best ornaments, and presents
her to his king. It is quite an honor to be the
father-in-law of such a great man and a fortunate
thing to have claim to his help whenever any
difficulty arises. Of course a king can not refuse
such a gift and he accepts the girl and presents
the father with a sheep, goat, or cow, in recognition 
of the kindness.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Some have argued in favor of polygamy for
the African because of the women being far more
numerous than the men. Since the tribal wars
have ceased and the people are settling down to
better habits of industry and peace, the sexes may
in time become more nearly equal in number and
this ground for difficulty be removed.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Since wives are in such demand in Sierra Leone
there are few "old maids" to be found. I never
knew but one and she was not bright in her mind
and no man wanted her. These people cannot
conceive of a woman's living single from choice.
One of the embarrassing questions often put to
our lady missionaries is "Where is your husband?" 
When they reply that they have none
the natives freely express their sympathy which
they are surprised to find so little appreciated.
One lady was asked why she did not have a husband 
and turned the question away by jokingly
remarking that she could not find one, whereupon
they volunteered to help her find one.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The saddest part of African marriages is to see
a little girl, from three to ten years of age, bargained

<span class="hr"> </span>

gained away to some man who is old enough to
be her grandfather and who already has a multitude 
of wives. When she is old enough she must
go to him and be his wife whether she loves him
or not. There is no escape. She cannot run
away, for what refuge is there for such an one?
She can easily be found anywhere in her own
small tribe and brought back and severely punished. 
Should she go farther she will Le among
another tribe whose language is perhaps all
strange and new to her. She is the property of
her husband and she must yield and go to him.
But wait, there is one way of escape yet open to
her. She knows of some poison bark or leaves
that grow out in the bush. A draught is easily
prepared and it will soon put an end to her
troubles. What a sad, sad end! but sometimes
a girl prefers it to going to live with a man whom
she does not and cannot love.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">O happy Christian women of America! Can
we not do something to lighten the loads of our
overburdened sisters in this darkened land?
When these people are once Christianized then
these foul wrongs shall be done away. May God
speed the glad day!</p>

         <h3>Chapter VII</h3>
         <h3>The Temne People and Their Customs–Continued</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">The institution of slavery still exists among
the African people and it is a sad and cruel thing
to see men holding in bondage those of their own
race and color. There are three classes of slaves.
Those born in bondage, those taken as captives
in the wars, and those sold outright or put out
as pledges and then the parents failing to meet
the obligation the children are left as slaves in
the hands of their creditors. The tribal wars
have now ceased and no more captives are taken.
The English laws have made it a crime to sell
or pledge human beings and the institution is
now fed only by those who are born of slave perents. 
The English government now provide that
any bondman, it matters not by what method he
has become enslaved, may secure his freedom by
the payment of four pounds to his master. The
price for children is still less. It is hard for a
slave to save any money for his time belongs to
his master, but they usually enlist the sympathies
of the white missionaries who are quite sure to
find out some way to assist them. The mission
does not run what could exactly be called an
"underground railroad" but it does help many a
poor slave to obtain his freedom.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It is sometimes the case that a man takes one

<span class="hr"> </span>

of his slaves for a wife and she is called a slave-wife. 
I was acquainted with two such women
in the town of Kunso. One was Ya Wettie and
her husband had three more wives who lived at
other places. His plan seemed to be to go to see
one and stay till her small stock of provision was
nearly or quite exhausted then go to the next and
next. Ya Wettie had hard work to support her
family of small children but she would double
her diligence when the time of her husband's
coming drew near and manage some way to get
rice and other food for his entertainment. She
did not have very good clothing and our hearts
were so moved to pity for her that we gave her
a new "lappa" to wear on Sundays when she
came to the services. Imagine our feelings then
when we went down town on Sunday morning to
visit some of our old women, and found Ya
Wettie's indolent husband out parading the
streets with her new "lappa" wound about him.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The other woman was Tobra's mother who was
taken captive in a tribal war long ago when she
was young in years. Her husband and child ran
away and escaped into the bush but she was
brought back as a slave and became the wife of
her master to whom she bore several children,
Tobra included. Tobra was our cook during our
first term on the field and one evening he came
and wished to be excused from work the next
morning as he wished to go and meet his brother
who was coming from a distance. We did not

<span class="hr"> </span>

trouble ourselves to inquire into the matter as
there seems no end to the brothers and sisters
these people have anyway, but the next day at
noon he returned so excited and nearly beside
himself that we became interested and asked what
it meant. Then we learned that the brother who
had come was the little boy who had escaped
when his mother was captured away down in the
other section of the country. He had not been
able to learn anything from her since she was
carried off by the war boys. Years passed and
he was grown to manhood when one day a man
from our part happened to be passing through
and he incidentally learned that his mother was
still living and settled at Kunso. He lost little
time in coming, though the journey was a long
one, and at last, this mother and son so long lost
to each other, were reunited. What a glad time
it was! We did not wonder at Tobra's excitement 
when we learned of the new brother he had
found whom he had never seen before.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">This cook of ours earned enough by working at
the mission to redeem himself from slavery and
several members of his family beside. Funkali,
one of our faithful workmen also redeemed himself. 
In fact a large part of our mission family
have once been slaves.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Pa Bokari was stolen when a child and sold
into slavery. He worked for his master till grown
to young manhood when Dennis Kinney, one of
the mission boys, helped him to get away, took

<span class="hr"> </span>

him to the coast, and presented his case to an
English official. The verdict given was that since
he was stolen and sold he should have his freedom 
without ransom and Pa Bokari came back
up country made free by the highest authority of
the land, and began work at our mission station.
Listening morning and evening to the "God
Word" as it was preached, he soon became a
Christian and then he said his heart began to
trouble him about running away from his master
and giving him nothing in return. He felt that
the man who stole him was the one who was
seriously in the wrong and not the man who
bought him as there was no law against the
buying of slaves at that time. Reasoning thus
he felt it to be his duty to pay back to the master 
the "honest money" that he had paid for him,
and working at ten shillings a month, or about
$2.50 in United States money, and his board, he
soon managed to save the amount which was four
pounds and went and paid it every cent. There
is a later item concerning this case which I never
knew till Pa Bokari told me it the second time
on the field. He said that he received the money
all back, or as much rather, as he had paid to the
master. He had secured an English official and
some friends to go with him far across the country 
to the town where lived the man who had
stolen him and the fellow was so badly frightened
that he quickly procured and paid over the four
pounds and thus the case was all straightened up.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Carrie Bossworth when a mere child was being

<span class="hr"> </span>

sold as a slave contrary to the laws that had
recently been passed, when she was discovered
by some of the Alliance missionaries hidden under 
an old work bench. The proceedings immediately 
came to a stand still, Carrie was left in
the hands of the white people and afterwards
given to them by the District Commissioner as a
mission girl. When the health of some of the
Alliance missionaries failed and they were obliged
to come home Carrie was given over to the Kunso
mission. She was always a sweet pretty child
and developed into a beautiful young woman. As
she was now of marriageable age and most desirable 
as a wife because of her training she had
received from the white people, a man of some
wealth and power tried to claim her as his
daughter but failed to bring any satisfactory proof
and was utterly defeated in his purpose to take
her from us.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Ward McDowell, now one of our older mission
boys, was sold by his relatives after the law had
been passed against it. He was only a small
child at the time and his owners were taking him
away with them when they stopped in the town
of Kunso to rest awhile and Ward heard of the
missionaries and their kindness to slaves. They
passed on several towns farther and there while
his master was sleeping, Ward slipped away and
started in all haste back toward Kunso. On arriving 
at the station he went around and looked in at
the back door of the school room fearing to enter

<span class="hr"> </span>

lest he should drop dead in the presence of the
white people. Soon one of the mission boys spied
him and went out and cheered his broken spirit,
calmed his fears, and later presented him to the
missionaries who received him kindly, gave him
some clothes to wear, and permitted him to stay
with them. The master never ventured to come
for him for the crime would be found out and
probably cost him more in the end than the price
of his lost slave.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Bali, who was our cook during my second term
at Kunso, was once a slave. Our first knowledge
of him was when he came with some other men
to help dig a well on the mission farm. He was
only a stripling then, but when the well became
so deep that the others were afraid to continue
the work Bali would fearlessly go down and keep
digging away. We all began to feel an interest
in the boy and set about helping him to obtain
his freedom. I shall never forget the night when
the last farthing was paid to his master and he
came to the mission with beaming face to tell us
about it and let us rejoice with him. Since that
time he has found a greater redemption that
brings added light to his dusky countenance and
such gladness to his heart that he never wearies
of telling the blessed story to his lost countrymen.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Yabi was a girl whom Miss Barts redeemed
from slavery. She was owned by a woman who
lived some distance away but had been turned
over to a relative of hers who lived at Kunso,

<span class="hr"> </span>

called Pa Lenseni. The girl came often to visit
us and aroused our pity. She was tall and slender 
in form, her left hand and arm were badly
crippled, and she had no clothes to wear. This
was certainly bad enough but we felt that the
moral influence of the home in which she lived
was yet worse, and Miss Barts soon formed the
purpose of redeeming her. A great outcry was
heard in the town one day and we learned that
Yabi was the one who was crying from a severe
flogging and pounding which she had to take from
a young man, a brother of her master, whose insults 
she had resented. This treatment of the
poor girl spurred Miss Barts on to a hasty settlement 
of the case and the man was called to talk
the "palavar" and receive the money. He was
very angry to think of losing one of his best
slaves and went back to town breathing out
threatenings and declaring that he would not let
her go, His friends gathered about him and advised 
him to accept the price and say no more
about it for if he did not the matter would probably 
go to the English District Commissioner and
then Yabi would be granted her freedom and he
left with nothing in return. He finally became
somewhat pacified and came to the mission that
same evening and received the money in the
presence of Pa Bokari, the Santika and Kopra
of our town, and others. Yabi slept at the mission 
that night and soon found her place among
the pupils in the school. All the other girls

<span class="hr"> </span>

seemed to like her and took a real interest in
her; especially Carrie who said she must learn to
pray and set about teaching her. One night a few
weeks afterward, when we were showing the
magic lantern pictures of the life of Christ and
Yabi saw him dying on the cross for her sins and
the sins of the whole world, she was much overcome 
and going over to Miss Barts she fell down
upon her knees weeping and saying, "O I never
knew that He suffered so for me!" Jesus really
seemed to come into this young girl's heart and
we rejoiced in another soul won from heathenism 
to serve the living God. Eugene, one of
the young men in our school, decided that he
wanted Yabi for his wife but feared to speak to
her about it lest he be rejected. Finally he
gained courage enough to mention the subject to
Miss Barts and one day when they two were all
alone in her room she told Yabi. The dear girl
considered the matter thoughtfully and answered
that she loved Eugene, and then wanted to pray
over it. Kneeling by the bedside near Miss
Barts, she reverently thanked God for the love of
this good young man and sought His direction
and blessing upon both their lives. American
girls may well pattern after this poor heathen
slave girl in seeking God's guidance in these
serious matters. If all would do it there would
be far happier homes in this land of ours and
the divorce courts be obliged to go out of business. 
In course of time Eugene and Yabi were

<span class="hr"> </span>

happily married with a Christian ceremony and
are now the main helpers at the new mission station 
in the Limba country.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">And now we have come to the saddest part of
our story—that of death and burial. Sad because
it is the hopeless ending of a sad and bitter life.
It is beyond the power of my pen to picture these
scenes in half their awfulness.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Before the life spark has left the body of a
dying person the natives begin their wailing
which is pathetic in the extreme and enough to
strike a chill to the strongest heart. Since listening 
to the wail of the African women we think
we can better understand the words of Scripture
where they speak of "weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">On account of the intense heat of that climate
the interment takes place on the same day or the
day following the death. Relatives and friends
gather in to mourn with the bereaved family and
at the coming of each new group the wailing begins 
afresh. Sometimes the mourners walk about
wringing their hands or throw themselves down
despairingly and pour out their great grief in
moaning and lamentation.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The graves are often dug in the floor of the
house or porch where the person has lived, if not
there then in the yard or garden, and occasionally
just outside the town by the roadside. The
bodies are wrapped in white cloth and well enfolded 
in native mats and the earth is always

<span class="hr"> </span>

well trodden down and packed hard for the
graves are not more than three feet deep and
they wish to prevent the wild animals of the
bush from digging them up and devouring them.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The first heathen burial I ever witnessed was
of an old woman in the town of Kunso. It was
during the first of my experience on the field.
Another lady missionary was with us and wrote
an article about it for publication. It can best be
described in her own words, as follows:</p>
         <p class="tei_p">"Yesterday we learned that one of the old
women in Kunso was dying. We went as soon
as we could but she was dead when we arrived.
The wailing smote our ears before we left the
mission. On going into the hut we found the
dead woman lying on a mat at one side of the
room, while her three daughters sat by her side
wailing and wringing their hands. We tried to
speak a few words of comfort but they seemed
not to hear us. We left the scene with saddened
hearts and as we slowly returned to the mission
spoke of the great contrast between the death of
a Christian and that of a heathen. To-day at
two o'clock the burial took place and was conducted 
by the women's secret society called the
"Bondu." Mrs. Boardman and I went and saw
for the first time a native buried. As we neared
the grave we saw the remains, wrapped in white
cloth, on a mat, lying by the side of the grave
which was just long and wide enough for the
body and not more than two and one-half feet

<span class="hr"> </span>

deep; and until they were ready to lower the
remains it was covered with banana leaves. We
stood and waited in the shade of a native house
while the preparations were being made by two
almost entirely naked women, one of them the
oldest daughter of the dead woman; the other the
leader of the "Bondu" who had charge of the
burial. They prepared themselves for the work
by drinking water and eating kola nuts (the latter 
a strong stimulant) and tying a narrow strip
of white cloth around their heads. Then they
began arranging the corpse by tying a white
"gbassa" (bandana) around the head, and putting
in the hand a piece of tobacco, of which in life
she was very fond. They put a piece of tobacco
in their mouths and then went down into the
grave and placed a mat over the bottom; still
remaining in the grave, they raised the body by
grasping the edges of the mat on which it lay,
and amidst the heathen dirge which was chanted
by nearly all, lowered it to its last resting place.
Those standing about then bade the dead goodby; 
turned their backs to the grave and tossed
pebbles over their shoulders. The two in the
grave then put a mat over the dead, tucking it
down carefully, after which they stood on the
body and began to rake in the clods with their
hands, and while they did so walked back and
forth over the body to pack the earth down
solidly. Frequently while they were filling the
grave they leaped out and danced around with

<span class="hr"> </span>

the other women who were marching in single
file singing and beating drums while some who
were looking on laughed brutally and talked
loudly. After the grave was filled and rounded,
the daughter took the hoe which had belonged
to her mother, and made a number of ineffectual
attempts to break the handle. Men and women
seeing her failure broke into loud laughing; finally
another woman came to her assistance and pounding 
it on a stone, at last broke it and threw it
down. The daughter picked it up, threw it on
the grave, and ended the ceremony by dancing
fiendishly for a time, then walked rapidly away
in the direction of her house. The other two
daughters who had stood quietly by, now returned 
to the house that had been their mother's
and at once began to wail, with the tears streaming 
down their cheeks, while they sobbed out
again and again in the Loko language a requiem,
which sounded as near as I can remember like
the following, "Owe o wany wa! Owe o wany
wa!" It would be impossible to describe the
dismal way in which it was uttered. The entire
scene was very sad, and as I gazed I thought,
"This is what man is without God."</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The foregoing is an account of the saddest
burial I ever witnessed in Kunso for things are
becoming much changed there now. The Bondu
society always have charge of the burial of the
women but are quieter and less heathenish about
it, and nearly always send for some of the 

<span class="hr"> </span>

missionaries to come and pray over the grave. It is
not the custom for a man to attend the funeral
of a woman or a woman that of a man but now
the white women are beginning to be admitted
to the Christian burial service. When our dear
old Ya Baki Limba died a messenger was immediately 
dspatched to us but the distance being
great and the day Sunday when our hammock
men were resting, we were unable to go, so sent
two of our Christian young men. Under other
circumstances they would not have been received
at a woman's funeral but because they were from
the white missionaries a warm welcome was given
them and they were permitted to pray over the
grave and speak forth the message we had sent
for that occasion.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The natives have a shocking way of disposing
of the body of the first child to die in a family.
They throw it out upon the rubbish heap and
slightly cover it with earth or leaves. Henry and
Mary Johnston, two of our faithful native helpers,
met with their first loss while I was last on the
field, when little Emma, their second child went
to be with Jesus, and passed through a severe
struggle in trying to avoid such a burial of their
beloved child. They had taken the little one,
during its sickness, to Mary's mother's home, and
when death seemed near that couple walked in
the middle of the night, to Masumbo, a distance
of six or seven miles, and begged that word be
sent to Mr. Smith at once telling him to go for

<span class="hr"> </span>

the body and conduct a Christian burial service.
The messenger from Masumbo came as speedily
as possible reaching us early on Sunday morning. 
Mr. Smith started right away for the town
where the sick child was and when the wailing
women saw him they broke out in loud crying
and said, "O he is coming for the corpse, he is
coming for the corpse!" But death had not come
yet and after a good talk with Henry and Mary
he returned to the mission whither they soon
followed bringing their sick little girl and accompanied 
by the mourning relatives. All that human
love could do was done for little Emma. Through
all that night some of the missionaries sat with
the anxious parents. There was little sleep for
any of us. Toward morning they thought she
was dying and the grandmother ran to town
screaming and crying and brought an excited
crowd of people back with her. All day Monday
the people came as it is their custom to do and
sat around the unconscious child. We all realized
that she would not be with us much longer and
the grief of the stricken parents was pathetic in
the extreme. The tears lay very shallow in all
our eyes that day as we looked at Mary and
heard her say when they brought her older child
and gave him into her arms, "O my children, my
treasures! My children, my treasures!" Then
looking into little Emma's face she would plead,
"O my child you cannot see me, you cannot hear
my voice, you do not know me any more!" The

<span class="hr"> </span>

situation was indeed a trying one but made much
harder by the friends coming and urging Henry
to go to town and engage in the heathen ceremonies 
that were customary on such occasions
and suggesting that in this way the life might
yet be saved. Henry's older brother brought the
chief of the town up with a demand that the
child should be taken there. We knew that they
wished only to practice over her their country
customs and give it the usual burial in the rubbish 
heap. When Henry refused they told him
his child's blood would be upon his own head
and went away. Poor Henry and Mary! how
they needed our help and sympathy at this most
trying time. They stood the test bravely and
God sustained them. That night at about eleven
o'clock Emma's spirit took its flight. Mary was
already weak from lack of food and loss of sleep
but she stood over the lifeless form weeping as
though her very heart were bursting, while Henry
went about almost beside himself with grief. We
went out and chose a place in our little ground
and set men to digging the grave, then returning
to the house Mr. Smith set about making the
casket, padding it and covering it with thick white
cloth within and without; while we women
searched out from our small store some dainty
white goods and a few yards of lace and made a
beautiful shroud. All night long we worked while
others gave such comfort as they could to the
sorrowing parents and watched the remains lest

<span class="hr"> </span>

it be stolen away and buried according to the
native custom. At four o'clock in the morning
some of us women laid down to rest a little but
we could not sleep much for a woman came and
sat directly under our window wailing and crying.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The funeral took place at eight o'clock in our
chapel before a large assembly of people. Some
of the older school boys were clad neatly in white
"rumas" and acted as bearers. Fresh roses had
been gathered and were tied into pretty bouquets
for the adorning of the little white casket. 
Appropriate hymns were sung and the breaking
hearts of the parents were comforted with words
from God's own Book. Tenderly the little form
was borne away to the grave yard where they
committed earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust co
dust, and she was buried forever from our sight.
Since then a little boy has come to fill the place
that Emma left vacant in her fond parent's hearts
but he tarried only a few months. The missionaries 
now on the field write us that they made his
grave by the side of his little sister. These 
Christian parents now have two treasures in heaven.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Thus the Christian burial service is gradually
coming into heathen Africa, and a hope brighter
than they have ever known before coming into
bereaved hearts. God pity those who are still
without a ray of light to illumine their darkness
and sorrow. How long must they wait? "How
long, O Lord, how long!"</p>
