      <p class="tei_p">My Dear Sir</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have just received a letter from 
Mr. G. W. S. Hall, of Balt. in which he 
says, "I have several times been told that 
Mr. Taylor was born in Balt. His relatives 
reside here, &amp; several are personally known to me. 
When I last saw him he had not given 
up his allegiance, and I have not heard 
of his doing so since."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Yours most resply
