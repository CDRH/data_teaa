      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">REPORT</p>  

      <p class="tei_p">Consular Bureau<br/>
May 15th, 1875.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The oath must, in my opinion, 
be taken. The Act of July 2, 
1862 (12 Stats. 502) prescribes the 
"iron clad" oath to be taken by 
every person elected or appointed 
to any office of honor or 
profit in the civil, military 
or naval service. That oath 
has been and is now required 
from Consuls who are not in 
the class of persons named in 
the Act of July 11, 1868 (15 Stats 85) 
whose legal disabilities have 
been removed. These oaths 
are prescribed by the Revised 
Statutes sections 1756 and 1757.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The oath must be taken 
before the appointee can enter 
upon the duties of his office 
or be entitled to any part 
of the salary or other envolvements.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">A. B. Wood.</p>
