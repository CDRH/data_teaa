the Liberians; in commemoration
of the decisive battle,
and victory of the Liberians,
over the aboriginal <del>inhabitants</del> and
native tribes of Cape
Montsurrado; the present
site of Monrovia,
on December 1, 1822;
while firing the National
salute, December 1, 1898,
from guns situated on
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the summit of Montsurrado,
the concussion of the guns
caused the east gable
of Trinity Chapel, Protestant
Episcopal Mission, situated,
at the base of the mountains,
to fall in; greatly demolishing
the Altar, reading
stand, organ, chandelier
and other furniture! Fortunately,
no person was in
the building, at the time,
as the National ceremonies;
the President, cabinet officers,
and Foreign Representatives,
were, at the time, being
conducted in the
Methodist Episcopal
Church.</p>

honor to be your
obedient servant;<br/>
