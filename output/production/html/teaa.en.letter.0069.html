      <p class="tei_p">United States Commercial Agency<br/>
St Paul de Loanda 25th November 1865.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In my despatch No 13, I had the honor of informing the 
Department that an American Seaman calling himself Edward
Baxter, presented himself to me, on the 24th of September, requesting
protection as a destitute seaman. He represented to me that he
departed from the American Barque "Governor Carver" <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Captain[?]</span>
Charles Mason of Westport, R.I. at Mossamedes (Little Fish Bay)
for the reason that said Barque had taken in at that place slaves
and that he assisted taking on board the first seventy five and on
returning for more, ran away and after the Barque had proceeded to
sea, he came down to the town and made arrangements with Captain
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> of the British Mail Steamer "Lincolnshire" and came to
this place and presented himself to me, as stated. I listened to 
his

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">Hon William H Seward<br/>
Secretary of State<br/>
Washington,
D.C.</span>



his story with apprehension and doubt, but not wishing to show, that 
I entertained such a feeling, I treated the subject, for a time with
seeming indifference, and set Baxter to work, about my house
with some light jobs. My anxiety to sift out the truth of this case
increased from day to day and I questioned and cross-questioned
him frequently on the subject with a view to compare one statement
with another and I was surprised to find them always correspond.
On one of these days, I met at the house of a friend, Watson
Vredenburg Esquire, H B M's Commissioner for the Slave trade. 
We conversed together and I promised to send Baxter to him,
that he might take his deposition, with an object to compare with
the one that I should require of him, when I should consider it 
proper to take a formal one, before me. I sent Baxter to Mr
Vredenburg, and to my surprise, two days after, I learned at
a late hour that Baxter had been sent on board the British 
Brig "Elizabeth," as a British subject, and which vessel was that
day sail for England. I was still under excitement on account
of this extraordinary occurrence. Captain <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>
of

<span class="hr"> </span>

of the Portuguese Corvette "Infante D. João" came into
my office, and in a few words I explained to him the course of
my <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>. He made a remark of dissatisfaction and said
he could not imagine what motive could have caused Mr Vredenburg
to act so, and doubted very much if Baxter had been properly 
cleared by the Police Authorities, according to the local laws of 
this Province. I <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> that same evening to learn that through 
Commander de <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">O's[?]</span> influence Baxter was taken out of the  
vessel by order of the Police Authorities for not having been 
cleared from that department and sent on board of the Portuguese
Corvette "Infante D. João." Two days afterwards Baxter 
was sent to the British Consul (Mr Vredenburg is also Consul) 
on the 9th ult. I addressed a note to Mr Vredenburg, who
immediately sent Baxter to my office with a despatch and a 
certified copy of the deposition of Baxter, taken before him. In
the mean time the Portuguese Government had heard of the report
made by Baxter of an embarcation of slaves in a Portuguese 
port, and addressed me a note requesting me the kindness to 
inform

<span class="hr"> </span>

inform them fully on the subject. The following evening, I 
invited three witnesses to my house and before them, took the 
deposition of Baxter and the same day sent a despatch 
to the Colonial Secretary General <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">&amp;[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">other[?]</span> certified copies of both 
depositions. I also addressed Mr Vredenburg again. You will 
observe by inclosure No 6 that I requested of the Provincial Government
to send Baxter to Mossamedes, as I thought that on the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">very[?]</span> 
         <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">spot[?]</span>
they would be better able to get at the truth of this <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> subject.
I received a reply in the affirmative and on the 12th ult. I sent
Baxter with a despatch, on board of the Portuguese Corvette
"Infante D. João". On the 14th ulto I received a despatch from 
the British Consul. On the 30th ulto the Corvette returned, and 
on that day I received a communication from Commander de <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">O[?]</span>
and on the 3rd inst a despatch from the acting Governor General 
both informing me that the evidence obtained at Mossamedes found
Baxter guilty of basest falsehood and that he had been committed
to Prison by order of the Government, to be tried on 
the charge of the false <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>. I replied on the 3rd inst 
requesting

<span class="hr"> </span>

requesting copies of the depositions taken at Mossamedes. In 
the meantime Baxter was brought up before the Judicial 
Authorities for indictment, when he confessed, voluntarily that 
everything he had said was false and a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> mention of his <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>
I was officially informed of this fact on the 9th inst, enclosing
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> a certified copy of the confession taken before the Chief 
Justice of the City in open court. His Excellency in reply to my 
despatch (enclosure No 18) regretted that the original deposition 
taken at Mossamedes had been sent to the Judicial Authorities
to enable them to find a bill of indictment against Baxter 
which prevented him sending me copies at present, adding
that they were very voluminous and not of much importance 
after the declaration of falsehood made by him. I was satisfied 
that the evidence was quite sufficient and on the 11th inst. I 
addressed a note to the President of the Government Council
expressing my approval in complimentary terms on the favorable 
termination of this case, which at one time indicated serious
alarm, on the probable revival of the slave trade in American
vessels

<span class="hr"> </span>

vessels and in Portuguese waters. On the 20th inst I addressed 
a note of congratulations  and thanks to Commander <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Viagas de O.[?]</span>
of the Portuguese Corvette Infante de João and also to Fernando 
da Costa Leal Governor of Mossamedes. I also wrote on the same 
date to Charles Mason, Master of the Barque "Governor Carver"
requesting him when he visited Mossamedes to call at this port.
Throughout the case a spirited correspondence has been carried on 
between the British Consul and the President of the Government 
Council, on account of the Authorities having taken Baxter 
from on board the Brig "Elizabeth" and question their authority 
to do so, alleging that they interfered with his Consular functions. 
The Government has endeavoured to convince him that they acted in 
accordance with the local laws of this Province. The President 
of the Government Council told me, he had censured him for 
not regarding in a more serious manner the responsibility 
which the accusation of Baxter inflicted upon the reputation of 
Portugal and the United States and without entertaining the 
least consideration would have sent Baxter to the Foreign 
Office

<span class="hr"> </span>

Office in England and thereby compromise this Provincial 
Government and the Commercial Agency of the United States.
The Provincial Government has also been informed by the 
British Consul, that Baxter was a British subject and 
professes to have delivered him over to me as a deserter from an 
American Barque. The Department will observe by the
several depositions, that Baxter declared himself, on oath, 
to be an American naturalized citizen. In his confession 
which can be taken as a "bona fide" evidence, he further 
declares that he is a naturalized citizen of the United States. 
He claimed protection at this Commercial Agency, when he 
could have applied to the British Consulate and being also 
a deserter from the American Barque "Governor Carver". I felt 
fully authorized with all these facts to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">use[?]</span> upon him my 
Consular authority. By enclosure No 1 you will perceive that 
I expressed my surprise to the British Consul at his attempting 
to send Baxter to England, when he had no reason to
suppose that I had done with him. Baxter was commanded 
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to present himself to the Foreign Office, on his arrival on  
England, to be there questioned on the subject and the 
consequences of such a step, without the possibility of contra-evidence, 
would have been extremely serious. He offered me 
an apology for acting thus, alleging that he supposed I 
had done with him, but which I had never thought a 
justifiable excuse; Nevertheless I considered it proper to 
let the subject stop with him, after this apology.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">You will perceive by the numerous enclosures 
that I have enclosed to do this <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> upon me 
and throughout the proceedings have been anxious to discover if
the abominable traffic of slave trade had been revived, in
American vessels which, since the capital punishment of 
Captain Gordon by the United States Government, I have 
not heard of a single shipment of slaves, from this part of the 
Coast and which previous to that event was almost exclusively
carried on, most disgracefully, under the American Flag. 
I learn from the President of the Government Council that 
Baxter's



Baxter's trial will soon take place. I was surprised to hear 
him say that the penalty applicable to him by the Criminal 
laws of Portugal is very slight, and very probably he will only 
receive a reprimand and be set at liberty. Should this take place 
I shall order him back to Prison, and keep him there four 
months for desertion, unless claimed in the meantime by 
the Master of the Barque "Governor Carver". I never met 
in all my life a more curt and consummate rouge than the 
said Edward Baxter. A man so regardless of himself and 
his Creator as to make several false <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> only to injure
Captain Mason of the "Governor Carver", who he himself 
has wronged by receiving advance money at St Helena  
and in a few days afterwards deserted at Mossamedes.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would do an act of injustice if I closed this 
despatch without mentioning in an honorable manner, the 
able, prompt and willing cooperation, I received from the 
Government in assisting me to penetrate the truth of Baxter's 
representation, and it is worthy of commendable honor to the 
Authorities



Authorities here to note the indignation which the story of 
Baxter aroused within them, when their National honor was 
in danger of being stigmatized with the revival of the slave 
trade in their waters.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I, Edward Baxter, a native of Liverpool, 
twenty-five years of age, do solemnly declare, and 
state as follows—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Towards the end of July, I shipped 
at St Helena, on board the Barque "Governor 
Carver" belonging to Westport, United States of 
America, of which vessel, Charles Mason, a 
native of Nantucket, is master. The first port
at which the ship touched, after leaving St Helena, 
was Little Fish Bay, the arrival there on a 
Friday afternoon about three weeks ago. At about 
twelve Oclock that night, four boats, in one of 
which I was employed, were sent ashore to the 
North Point of the Bay, and there embarked seventy 
five Blacks, whom they conveyed on board. The boats 
were then sent a second time to the same place, 
and as I was afraid of what they were doing, I 
ran away in the dark, as I shipped to go 
on



on a whaling voyage, and not to run slaves; I 
cannot say what number of Blacks, they took the 
second time. The ship was fitted out like a 
whaler, but when we were three days out from 
St Helena, I saw Sperm whales, all round the ship 
and said to the second Mate "how is it we are not
lowering after those whales." "Oh", said he, "we are 
not after these kind of whales." I then asked him 
what kind of whales we were after; he answered 
"We are after two or three hundred Black birds if 
we can catch them." Then the fourth day they lifted 
out the bodies. The Americans call them "Tripods",
and there was a kind of Bulk head. They knocked 
the bulkhead away and I saw an iron rod,
nailed down to the deck, with footcuffs, a sort of
handcuffs worn on the feet. Then the Captain
said Boatswain do you know what these things 
are for? "this is where we shall put the first 
seventy

<span class="hr"> </span>

seventy niggers we get." and it was there they put 
the seventy-five they brought on board that Friday
night. After leaving the boat, I remained all 
night in the mountains, the Barque went away 
the following morning, steering towards the north.
I then went down into the town, and saw the Captain 
of the steamer "Lincolnshire" whom I asked to 
give me a passage to Loanda; He told me to 
help to get the Bullocks on board, and then 
to go on board myself; I did so, and arrived 
at this port on the 24th of September.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This Honorable Consul of Government

to leave this city. The said seaman states that 
he deserted from an American Barque that had 
taken in a cargo of slaves at Mossamedes, and 
that he, unwilling to run such a risk, ran
away in that place and obtained a passage to

      <p class="tei_p">I, Edward Baxter; a native of
Liverpool, employed in the commerce of the United
States during the past five years, as an American
Seaman; do solemnly declare and state 
as follows;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">About three years ago I left
Boston, Mass. United States of America, on
board the American Ship "Eliza and Nell" bound
for San Franchisco; Arrived there and shipped
on board the American Ship "<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Live Yankees[?]</span>"
bound for Hong Kong and for <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>. On
arrival there re entered said ship bound
back to San Franshisco. and on said
passage was captured by the Confederate
Privateer "Alabama"; was landed by said
privateer at Bahia where I shipped on
board the American Barque "<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> bound
for



for San Franchisco at which port I
shipped on board the American Ship "Flying
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>" to Shanghai then from said port
on board said vessel bound for New
York; Touched at the Island of St 
Helena, where on account of a previous
disagreement with the Captain, I got my
discharge; How I shipped on board the
American Barque "Governor Carver" of
Westport, Rhode Island, United States of
America, where of Charles Mason was
Master, and bound on a whaling cruise
for which purpose I shipped as Boatswain
and Boatsteerer. Three days after leaving
St Helena, I saw several whales round the
ship, and inquired of the Second Mate "Why
dont we <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">lower[?]</span> after these whales?" He replied
we arnt after these kind of Whales"
I

         <span class="hr"> </span>

About 9 days out from St Helena, stood
off and on, off Little Fish bay for three
days; Second day of said three days, went
on shore with two boats, about two miles
north of Fort in said bay; Obtained about
40 barrels water, towed them off. Fourth
day after sighting Little Fish bay and
thirteenth from St Helena, entered and dropped
anchor in said bay, about two ship's lengths
from said Fort. when the Capitan went
on shore. Two Custom House Officers
came on board but seeing no cargo on
board, left at about 9 Oclock. Lay till
about 11 Oclock; when the boats returned,
having the Captain ashore. Weighed
anchor under command of First Mate and
dropped it again in about half an hour
after sailing that time in a northerly
direction

<span class="hr"> </span>

direction, which brought us off the North
point of the bay. Lowered four boats and
proceeded on shore, a little to the northward
of said north point; I was on board the
first boat which struck the shore commandded
by the second Mate, where we met
the Captain and other five Portuguese,
having in their possession, Seventy-five
Negro Slaves, which we shipped on board
said boats, and from thence to said American
Barque "Governor Carver". Captain
still on shore. said slaves' arms were
secured behind them by means of grass
ropes. On reaching the vessel the Tripots
were removed and Bulkheads knocked
away, and slaves were then unshackled
to said bars, on doing which, grass ropes
were removed. The four boats again
returned

<span class="hr"> </span>

returned to the shore; I being as before
in second Mates' boat; Reached the
shore where we again met the Captain and
said companions; I saw a number of black
men, but as to their being slaves, I cannot
swear. Jumped out of the boat, my reason
for which was demanded by the Mate.
My reply was to answer a call of Nature
and taking advantage of this excuse, I
ran away and hid in the hills, till
daybreak, when I ascended one of said
hills and saw said American Barque "Governor
Carver" getting under way; I saw her
stand apparently to the northward under
a good breeze, and about 9 oclock, she
was nearly out of sight to the northward.
Same day British Mail Steamer "Lincolnshire"
arrived from Lisbon. About 12 oclock started
for

<span class="hr"> </span>

for the town of Mossamedes; Little Fish
bay, and there met on the beach Captain
James of the said Steamer "Lincolnshire" from
whom I asked a passage to Loanda
where I could secure the protection of an
American Consul there being none in
Mossamedes; He requested me to assist
his men to ship some bullocks and
then to go on board myself, which I
did on same day. Do no remember
whether it was same evening or next that
the Steamer sailed for Loanda. During
the disembarcation of said seventy five
slaves, one of the Boatsteerers remarked
that if procurable two hundred and fifty
slaves would be shipped. Arrived at
Loanda September 24th. immediately after
which I landed and presented myself 
to

<span class="hr"> </span>

to the United States Commercial Agents
who on hearing my statement, gave
me protection, and during the interval
from said date, till the 5th inst; was 
from day to day <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> examined
by him regarding preceeding statement
and on one occasion was sent to the
British Commissioner of the Slave
Trade in this City for examination;
I did not claim from him British
protection, but in answer to a question
of where I was born, I said I was
by birth a native of Liverpool, England
but that for several years I had been
sailing under the American Flag, as
an American sailor, and have had
protection papers, last of which was
procured at New London, State of Connecticut
United

<span class="hr"> </span>

United States of America, five years ago.
The British Commissioner who is also British
Consul, then said, You are then an Englishman
and as such, I shall ship you on board
of the English Brig "Elizabeth" then in
this port and sailing on the 4th inst. and
into which vessel I was accordingly shipped,
but previous to which, he gave me a
despatch, which on arrival in England, I
was to deliver to the Foreign Office in
London and they would look after me.
Owing to now compliance with some of the
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> regulations, I was taken from on
board said Brig "Elizabeth" by the
Portuguese authorities.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I still declare myself to
be an American Citizen and as such
ask American protection.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

the British Consul &amp; the other before me 
by which it will be seen that the honor of 
Portugal as well as the United States is brought

      <p class="tei_p">I most respectfully request of the 
Provincial Government to use all endeavors 
to search out the truth of this important 
case, that not only the honor of Portugal but
also that of the United States may be indicated;
I therefore propose that said 
seaman be sent to Mossamedes, as I think, 
on the spot, the Provincial Government, will 
have a better opportunity to judge the true merits 
of the case &amp; better qualify me to bring to 
the notice of the United States Government <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">a[?]</span>

his representation. I felt apprehension of his
veracity &amp; therefore adopted a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">mood[?]</span> of indifference
towards him &amp; employed him with some light work
about my house.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">From day to day I would question
&amp; cross question him closely about the circumstances
connected with the Barque "Governor Carver" with a
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span> to compare one statement with another. It was
also with this intention I sent him to you as
"Commissioner of the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">mixed[?]</span> Commission" that you
also might extract from him information to compare
afterwards with that he furnished me.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I must confess: I was
somewhat surprised when I learned at a late
hour that you had shipped him as a British
subject on board of the British Brig "Elizabeth",
&amp; I am glad to note in your despatch of yesterday
that your action was unintentional, although I
gave



gave you no cause whatever for you to suppose I
had done with him. My mind was relieved of
a great responsibility when it came to my knowledge
that for some slight error of Police regulation
Baxter was taken out of the Brig Elizabeth by
the Portuguese Authorities before she went to sea.
You also much be well aware that such a grave
subject as the charge made against the American
Barque "Governor Carver"; my Government
will look to me for explanations.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Last evening in the presence
of important witnesses, I took the deposition of said
Edward Baxter on the charge prepared by him
against the character of the Barque "Governor Carver"
I enclose you a copy which will prove to you the
grounds which justify me in handing said Baxter
over to the Provincial Government for them, at my
request to thoroughly investigate this important
case

purpose of ascertaining the truth of a statement made by 
him of a shipment of slaves having been effected on the

      <p class="tei_p">Said Edward Baxter whereby contradicts 
his statements in various instances and proves from his

his statement. The fact that becomes evident is 
that

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">United States Commercial Agent.<br/>

that whether from not agreeing with the Captain
of the Barque "Governor Carver" or because he may 
have been punished for his misconduct and deserted 
the vessel, remaining some days in the neighborhood 
of the town, eating and sleeping in different houses, 
whose owners he afterwards pointed out as being 
in conspiracy with the Captain of the vessel at the 
time of shipping the slaves and to whom he had 
said that it was easier to cut his throat, than to
return on board the ship he had deserted, for the 
reason that he was on very bad terms with the Captain,
and it was only after the vessel had sailed that he 
went to the town where he slept one night.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Whether in revenge to the Captain or from 
any other bad feeling, the said Edward Baxter 
has made a fake statement involving not only 
the authorities, but also several individuals some of

been pointed out by him as having assisted the 
Captain in shipping the slaves as he had

made by the Judge and to me the answers given by 
him, which he promised to fulfill. Thus  
through the said interpreter, the Judge inquired 
of the prisoner, his name, place of birth, age, 
name of father, condition in life, profession,
last situation, if he had ever before been in 
prison, and if he enjoys the liberty of his occupation;
to which, he replied that his name 
was Edward Baxter, Native of Liverpool, age 
25 years, a son of John and Mary Baxter, 
married,

married, a seaman, and that he enjoys the 
liberty of his profession, that his last residence 
was at Mossamedes from where he came to this
city, having remained there only a short time, and
that he had never been in prison before. Being
further questioned by the judge as to his nationality 
he answered that he was an American Citizen, 
having been naturalized as such about nine years 
ago; He, the said prisoner then addressing the 
interpreter said that the accusation made by him 
both to the American and British Consuls and 
to the Government of this Province, of a shipment 
of slaves made in the Bay of Mossamedes on board

false and that he declared it to be such to the

the base accusation of having the slave trade revived
at your very door more especially at a 
time when it had become a fixed fact that for
many years no instance of this nefarious nature 
has been recorded but on the contrary, your 
district has flourished by increased Commercial

also expressed to them my thanks for this cordial

      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the 24th of September, Edward Baxter, styling 
himself an American Seaman, presented himself to this 
Commercial Agency for protection, and on oath, before 
witnesses, declared that, he ran away from your vessel 
at Little Fish Bay, for the reason that you had 
shipped, at that place, a cargo of slaves. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">This report, very naturally created 
much excitement and anxiety with the Local Portuguese 
Authorities and myself, who proceeded, at once to investigate 
the truth. Baxter was examined by the 
Authorities of this place and by the British Consul 
also, and at my request was sent to Little Fish Bay 
on board of the Portuguese Corvette "Infante D. João,"
which

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">Captain Charles Mason<br/>
of the<br/>
American Barque "Governor Carver" </span>



which vessel left here October 12th and returned on the 
30th of the same month, on which day, I received a 
communication from the Commander, informing me 
that Baxter failed to prove, on the alleged <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">[?]</span>, the 
accusation he had made against your vessel and the 
inhabitants of that industrious village. Baxter was 
then, by order of the Portuguese Government, imprisoned.
A few days after he was brought before the Judicial 
Tribunal of this City and indicted with the charge
of having made false accusation and ordered, again, 
to prison, to await his trial. Baxter, before the
court, became alarmed and to a Portuguese gentleman 
he confessed that everything he had said was false 
and a pure invention of his own. He was brought 
again before the Judge and made a formal confession, 
of which I have the honor to enclose a copy. Baxter 
is still in Prison, waiting his trial. The acting 
Governor General told me, a few days ago, that 
the

<span class="hr"> </span>

the penalty of his crime, by the criminal laws of 
Portugal was very light and that he would only be 
reprimanded and set at Liberty. As soon as 
this takes place, I shall order Baxter back to 
Prison and there confine him four months, on the 
charge of having deserted your vessel and I hope, 
in the meantime, you will come to Loanda to 
claim him. Your presence here will also do 
much good. I have been requested by the Governor 
General of this Province to invite you to 
visit this Port.</p>
