      <p class="tei_p">Gaboon W. Africa Dec. 20 1861</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hon. W. H. Seward<br/>
Washington.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your communication of July 
3rd, and Circular of August 28th with
the form of the Oath of Allegiance 
have been received. The duties of 
the Agency in Gaboon have not been 
onerous. In consequence of the Presidents
Proclamation of July, I think, 
relating to Citizens of the United 
States returning to the States,
I gave a certificate of citizenship
to Miss Jane A. Van Allen, who 
sailed from this port Nov 1st in the Brig 
'Ocean Eagle', Phillip D. Yates Master,
bound to New York. As this is 
a free port, &amp; neither my duties as 
a Missionary permitting, or the interests
of humanity requiring, I did not 
perform any official duties toward 
the vessel. I also am in doubt whether 
your letter of July 3d authorizing 
any such official acts.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">But it is now my painful duty 
to inform you of the death of 
Capt. R. E. Lawlin of New York,
Agent for James Bishop &amp; Co. of 
No. 3 Beaver Street New York.
Captain Lawlin was a trader of 
thirty years standing on this Coast.
He died at Camma, about 150
miles South of the Gaboon. His 
principal business was at that 
place. He had no responsible 
person about him. I have sent 
the best man I could find, to go 
&amp; take charge of the property until
I can find the means of 
bringing it to this place. I have 
written to the U.S. Sloop Saratoga,
&amp; the French Commodore, Baron 
Didelot has offered any 
assistance in his power. But I shall 
not be able to give you particular 
information before
the departure of this month's 
mail. I have no means of 
estimating the amount of property 
left in Camma. It is in the 
midst of a barbarous people. </p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">21st. I have just returned from 
paying a visit to the Commodore. He 
told me at once that he had read 
a communication (the enclosed) which I had 
the honor to address to him on the 
18th Inst., at his request for a written
statement of the Case of Capt Lawlin.
The proposed at once to send a steamer 
to protect the property, in case 
the natives made any resistance 
to its removal.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In regard to the Oath of Allegiance 
he said there was no one here authorized
to administer the oath, but he 
would direct the Commandant on
shore to witness my signature to 
it. This I will attend to at my earliest
convenience. The Commodore 
assured me that the simple request 
as an American citizen, for assistance 
to secure the property of an 
American citizen was all he required.
I have engaged an English Barque 
to go &amp; bring the goods to this place.
I have written very fully to Messrs
James Bishop &amp; Co, &amp; have requested 

<span class="hr"> </span>

them to despatch an Agent immediately 
to take charge of this business. 
I shall try &amp; keep within the law 
in my business transactions, &amp;
must beg your indulgence for 
any informalities in my communications.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would simply add that, after
considerable inquiry, I suppose 
the amount of African produce 
&amp; goods in the factory at Camma
must be between $10,000 
&amp; $15,000. Ten thousand, &amp; fifteen
thousand dollars. My associate 
in Missionary labor, Rev. J. M. 
Preston, will go to Camma in
the vessel to attend to the shipping 
of the goods &amp; settling up Capt.
Lawlins business there. He is a 
perfectly reliable man. It seems
to be impossible for me to go.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, Sir,<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/> 
Wm Walker</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Memorial<br/>
To Baron Didelot<br/>
Commandant Superior in Gaboon.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Capt. R. E. Lawlin, a citizen
of the United States of America
and trading at Camma as the 
Agent of James Bishop &amp; Co. of
New York, died the 6th Inst.
at Camma. The enclosed will
give you all the information we
have received as to his last
sickness and death. We feel
much concern for the property
left by Captain Lawlin, in the
care of only the Spaniard who
wrote a letter, or which the enclosed
is a copy (translation). We
have despatched a colored man
to Camma to look after the goods
until a vessel can be procured 
to bring them away. But we fear
trouble  from the natives when we
attempt to remove the property.
Our wish is to bring all to Gaboon
for safe keeping until

<span class="hr"> </span>

advices can be received from New
York. We are deeply sensible of
your kindness in offering to order
a vessel to call at Camma, and
render aid in settling this affair.
But we have not at hand any sufficient 
means of bringing the factory
here, though a vessel is daily
expected, which we hope to engage
to go on this business. The factory
is 18 miles from the mouth of the 
Ferrian Vaz River, but it is only
3 miles from the sea-shore. But
the intervening space between
the factory and sea-shore is, at
this season, very wet. A letter
from yourself when <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> King
Rotimbo, when we have the means
of bringing the goods to Gaboon,
may perhaps answer our purpose.
When a vessel is found I will inform
you immediately.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The U.S. Sloop Saratoga is probably 
South, in the vicinity of 
the Congo. Should your vessel
fall in with her, will you be

<span class="hr"> </span>

so obliging as to ask the Commander
to deliver the enclosed to the Commander
of the Saratoga?</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I remain Sir<br/>
Your very obedient servant<br/>
Wm Walker.</p>



      <p class="tei_p">Gaboon Dec. 18. 1861.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">To the Commander of the 'Saratoga'<br/>
Gaboon Dec. 18. 1861.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have but a moment to write
by a French man-of-war, '<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">Decheiche[?]</span>',
going South, to inform you of the 
death of Capt. R. E. Lawlin of Camma.
The French Commodore, Baron Didelot, 
has kindly offered to order the vessel 
which carries this letter, to stop and 
communicate with the factory and 
people. But it would detain her
one or two days, and we have no 
vessel to go and get the cargo. So I 
have not thought it worth while to 
trouble him. I presume though, 
when we get ready to settle the business,
he will be willing to render 
any needed assistance.</p>

      <span class="hr"> </span>

      <p class="tei_p">It is a sad case that Capt. Lawlin
should die there alone. Can you not 
make it in your way to go there 
immediately and protect the property?
I received a letter from his merchants
by last mail, &amp; they spoke of the
possibility of this same event. I shall
engage at the earliest moment a vessel 
to go and take off the goods, and 
bring them to Gaboon. But we fear 
difficulty with the natives. I shall 
write you via Fernando Po.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In the mean time,<br/>
I remain<br/>
Very Truly Yours<br/>
Wm. Walker<br/>
Acting U.S. Vice Commercial Agent.</p>
