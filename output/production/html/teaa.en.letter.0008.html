      <p class="tei_p">Sir.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Some months since I had the
honor to receive from the State Department a leave of
absence from my post at St Paul de Loanda, West Coast
of Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It was then my intention to resign on my arrival
in the States, but circumstances have since occurred by
which I intend to return. I now very respectfully
request your Honor to allow that liberty to extend till
next March, for the reason that I do not wish to arrive
on the Coast till after the months of March April &amp; May, 
as those months are considered the worst part of the year
on the S W Coast of Africa</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I trust my past services &amp; attention to the duties
previous to the time of a Salary being affixed, have entitled
me to retain the Office for another term &amp; that my request 
may be granted.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is my intention to visit Washington
previous to my departure as I have some important subjects
to lay before the Department.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Any communication you may have to call my
attention, please address me at No 158 Pearl St New York
City.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Very Respectfully<br/>
Your Obt Servt<br/>
John G. Willis<br/>
U.S. Coml Agent at St Paul de Loanda</p>
