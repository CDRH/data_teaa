      <p class="tei_p">Office of the Consul-General of the Republic of Liberia,<br/>
Room 27, Bible-House.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">New York, March 17, 1863</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable Wm. H. Seward<br/>
Secretary of State</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir,</p>
 
      <p class="tei_p">The daily
papers of this city announced a few days since that
there had been an exchange of the ratified Treaty with
Liberia through our Minister at London.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I would like to publish the Treaty in the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">forthcoming[?]</span>
number of the New York Colonization Journal and write
ask for a copy of it for that purpose. Will you oblige
me by directing a copy to me if it is in print?</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I see steady development of the military organization
of the freed slaves &amp; conclude that until the rebellion is 
conquered it will not be a part of the Government policy
to encourage emigration anywhere.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am Very Respectfully Yours<br/>
J. B. Pinney</p>
