      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor respectfully to inform
you that, as stated in my No 2 despatch,
Dr. J. Henry Roberts was designated by
me to examine Jas. R. Newby, the pension
claimant. He consented to do so, but
subsequently declined, stating as his reason
for such declination, that the stipulated
fee $5.00 was not sufficient. In consequence
of his failure I designated
A. L. Wykham, M.D. who proceeded to
perform the designed examination, as per
inclosure 3.</p>

Your obedient servant<br/>

Department of the United States Government,
I hereby designate you to

necessary information appertaining to

      <p class="tei_p">Permit me to state that Mr. J. H.
Roberts, M.D. (on account of his
seniority) was first designated to
perform the examination, but owing
to the smallness of the fee, $5, he
declines to do so.</p>
