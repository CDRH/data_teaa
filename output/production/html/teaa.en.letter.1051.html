Assistant Sec. of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor
to call your attention to my despatch
No 5, dated June 30th 1887, and to the
enclosure of said despatch No 5
in reference to contingent expenses
for 2nd quarter, in said reports
returned the Postage acc't at $12.16.
The Postmaster was in the country at
the time, and upon his return, I am
informed that instead of the legation
(U.S.) owing $12.16 the am't should be
$15.58/100. I write this as an explanation.

<span class="hr"> </span>

Please find enclosed the voucher
from Postmaster for said am't, which
I have this day paid, by draft on the 
Hon. Sec. of State for said am't and
charged the same to the contingent allowance
for the 2nd quarter. I hope that
from now on, the business of this
legation may be conducted in such
a way as to gain the approval
of the Department with great
consideration &amp;c., I am your ob't servant</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Chas. H. J. Taylor<br/>
U.S. Consul General</p>
      <p class="tei_p">P.S. It must be remembered, that Mr S. S.
Sevier, setted all the expenses of the second
quarter, saving the "Postage bill," and is therefore
responsible. The making of the report, of course,
devolved on me.</p>
