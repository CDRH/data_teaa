      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of yours of the 28 inst making the
enquiry if "Mr R Cunningham is authorised to draw
Drafts on "your" Department to the compensation provided
for the Agency &amp;c", to which I have to reply
in the affirmative.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have now to respectfully
request you to inform me whether I have been superseded
in the office of US Coml Agent at St Paul d
Loanda. My reasons for which I trust you will
excuse, as during the month of January last I received
a Letter from Mr S A Andrews of Albion, Orange
Co New York, stating he had been appointed U.S.
Coml Agent in my stead. After some correspondence
he offered to resign the office on certain conditions to
part of which I complied. I now learn from him that
he misunderstood my purpose &amp; that he intends going 
to Africa.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Several months since I was in Washington 
&amp; handed a Letter to Hon Chas. Sumner, who informed
me

<span class="tei_fw_type_address tei_fw">F. W. Seward Esq<br/>
Assistant Secretary State Department<br/>
Washington D.C.</span>
         <span class="hr">Â </span>

me he would give it his attention, which led me to presume,
that as I had always to the best of my knowledge given satisfaction 
to the several Administrations during the time I 
held the office, that as it was a place where I was well &amp; favorably
known that I would still sustain it.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">As the only notice I have received of my Removal comes 
from Mr Andrews, will you please inform me if the same is 
correct.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Your Obt Servt<br/>
John G. Willis.</p>
