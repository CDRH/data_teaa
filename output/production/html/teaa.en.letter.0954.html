abandoned, that the "Log" of the "Genl Sedgwick" may be of interest to the Meteorological Beaureau of the Government: And I may state that if desired, Captain Miller would be willing to furnish a copy of the "Log" mentioned. I enclose also, a despatch addressed to the Department by J. E. Jackson Esquire, United States Consul at St. Paul de Loando, who was a passenger in the "Genl. Sedgwick" at the time the Crew of the "John Parker" were rescued.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">J. A. M. Miller, Master of the "Genl. Sedgwick" merchant vessel belonging to the port of Boston. U.S., and of the burden of six hundred and twenty two and ninety one hundredths (622 90/100) tons, per register, do solemnly and sincerely declare that I received on board the said vessel at Latitude thirty eight degrees and thirty minutes (38° 30') and Longitude fifty three degrees and forty minutes (53° 40'), the under mentioned twenty two seamen and passengers; being part and I believe the whole of the crew and persons of and on

<span class="hr"> </span>

on board of the "John Parker," (full rigged ship, abandoned because in sinking condition) merchant vessel, which I have heard and verily believe was on her voyage from St. Johns, New Brunswick, to Liverpool of the burthen of about one thousand three hundred (1,300) tons, and was owned by Vaughn and Company of St. Johns New Brunswick.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I further declare that I landed them on the German Barque "Elsie" three (3) of the said men, and on the Ship "Squando" of St. Johns New Brunswick 

<span class="hr"> </span>

         <del>(18)</del> Nineteen (19) men, and they landed on the said vessels respectively on the twenty fourth day of October 1877 as set forth in the statement underneath, and subsisted them the number of days against each person expressed, making in the whole nine days; and that during the whole of such time I had my full complement of men and boys, viz: nine men exclusive of the under-mentioned seamen, for whom I now claim subsistence; and in proof of the justice of the claim I am willing (if required) to produce my

<span class="hr"> </span>

my log-book, and the declaration of the mate and carpenter; and I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to be true. I further declare that not any provisions were saved from the wrecked vessel.</p>
