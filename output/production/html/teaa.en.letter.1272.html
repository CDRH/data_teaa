Legation of the United States,<br/>
Monrovia Liberia,<br/>
Aug. 3, 1899.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
say, that the recent and
constant racial troubles
in the United States,
are having the effect to
greatly alienate the African
(Liberian) trade from them.
The principal Liberian
merchants are formerly
American citizens, and
since the frequent outbursts 
of racial disturbances,
in the United States,
they are seeking a closer
business alliance with
European merchants. It
is now, with difficulty,
and very seldom at
that, that I have the
opportunity of certifying
to

<span class="hr">Â </span>

to a declared Invoice, of
Liberian productions to a
port, in the United States.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
your obedient servant,<br/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<br/>
M. R. and C. General.<br/>
To<br/>
Hon. David J. Hill,<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington.</p>
