      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have to request of
the Department instructions
in relation to the Article in
the English and German
treaties stipulating that 
goods may be landed here
in bond, for a period not 
exceeding six months.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">This question is liable
to arise at any time
and I should be glad to know just what rights
might

<span class="hr"> </span>

might be claimed by Americans 
under this article.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The clause in the
new treaties relating to the 
duty of twenty-five per cent
in spirituous liquors, is practically
a dead-letter, from
the fact that France has
not assented to the application
of the Revised Tariff
of Zanzibar to the Exports
of France entering this
country.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Naturally, the English 
and German merchants objected
to paying any higher
duty on spirituous liquors
than was being paid by
the French i.e. five per cent
and

<span class="hr"> </span>

and the new rate (25%) 
consequently could not be 
sustained.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Sultan doubtless
having in mind the fact
that this new rate was intended
in part as a compensation 
for a reduction
of the duty in certain articles 
of the Export is not
inclined to allow the foreign
merchants any privileges under the new
treaties.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is well known that
the Sultan does not look
with favor on the idea of
landing goods in bond
and he might possibly
object

<span class="hr"> </span>

object on the grounds mentioned 
above.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It is often a great
convenience — as well as a
saving of Expense — to Americans
engaged in business
here to land goods in
bond since in that way
a vessel might proceed
direct to her destination
without stopping at an
intermediate port.</p>
