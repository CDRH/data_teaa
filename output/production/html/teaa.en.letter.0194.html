      <p class="tei_p">Edward J. Roye President of Liberia<br/>
To<br/>
His Excellency U S. Grant<br/>
President of the United States</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Executive Mansion<br/>
Monrovia<br/>
31st March 1871</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Great and Good Friend</p>

      <p class="tei_p">You will please pardon
my intrusion upon your time and patience
I hope however you will consider the nature
and importance of the subject which I wish
to present for your consideration a sufficient apology.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My

<span class="hr"> </span>

My principal reason in writing you at this
time is to present to you, as briefly as the
as the nature and importance of the subject
will admit the present condition of the Republic
of Liberia, and what she needs and must have
at the crisis, to enable her government to become 
established upon a permanent basis, and to allow
her to fully develope her almost inexhaustible
resources.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We have a country containing between
six and seven hundred miles along the sea coast
and extending far back into the interior. The
civilized portion of the population is small only
comprising about twenty or twenty five thousand. 
Of native Africans we have about 
five hundred thousand within the limits
of the Republic, many of whom have made
more or less progress towards civilization

<span class="hr"> </span>

The history of this Colony must be familiar
to every intelligent Americans. Its rise progress 
and present state are well known
to the statesmen of all countries.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For nearly fifty years, we have
been struggling to establish a free government
and to build up Republican Institutions, in
the land of our forefathers. How far we
have been successful, we must leave the
civilized world to judge. We have done
all that we could with the limited means
at our command to accomplish the great
object of our mission here.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The first emmigrants
arrived on these shores comparatively poor

<span class="hr"> </span>

and ignorant having been born and
reared amid the institutions of slavery
where they had but few opportunities
for mental improvement and for 
the accumulation of wealth</p>

      <p class="tei_p">These colonies were
originally established under the auspices
of the American Colonization Society.
Since then they have been united under
one Government called "The Republic
of Liberia"</p>

      <p class="tei_p">But our Government
is, like all other new governments
poor and is therefore unable without aid

<span class="hr"> </span>

from other sources to progress as rapidly
as the interests of the people and the progress
of the age require.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">This government even with
its hands tied by the want of adequate
means and heavily oppressed by poverty
has still done much to commend itself
favorably to the consideration of the civilized 
world. It has done that which for 
many years baffled the united efforts of
America and England; viz: it has 
demolished the slave factories on the land
and broken up the slave trade on the
sea-coast, within the jurisdiction of
this Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It may be deemed <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
in me to add that Liberia possesses 
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">vast[?]</span>

         <span class="hr"> </span>

and almost unlimited resources. if
her government and people only had
the means necessary to fully develope
them. Her valleys and hills, forests and
fields abound with the choicest products
of the earth. Our forests are filled with
the most valuable timber, dyewoods, and
gums. We possess a soil of unsurpassed
fertility suitable for the growth of everything
that will thrive written the tropics.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">All we need is the necessary means to
open roads, build bridges &amp;c, that ere
may be enabled to cultivate and improve
our lands and bring our products to
market. To establish a system of
internal improvement; and facilitate our
progress in agriculture, we need labor
saving

<span class="hr"> </span>

saving machines. For the moral and 
mental improvement of the Americo Liberians
and also the native tribes around us, we
need money. Without money the resources
of Liberia cannot be developed, our vast
illimitable fields cannot be cultivated,
and without this material aid schools and
churches cannot be established among
the native population. Unless we can get
money the wheels of government must be
stopped or move on with very slow progress.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In order then that we may rise rapidly
from our infant state towards national 
manhood, and to enable us to keep pace
with the progress of the age, to prevent the
great experiment of founding a government 
of colored men on the soil of Africa,
from

<span class="hr"> </span>

from proving to be a disgraceful failure,
we are compelled to solicit pecuniary
aid from the friends of human progress
and few institutions wherever they may 
be found.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">While it is true that Africa
is our fatherland; yet we regard America
as our mother country and we sincerely
believe that her government and people
feel an interest in our welfare, and the
success of our undertaking.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">For this reason we make our appeal
to the government and people of the
United States, or through such other persons
as you may deem proper, to negotiate a
loan of five hundred thousand dollars
in coin

<span class="hr"> </span>

in coin <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_several tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
of the Principal and Interest <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_several tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span>
we will give Government Bonds and
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_several tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> of the Republic. I
am authorized by an Act of the Legislature
to borrow between three and five 
hundred dollars. A Copy of the Act is
herewith enclosed. Any statistics that
you may wish to see concerning the
present Revenue of Liberia, I will be
pleased to furnish you at any time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Should we be enabled to effects this
loan, we desire that the cost of the 
munitions of war with the Interest thereon
and the amount due for the "Rescue" 
including the cost of sending her out, shall
be deducted from the amount loaned.
Our

<span class="hr"> </span>

Our Chargè d'Affaires is fully authorised
to negotiate with the United States Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">From the very pleasant and agreeable 
interview that I had with you
during my recent visit to the United 
States, I am strongly induced to believe
that you will feel so great an interest
in the rapid progress of the only 
Republican Government of colored men on the
West Coast of Africa, that you will do
everything in your power to secure this
loan for the benefit of Liberia - and
thus cause it to be recorded upon the
page of impartial history, another
substantial proof of the fact:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the great Republic of the

<span class="hr"> </span>

United States is a true friend of the
Negro Race</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is my duty to inform your
Excellency that James E. Moore Esqr has
so acted against the government that he
is objectionably holding the Office of
U.S. Vice-Minister Resident near this Government.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">With feelings of the most profound
respect.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I remain<br/>
Yours truly, E. J. Roye</p>

      <p class="tei_p">P.S. <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_series tei_unclear_extent_of tei_unclear_extent_symbols tei_unclear">[?]</span> will do as
well as any other kind of <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_series tei_unclear_extent_of tei_unclear_extent_symbols tei_unclear">[?]</span>.</p>
