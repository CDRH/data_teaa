      <p class="tei_p">Sir</p>

      <p class="tei_p">On the 20th ultimo the 
Portuguese War Steamer Mendello 
arrived here from Lisbon with 
authority from Her Portuguese 
Majesty's Government to the 
Governor General of this Province 
to recognize me as Commercial 
Agent of the United States, 
which authority has been 
published in the official 
"Baletim" of this city.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Commerce of this 
Province is still prostrated from 
the effects of the late epidemic 
of Small Pox. Transportation 
to

to and from this interior has 
not as yet been resumed, causing
serious inconvenience to 
business in general. The market 
is overstocked with imported merchandise 
particularly of Dry
Goods, creating serious apprehensions
to holders of them fearing 
a decline in the cotton market 
by a sudden cessation of hostilities
in the United States.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Notwithstanding business 
in this Province has been very 
dull. the Pea Nut crop between 
Ambriz and Congo River 
has been very large amounting 
to over Two thousand tons, double 
the amount of last year's yield
should



should it continue to increase 
in a like proportion from year 
to year which I think will be 
the case. in a very short time 
it will exceed the Pea Nut crop
of Sierra Leone and Gambia 
River. They are obtained here 
shelled.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Portuguese vessels who 
trade here for the articles of 
produce not obtainable now
have been very fortunate to 
find charters for their vessels
to freight Pea Nuts to 
Europe.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Five years ago only 
about four hundred tons were
raised on this part of the
coast



coast and found purchases only 
for the United States' market</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor<br/>
to be<br/>
Your Most Obed't Servt<br/>
Augustus Archer Silva<br/>
Commercial Agent</p>
