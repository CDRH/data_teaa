which has had my careful attention,
and I have the honor to report that
Saltpond is about the centre of the
Gold Coast under English Protectorate,
and Mr George E. Eminsang, the
United States Consular Agent residing

<span class="hr"> </span>

residing at Elmina, is a native African
but has become a Naturalized subject

anyway partial to the interest of American
Citizens at his post, this Consulate
is not aware of the fact.</p>

be decided by the Department consulting
