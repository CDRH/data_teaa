         <h3>Important Dates in the Development of the Congo State.</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="body">

         <p class="tei_p">The founding of the Congo State resulted from the opening of Central Africa through the explorations of Mr. Henry M. Stanley. An association was quickly formed, under the leadership of King Leopold of Belgium, for further exploration, with a view to occupation of the country. The association, having received recognition by the Powers, became the Congo State.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Mr. Stanley arrives at the mouth of the Congo, completing his journey across Africa, August 12, 1877.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Comité d'Etudes du Haut-Congo, formed by King Leopold for study of conditions in the Congo territory, November 20, 1878.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Stanley revisits central Africa, under the auspices of the Comité, August, 1879, to June, 1882; December, 1882, to January, 1884.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The Comité becomes International Association of the Congo, January, 1883.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The Association promises to France a reversionary interest in its territories, April 23, 1884.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">International Association recognized by Germany, November 8, 1884.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">International Conference of fourteen Powers convenes at Berlin for consideration of problems in Congo territory, November 15, 1884, to January 26, 1885.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">International Association recognized by Great Britain, December 16, 1884; by Italy, December 19, 1884; by Austro-Hungary, December 24, 1884; by other Powers, December 27, 1884, to February 23, 1885.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The king bequeaths to Belgium the succession to his interests in the Congo State, August 2, 1889.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">International Conference convenes at Brussels to devise measures for suppression of slave trade, November 22, 1889, to July 2, 1890.<br/>
At this Conference the Congo State seeks and gains permission for imposition of import duties.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The Societies composing the conference appear in the case not primarily as complainants, but as transmitters of testimony received by them which their moral responsibility requires them to make known (1).</p>

         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">They present a dreadful catalogue of alleged wrongs, involving accusation of excessive cruelties, massacres, mutilations, cannibalism, and the threatened extermination of tribes and depopulation of large territories.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">They imply not exceptional instances of inhumanity but its prevalence throughout the vast rubber district, as the result of the system maintained by the State.</p>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">Compare report of Governor General of the Congo State in recent issue of Officiel Bulletin: "Certain officers have complained of the arrogant attitude the native population assumes when it has been subjected to certain influences. Once cannot escape the fact that this situation reveals itself in the neighborhood of certain * * * missionary posts. * * * I have already called the attention of the Government to this grave situation and to the measures it is likely to entail if it continues. Already our local officers have found it necessary to act in order to safeguard the authority of the State, and if it is necessary the Governor General will consider the advisability of making use of the means that the decree of September 15, 1889, puts at his disposal in the case of strangers who use their influence over the natives against the State."</span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">Compare letter of Rev. Mr. Harris, written at Baringa, July 2, 1904,—printed in London <em class="hi">News</em>:</span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">8 Mr. E. J. Glave, having been associated with Mr. Stanley in the earlier days in Africa, revisited the Congo after an absence of six years. His record of his experiences as he made his way over the route followed previously with Mr. Stanley is given in articles "New Conditions in Central Africa," in the <em class="hi">Century Magazine,</em> volumes 53, 54. At first he is perplexed and incredulous. Successive entries in his journal show the growth of his deep indignation and abhorrence. For citations, see Memorial to Congress, pages 7 and 9, and pamphlet "Treatment of Women and Children in the Congo State," pp. 3, 5-10.</span>

         </span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">"Mr. Casement has never forgotten, in the course of his report, that he was a machine sent to record in a spirit of calm judicial impartiality the sights he witnessed, and he preformed his task with marvelous self-restraint."</span>

         <p class="tei_p">Counter-testimony explained in part as relating to other than the rubber districts (11) as due to admiration for public works from which the native derives no advantage (12) or as former earlier testimony afterward repudiated (13).</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The later judgment of Mr. Stanley (14).</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Testimony favorable to the Congo State should receive recognition in the impartial investigation asked. It does not constitute a reason for refusing investigation.</p>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">11 Compare Sir Harry Johnston, quoted as a defender of the king: "My own reports on the administration of the Congo Free State referred only to a small portion of the northeastern zone." See, also, statement of Mr. Grenfell and other members of "Natives' Protection Commission," in White Book, Africa, page 21, No. 10—that "it was only possible for them to act within the very narrow scope of their personal experience in the lower country, far removed from the immense rubber districts."</span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">12 Compare expression in editorial in <em class="hi">N. Y. Times</em>, October 1, 1904:</span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">"We have examined with some care the statement of the Belgian Minister to this country in the current number of the <em class="hi">North American Review</em> with reference to "Conditions in the Congo Free State." If the article was intended as a refutation in advance of the memorial that will be laid before the President by Mr. Morel, the honorary Secretary of the Congo Reform Association, we fear that it will prove inadequate. It can be admitted without hesitation that the commercial progress of the Congo State is all that Baron Moncheur represents it, without meeting the charges of cruelty and greed that are brought against the Belgian officials in the Congo State. These charges have been brought forward by the Congo Reform Association in detail and with evidence of much apparent force."</span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">Compare statement of Mr. Casement as to native hospital and Government works at Leopoldville: "The native hospital is an unseemly place. I found seventeen sleeping-sickness patients, male and female, lying about in the utmost dirt * * * one (a woman) had fallen into the fire just prior to my arrival. She had been well bandaged, but was still lying out on the ground, with her head almost in the fire. * * * All were very near their end, and two days later I found one of them lying dead out in the open. * * * In somewhat striking contrast, * * * I found within a couple of hundreds of yards the Government workshop for repairing and fitting the steamers. Here all was brightness, care, order, and activity, and it was impossible not to admire and commend the industry which created and maintained this useful establishment."—<em class="hi">For full statement, see page 74, Memorial to Congress.</em>
         </span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">13 Compare Sir Harry Johnston: "In the Itura District I saw nothing to take exception to, but the report of Consul Casement, whom I know to be a competent, trustworthy, and absolutely impartial official of great experience in various parts of Africa, convinces me that the charges of maladministration of native affairs in the north and central parts of the Congo Free State are only two well founded."</span>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">14 "The last year of his (Stanley's) life was certainly embittered by the growing conviction that he had been the indirect means of placing in the Congo basin a power more unscrupulous and disastrous in its result than might have grown up under the flag of Islam."—<em class="hi">Sir Harry Johnstone, an intimate friend of Mr. Stanley, in "Good Words," August, 1904.</em>

         <span class="tei_fw_type_note tei_fw">"As soon as any district had been brought under the control of the whites, and the natives had been rendered tractable, the soldiery was immediately recruited from the latter, and was almost always sent away to distant tribes, which it could be used to subjugate and control. This last policy is the keynote of the whole system. Leopold governs one African tribe with soldiers recruited from another. Many a State post has been manned by less than half a dozen white men with hundreds of these black soldiers in the midst of hostile population. It is a most extraordinary phenomenon.

The Congo State shows (1889-1902) imports of $17,500,000; exports, $37,000,000. Of this importation 70 per cent. represents supplies for Government, stores for the railway, arms, and ammunition. During the four years cited exports in the Congo State have increased by 40 per cent.; imports diminished by 25 per cent. "These figures alone show wherein the policy of King Leopold, as applied in the Congo, differs from that of every civilized administration.

         <p class="tei_p">If so extreme a claim, involving complete extinction of native rights, were tolerable in respect of sovereign Powers in general, when assuming administration over a dependent people in a newly-opened territory, it would appear to be voided in this instance by the limitation upon sovereignty involved in the engagements made by the Congo State with the Powers (32).

         <p class="tei_p">Like the earlier Conference, the Conference at Brussels defined requirements imposed upon and accepted by the Powers administering government in the designated territory, and received from them an engagement to fulfill these requirements (54).

         <p class="tei_p">54 "The work of civilization, as you call it, is an enormous and continual butchery."—<em class="hi">M. Lorand.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">55 "Think what these soldiers are—cannibals, belonging to other tribes than those over whom they are set. Think that this <em class="hi">Force Publique</em> is commanded by non-commissioned officers intoxicated with self-importance, free or practically so from all control. How can anyone dare to maintain that such a regime must not fatally, inevitably, lead to innumerable atrocities."—<em class="hi">M. Vandervelde.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">56 "The practice of cutting off hands * * * is said to be contrary to instructions; but you are content to say that the indulgence must be shown, and that this bad habit must be corrected 'little by little,' and you plead, moreover, that only the hands of fallen enemies are cut off, and that if hands are cut off enemies not quite dead, and who, after recovery, have had the bad taste to come to the missionaries and show them their stumps, it was due to an original mistake in thinking that they were dead."—<em class="hi">M. Lorand.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">57 "'Can you forbid a young soldier, anxious to exhibit proofs of his bravery, bringing back war-trophies' * * What I contend is, that if the practice of cutting off hands still continues, it must be not be forgotten that those who practice it are blacks, yesterday barbarous, still semi-barbarous—and that it is only by degrees that the custom can be eradicated."—<em class="hi">M. Woeste.</em> "And it is those very blacks who compose the <em class="hi">Force Publique</em> of the Congo State."—<em class="hi">M. Vandervelde.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">58 "All the facts we brought forward in this Chamber were denied at first most energetically; but later, little by little, they were proved by documents and by official texts. Now they are admitted, but it is said they are isolated incidents."—<em class="hi">M. Lorand.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">59 "M. Woeste tells us that abominable crimes are also committed in Belgium. Perhaps the Minister of Justice will tell us if abominable crimes are often committed in Belgium by officials, by agents of the Administration,—if we often meet in this country with officers, officials and magistrates who are torturers, assassins and incendiaries, and who <em class="hi">take hostages.</em>"—<em class="hi">M. Lorand.</em>

         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">60 "They (the natives) are not entitled to anything: what is given to them is a pure gratuity."—<em class="hi">M. de Smet de Neeyer</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">"You went there with the pretense of saving the natives from the slave trade and barbarism—with the pretense of initiating them into the advantages of civilization, and you take their forests, you forbid them to hunt and to collect produce, you drive them to military service and forced labor. They did not call you to Africa, they did not want you. And today a Belgian minister says that they are entitled to nothing."—<em class="hi">M. Lorand.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">61 "As an exploiting enterprise, it may be admitted that the State has been successful. The successes secured for the benefit of one person and that person's immediate entourage have been at the price of the enslavement of millions of men handed over to merciless exploitation and to horrors which are the inevitable accompaniment of such a system. A Domaine Prive of the extent of that of the Congo State the world has never known. Never has a private property been created of such a vast size, eighty-one times the size of Belgium, worked like a farm, but, like one of the tropical farms of the planters of long ago, where free labor does not exist, and where the population is organized into vast droves of slaves."—<em class="hi">M. Lorand.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">62 "I am told 'collectivism (in Belgium) is appropriation by the State,' but what is 'the State' in Belgium? It is the representative of the people. What is 'the State' in the Congo? It is the representative of one individuality."—<em class="hi">M. Vandervelde.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">63 "You tell me that no one draws personal profits. * * * You assert that he (the king) personally spends nothing out of the personal revenues which he draws from the Congo. Where is the proof of the statement? Where are the revenue and expenditure returns."—<em class="hi">M. Vandervelde.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">64 "M. Vandervelde concluded with an eloquent appeal that the Belgian Government should approach the Congo State with a view to a thorough searching inquiry.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">"M. de Favereau expressed surprise that 'a member of the Belgian Parliament should seek to force us into a breach of the principle (that no government possesses the right to interfere in the administration of another State) and ask us to mix ourselves up in the affairs of a <em class="hi">foreign State.</em>'"</p>

         <p class="tei_p">65 "It is inadvisable that in one part of an oration it should be declared that the Congo State government is a foreign government, of whom we may not ask explanations; and that in another part of the same oration, we should be told that the Congo is so closely identified with Belgium that to criticize the former is to attack the latter."—<em class="hi">M. Vandervelde.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">66 "All Belgians should have the patriotism to hold their tongues at the right moment."—<em class="hi">M. Huysmans, Belgian Minister and Member of Council of Congo State.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">67 "In all parliaments men who denounce abuses are true patriots."—<em class="hi">M. Janson.</em>

            <span class="bold">Promise and Performance.</span>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">68 "The Congo nation abounds in produce of various kinds. Thanks to trade, all this produce will enter into circulation; <em class="hi">the counterpart of its value will return to Africa,</em> for which it will prove a source of prosperity."—<em class="hi">Mr. Stanley, representing International Association in Manchester, Eng., October 1, 1884.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">69 "The European traders on the Congo are unanimous in their desire that the present condition of things shall not be disturbed by which <em class="hi">all

<span class="hr"> </span>

can freely enter into commercial negotiations with the natives.</em> Full satisfaction to this desire is given by the Association; absolute freedom of trade is insured with the advantage of a civilized Power to assist them in case of necessity."—<em class="hi">Manifesto of International Association, 1884.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">70 "We traveled through and through the Congo lands preparing the natives for the near advent of a bright and happy future, showing to them the nature of the produce that <em class="hi">would be marketable</em> when the white man should come; and everywhere accepted as their friends and benefactors."—<em class="hi">Mr. Stanley, representing Association in London, 1884.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">71 "How can liberty of commerce remain either for the European or the native when the Congo State has declared that the elements which constitute that commerce <em class="hi">are its property</em>."—"Leopold's Rule in Africa," p. 84.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">72 "When 99% of the territory is monopolized and exploited like a farm either by the Congo State or by companies to which the State has made concessions, there can be no longer in practice any freedom of trade, and there can only be in practice the enslavement of the unfortunate inhabitants of the territory."—"Leopold's Rule in Africa," p. 328.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">73 "Individuals," it asserts, "can trade on the Congo freely but only '<em class="hi">in what is legitimate</em>,' the truth being, of course, that the only two articles such individuals could by any possibility trade in at all are rubber and ivory, and trade in these articles is, of course, illegitimate, because rubber and ivory <em class="hi">in the Congo territories</em> are the properties of the State."—"Leopold's Rule in Africa," p. 85.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">74 "The immediate effect of the policy of monopolization was the elimination of trade; the resultant effect was the enslavement of the population."—"Leopold's Rule in Africa," p. 76.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">75 "I beg to bring to your notice that from January 1, 1899, it is necessary that 4000 kilos of India rubber shall be furnished every month. To insure this result, I give you carte blanche."—<em class="hi">Written instructions of Commandant Verstraten, District Commissioner in the Congo State, to his subordinates.</em>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">76 "In theory the natives have some sort of right to these villages and plantations; in practice their village grounds are no more theirs than any of the grounds of that vast country, and the produce from their plantations belongs to the State. The evidence in Consul Casement's report is overwhelmingly conclusive on this point."—"Leopold's Rule in Africa," p. 81.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">77 "If you deprive the native of his land and the fruits thereof by virtue of a piece of paper signed in Europe, you make him a slave in his own land."—"Leopold's Rule in Africa."</p>

         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">78 "We, the undersigned, chiefs of the district of N'Kamo and of all the districts extending from the River Congo to Leopoldville, have resolved to put ourselves under the protection and patronage of the Comité d'Etudes du Haut Congo, in order to prevent strangers animated by wicked intentions, or ignorant of our customs, from embarrassing or endangering the peace, security and independence which we now enjoy."</p>

         <p class="tei_p">For a remarkable presentation of conditions in the Congo State the reader is referred to the volume now issued by the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co., New York, "King Leopold's Rule in Africa," by Edmund D. Morel. Of this book the New York <em class="hi">Evening Post</em> says: "The mass of evidence the author has accumulated is simply appalling in its implications. Only a part of it, when brought out in a debate in the House of Commons, was enough to cause the adoption of a resolution that the fearful abuses in the Congo Free State ought to be inquired into by the civilized nations. To promote and make effective such an inquiry is the great aim of this book. It is a perfect arsenal of weapons against the exploiters and enslavers and torturers and murderers of the natives along the Congo."</p>
