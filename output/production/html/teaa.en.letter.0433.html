December 12th 1873</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is my painful duty to inform 
you that the late Wm Hogan Esq, United 
States Consul for this place died in England 
last month. I cannot give you the exact 
date, the particulars not having as yet come 
to hand.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr Hogan left this on August 13th
last, since which time I have had the 
honor of representing him, I having been 
gazetted by our Colonial Government, at 
his request, as Acting United States Consul.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">Expecting his return before this, I 
have simply followed his instructions with 
regard to the American vessels, which have 
arrived at, and departed from this place 
Keeping all accounts for his inspection, 
previous to his forwarding them to you.</p> 

      <p class="tei_p">I shall consider myself honored 
by receiving instructions, as to my future proceedings

proceedings, at the same time I shall be 
only too happy to continue my Consular 
duties as before.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">There being no resident American 
Merchant here, I am in hopes that you 
will think fit to allow me to do so, in 
which case, I will at all time do my 
interest to protect the interests of those 
I shall represent, and the experience I 
have gained during a twenty years stay 
on the Coast will greatly assist me 
in so doing.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient Servant<br/>
Nathl Lyons<br/>
Acting U.S. Consul</p>
