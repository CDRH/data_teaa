<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>The March 1911 issue of <em>The Crisis</em> illustrates the intimate iconographic connections between what is known as "Egyptomania" and Ethiopianism. All of the illustrations' captions conclude with the parenthetical "(After Lepsius)"&#x2014;a reference to the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius, whose copies of images found in ancient ruins leave the racial identities of the ancient Egyptians ambiguous and are copied here. The literary and artistic representations of ancient Egypt and Nubia commonly found in <em>The Crisis</em> overlap in a manner consistent with an Afrocentric ideology, one that asserts Black Africa's primacy. In an article accompanying the illustrations titled "African Civilization," M. D. Maclean&#x2014;the white female managing editor of <em>The Crisis</em>&#x2014;asserts that recent evidence suggests shared cultures and religions between ancient Egypt and the Black empires to the south (in modern-day Sudan), "only the idea now is that civilization came down the Nile instead of going up."</p>
