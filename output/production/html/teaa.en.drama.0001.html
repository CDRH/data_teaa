            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p class="tei_p">In part because of the continuing influence of minstrelsy on theater in the United States, revisionary depictions of Africa in African American drama lagged somewhat behind those in American Black fiction. An early musical comedy set in Africa starring the famous team of George Walker and Bert Williams (credited with popularizing the cakewalk), <em class="hi">In Dahomey</em> (1902) had lyrics by Paul Laurence Dunbar, book by Jesse A. Shipp, and music by Will Marion Cook. A parody of back-to-Africa movements, the story concerns two detectives, Shylock Homestead (Williams) and Rareback Pinkerton (Walker), hired by the Dahomey Colonization Society to find a missing treasure. According to one description of the play, all the characters "end up in Dahomey where they are nearly executed. They decide there's no place like home." The musical contained songs with lyrics such as "We are the loyal subjects of King Eat-Em-All,/The ruler over all our states both great and small" and "We'd sell big Georgia possums some watermelons too/To git the coin for the other things we'd like to do." Walker and Williams also appeared in and helped write the book for another musical set in Africa, Shipp and Alex Rogers's <em class="hi">Abyssinia</em> (1906).</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, there's a society down in Florida that's been pilin' up coin for years. Now that they're flush, they're goin' to go blow. They ain't satisfied to see their noodles ain't swelled on account of their dough, but they figure this country's a dead one. Some bloke tipped off Dahomey as the original Klondike and they're goin' against the brace, hook, line, and sinker. I'm goin' to steer the gang down to Gatorville where the main Gazaboo of the whole push hangs out. Say, fellows, I get two dollars a head from the captain of the dugout that snatches 'em away from this burg, and I've got a contract with a medicine shark, in all cases of sea sickness, we split the purse fifty-fifty. If anybody pegs out on the trip, I've got an undertaker waitin' at the wharf that gives me 35 percent of the net. Am I asleep at the switch, ask me?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Why say, Shy, that ain't nothin'. Old Sleuth and Nick Carter were both sent out to a western town to trace up some bankrobbers. The robbers got word of it somehow and way-laid the train about thirty miles from town. Imagine a mountain pass about fifty thousand feet above the level of the sea, a bridge suspended in mid-air over a chasm one thousand feet deep. A stormy night. The snow falling thick and fast and not a ship to be seen. The robbers, after removing the middle span of the bridge, fled like specters down the track to a curve a hundred yards away, and there behind a huge boulder lay in wait for the train. On rushed the fast mail. Every passenger was asleep excepting Nick Carter and Old Sleuth, and they were playing pinochle in the smoking apartment of the car. Crack, crack, crack and the whiplike report of a gatling gun rang out on the midnight air. Nick Carter was seen to rise suddenly to his feet and take from the hat rack a bottle of rye whiskey, take a drink and light a cigar and coolly raise the window to prevent the broken glass from entering the wounds made by the bullets of the bandits. Old Sleuth, always on the alert, threw a keg of beer out of window, and the robbers ceased firing long enough to secure the beer, by which time the train was well on its way to the deadly bridge, little dreaming of the danger ahead. Nick Carter sat down to trim his corns, when Old Sleuth whose hearing was wonderfully acute said: "Nick, the middle span is out of that bridge ahead. I can hear the air sucking the broken rails. Something must be done and at once. Quick as a flash, Nick cut the bell cord
with his corn knife, plunged through the window, caught the telegraph wire, which broke with his weight and swung him over the chasm. Letting go the wire, he dropped to the bottom, attached the bell cord to the span that had been removed, which fortunately had landed on a bed of marsh and remained intact, passed the other end to Old Sleuth, who had by this time reached the cow catcher of the engine and with superhuman effort, the span was snatched in place, the lives of the sleeping passengers saved.</p>

or chorus are costumed as frogs; the color scheme of costumes and scenery is the same. The chorus or ballet of ten girls and four men are posed beside a stream with backs to audience. Their backs are covered with leaves to look like foliage of the swamp until they turn and dance. The song "My Lady Frog" is sung by two idealized lovers in frog costumes who float down the stream in a canoe. The refrain is taken up by chorus. At the finish of the refrain, the ballet/chorus turn and face the audience to form a picture and they dance)</span>
