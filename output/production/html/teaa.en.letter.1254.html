      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of
your No. 9 of Nov. 1, 1898,
in reply to my No. 4 Consul
Series of Oct., 19, 1898,
relative to the 4 indigent
Todd children. In your
No. 9 of Nov. 1, 1898, you
suggest that "it would
have facilitated matters,
had I submitted an
estimate of the lowest
probable cast of sending the
four children from Monrovia
to New York."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have to inform you
that,

<span class="hr"> </span>

that I have dispatched
the matter of the desired
information to the Hon.,
Jas. Boyle, United States
Consul at Liverpool;
asking him to ascertain
the facts of the lowest probable
cost, from the Home
offices of the several
Steamship Companies,
plying between Monrovia,
Liverpool and New
York, and to so inform
the Department at Washington.
Reminding him,
however, that the Department
of State, assumed
no responsibility in the
matter.</p>

honor to be your obedient 
servant;<br/>
