      <p class="tei_p">Consulate of the United States<br/>
Zanzibar June 23 1890</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State<br/>
Washington D.C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Sir:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to address 
the Department at this
time in relation to affairs
on the Brava Coast.
On the 7th instant I cabled
as follows viz:</p>

      <p class="tei_p">"State Department<br/>
Washington.<br/>
Brava Coast unsettled
American interests jeopardized<br/>
Pratt"</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By letters received on
that date we learned of an
uprising of the natives at
Muka and that they had
looted the town - securing
some 150 <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> the American
house of Roper <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp; Co.
and

<span class="hr"> </span>

and upwards of 5000
from British Indian merchants.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Messrs Roper <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> &amp; Co.
who have large interests
at stake in that vicinity
immediately consulted with
me and it was at their
earnest solicitation that
I cabled the Department.
It being understood
that my cablegram would
supplement my statement
made to the Department by
representatives of R.E. &amp; Co.
who would visit Washington 
for that purpose.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The primary cause of
the disturbance is the concession 
of the Coast to the
Imperial British East
Africa Company and through
them to the Italians.
Having

<span class="hr"> </span>

Having spent some
months on the Brava Coast
and having acquainted
myself with the habits and
disposition of the natives
of that country. I am certain 
that any move in
the direction of European
interference will result in
complete demoralization.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The Italians disclaim
any present intention of
placing Europeans in that
district, and propose to
administer affairs from
Zanzibar.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">During a recent
interview with the Sultan
I expressed the hope that
he would discourage the
visits of Foreign ships of
war to that coast and
suggested that His Majesty 
send one of his own
ships with a commissioner
empowered

<span class="hr"> </span>

empowered to <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> with
the <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">natives[?]</span>. His Majesty
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear">proceeded[?]</span> to do so <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>
that such a <span class="unclear  tei_unclear">course[?]</span>
will be <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span> for
some <span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_two tei_unclear_extent_words tei_unclear">[?]</span> to the
difficulty in making a
landing at this season.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">By the granting of
the concession to the Imperial
British East African Company
the estate states of affairs
has been altered. Yet
I trust that the Department
may see its way clear
to call a halt in the direction
of European occupation
of this coast since otherwise
the Americans engaged
in that trade will suffer
a great loss, and perhaps
be compelled to retire
altogether from this hitherto
profitable field of
operations.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I

<span class="hr"> </span>

I await the sanction
of the Department before
sending in accounts for
cost of cablegram before
<span class="unclear  tei_unclear_extent_one tei_unclear_extent_word tei_unclear">[?]</span>.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor to be<br/>
Sir<br/>
Your obedient servant<br/>
Seth A. Pratt<br/>
U.S. Consul</p>
