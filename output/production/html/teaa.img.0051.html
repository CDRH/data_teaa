<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This image comes from <em>The Missionary Magazine</em>, which followed the convention of including photographs of mission fields in articles about missionaries serving abroad. This particular photo is of a generic village in "West Africa" in 1898. It depicts three children at play, perhaps, in the village. The photo does not show any missionary activities, as it is meant to depict "native" life and scenes for the viewer. As David Killingray and Andrew Roberts note, "Until the late nineteenth century, technical difficulties obstructed the dissemination of photographs in books and periodicals." It was easier to publish "bound albums of photographs prints." In this historical context, the cultural work performed by missionary photographs taken during the "new imperialism" cannot be understated. They were imported sources for colonial African history, although mediated through white-supremacist and Christiancentric lenses. Thus, this particular photograph, like others taken during this period, "between the 1890s and the first world war, photographs of Africa were published profusely to promote a variety of imperial, commercial, missionary, and scientific enterprises."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
