      <p class="tei_p">Hon William M Evarts,<br/>
Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am happy to inform the Department, that another
enterprise has been started for the purpose of utilizing 
the grand discoveries, recently made by our countryman,
Mr. H. M Stanley on the Congo or Livingston Messers 
Strom and Craven, two lay Missionary gentlemen, 
one route for the Congo, have passed a part of two 
days with me at this Agency. They have been sent 
out by philanthropic Merchants in Liverpool &amp;
London; to asscend the south bank of the Congo 
to a point above the first rapids, where they are 
to establish an industrial Christian Mission. 
These christian enterprises will prepare the way 
for the extention of commerce, &amp; steam navigation 
upon those vast interior rivers, &amp; the development
of the valuable material resources of Ethiopia.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I remain,<br/>
Sir,<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Your Obedient Servant<br/>
Albert Bushnell,<br/>
U.S. Com. A.</p>
