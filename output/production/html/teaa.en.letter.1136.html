      <p class="tei_p">Consulate General of the United States,<br/>
Monrovia, Liberia, February 17th 1890.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Honorable William F. Wharton,<br/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<br/>
Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Sir;</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I have the honor respectfully to acknowledge
the receipt of your No. 12. despatch of
January the 8th, informing me that the
despatch paper requested in my No. 42.
of November 11th 1889, had been
ordered to be sent.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The supplies, consisting of flag, record
book etc, previously forwarded,
came per S.S. "Benin" which reached
here on yesterday. I received Bill of
lading for the same, and sent aboard
the steamer for the case, but the
officers on the steamer failed to find
it though they turned about and
moved hundreds of other cases in search
for it. I hope to receive it, however, on the
homeward voyage of the steamer.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am, sir, your obedient servant,<br/>
Ezekiel E. Smith.<br/>
U.S. Consul General.</p>
