<p>that remote quarters of the world.</p>
    
<p>I am instincted to ask that the <unclear></unclear>
of the Independent State of the Congo will immediately
take steps to cause the restoration of the steamer 
in question to her legitimate owners, the
American Baptist Union at Stanley Port
and that the Government will cause a searching
investigation to be made of the arbitrary acts
said to have been done in this regard, by the
authorities of the State. Also that a prompt
and effective reparation be made for any
injury done to the owners by reason of the
forcible seizure of the Steamers.</p>
    
<p>I avail myself og the opportunity to
<unclear></unclear> to you, Sir, the assurances of my most
distinguished consideration.</p>
    
<p>Lambert Tree</p>
    
<p>Enclosure
Copy of letter from A. Billington to the American Consul
at St. Paul de Lounds dated August 3rd 1887.</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>American Baptist Missionary Union
Stanley Port. Congo Free State
August 3rd 1887</p>

<p>To the American Consul,
St. Paul de Lounds</p>
    
<p>Sir:</p>
    
<p>The above Society has a small Steamer on the
waters of the Upper Congo for the purpose of conveying
<unclear></unclear>to us to be necessary to have "papers" on
<unclear></unclear> Steamer still a few weeks aho. It has <unclear></unclear>
recently become necessary. In the first place for the
protection of the Mission property and in the Second
place, because, that after the 1st Sept. 1887 we
are compelled to fly the flag of the Congo Free State
but we are not allowed to fly any other flag until we
have the proper papers of our nationality on board</p>
    
 <p>In <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> when Mr. Stanley arrived here: he
 applied for the use of our steamer, but our circumstances
 <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> that we could do as he wished
 he then attempted to take the steamer by force,
 by placing an armed band at the <unclear></unclear> of
 our Mission Station, and another at the place
 where our  steamer was at another and then sent
 in a letter demanding the instant surrender of
 the steamer; in the case of my not complying his
 officers had orders to enforce the demand at any
 risk either to myself or those concerened. </p>
    
<p>Before anything was done, the chief of the
station of the "Congo Free State" at this place,
protested against Mr. Stanley's action in the <unclear>regime</unclear>
of the Staet, and the armed forces were withdrawn.
The chief of the Station of the Free State then
applied for the steamer, but our circumstances
remaining unaltered qe were obliged to refuse.</p>
    
<p><unclear>It</unclear> however, became very clear to us from conversation
and correspondance that the steamer would be
taken, so that we ultimately handed her over to
the Free State under protest for Mr. Stanley's
use for the space of 45 days. She <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> </p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>considerably beyond this zone by Mr. Stanley but 
after she had been sent away by him to be
returned to us, before reaching here she <unclear></unclear>
seized by another officer of the Free State.</p>
    
<p>This seizure took place at the State Station
<unclear></unclear> by Lieut. Vangele . This officer first
applied for the use of the steamer of the English
Baptist Mission, she being there at the same 
time, but being refused at once <unclear></unclear>
armed soldiers on board the "Henry Reed".
His action was protested against by some of <unclear></unclear>
in charge of the steamer but without effect <unclear></unclear>
the steamer has not yet been returned to us.</p>
    
<p>It was only yesterday that we received the
decree of the King respecting flags, and now we <unclear></unclear>
write to ask if you wil kindly arrange for us 
get the "Papers" as early as possible that we may
be able to use the American Flag.</p>
    
<p>I enclose particulars of the steamer and
hope they will meet all requirememnts.</p>
    
<p>I have the honor, voc.,
A. Billington
Member of the American Baptist Mission
Union and in charge of the Fair Steamer</p>
