<opener>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
November 18th, 1881.</opener>

<p>Sir,<lb/>
Thinking the following
particular may prove of interest,
I have the honor to lay before
the Department the following 
extracts of a letter received from
Mr N. S. Beut, an Englishman
at present at Mossamedes,
with reference to the Boers
who have lately settled at 
Humpata, under Portuguese
rule, where he visited them.</p>

<p>" The Boers left the Transvaal
" about 5 years ago, and arrived
" at a place called Humpata,
" a distance of 120 miles from
" Mossamedes or Little Fish Bay.
" They left the Transvaal membering
" about 700 persons, men
" women and children, and 
" have been traveling the
" Country in all directions for
<catchwords>5 years"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.002"/>
" 5 years in the hope of hitting
" upon a suitable place to gain
" a reasonable likelihood. In
" February 1881 they arrived at
" Humpata, a place up to that
" date <unclear>unacquainted</unclear> by the Portuguese
" but appertaining to
" the Province of Angola, and
" decided to take up their abode
" there, and have now corn (wheat) 
" in large quantities, Potatoes and
" Vegetables of all descriptions, and
" intend to grow vines for the
" production of wine, and 
cotton, as the means of gaining
" their livelihood.</p>

<p>" They number today 420
" people about 200 of whom are
" women and children, the remainder
" having died on the journey.
" They seem to be a very hardworking
" peacible set of people.
" and have placed, themselves
" entirely under Portuguese law
" and protection, and have a 
<catchwords>Portuguese"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.003"/>
" Portuguese Officer and 1/2 dozen
" soldiers residing amongst them
" in a sort of hut termed a fort,
" where the Portuguese Flag flies.
" the land is free from any tax
" for 10 years. The Boers have
" executed a wonderful piece
" of work in the shape of a
" canal, the ingenuity of which
" the Portuguese marvel at, they
" having brought water into the
" place, which was the first thing
" they did after they settled, bringing
" it from a distance of 3 1/4  miles,
" and now a running stream of 
" pure Iron water passes by the
" front of each house. There are
" 44 different houses today, the
" construction of all of which
" being very similar, having a
" thatched roof and walls composed
" of stone sand and clay.
" The land of Humpata is pretty
" fertile, and Copper and Iron
abounds in large quantities, but
<catchwords>no"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.004"/>
" no person has troubled themselves
" as yet about either.</p>

<p>" Lions, Leopards, Elephant,
" Camel, Wolf, Ostrich, Giraffe,
" Hippopatmus, Aligator, Wild
" Goat; and many beautiful birds
" are found in great abundance
" close to this district; and the
" Boers have every hopes of being
" able to carry on a good business
" in the export of Ivory and
" Ostrich feathers to England
" and the Cape. They have about
" 70 Horses and 2500 head of
" cattle, but are losing day by
" day horses and bullocks, owing
" to the scarcity of proper pasture.
" the natives (Gambos) being in the 
" habit of daily setting fire in 
" all parts to the good grass.</p>

<p>" The Boers have frequently
" complained to the Governor of 
" Mossamedes, Senhor Sebastian
" Rumes de Matta, but up to 
" date that gentleman has not 
<catchwords>been</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.005"/>
" been able to move in the matter,
" except in two cases where the
" natives had to compensate the 
" Boers for the death of 4 bullocks,
" and where the Boers received
" compensation in cattle from
" the natives for having willfully
" stabbed several valuable horses.</p>

<p>" The Tribe of the Gambos
" have attacked the Boers on two 
" different occassions, with the
" view to driving them out of the
" place, but repulsed; and the
" Gambos are now gradually
" settling down to the idea that
" they must submit to the "White-dogs,"
" as they call them, having
" taken possession of part of their 
" country.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Goverment
" has arranged with the Boers to 
" to give them R 2,500 for the purpose
" of opening a Carriage road from 
" Humpata to Little Fish Bay
<catchwords>and"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.006"/>
" and the Boers commenced the
" work on the 20th September last.
This work I hear was calculated
by some Portuguese Engineers
to cost about R 20,000.</p>

<p>" It is calculated that the
" road will take 6 months to 
" make, when the Boers will
" have communication by cars
" with the Merchants in the Bay.
" At present it is impossible to 
" travel by car, the only way 
" being by Hammock or on
" Horse-back, there being at about
" 4 Leagues from Humpata, a very 
" steep ascent called Shella, the
" only available passsage, and
" where no person can ascend on
" horse-back, or even in a Hammock
" but is obliged to ascend on
" foot, the ascent taking 3 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>" The waters in this
" district (Shella and Bruco)
" is beautiful, there being such a 
" quantity of Iron in the district,
<catchwords>and"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.007"/>
" and it is even better in Humpata
" and Huilla, the latter place being
" about 18 to 20 miles S.E. of Humpata.</p>

<p>" The writer, the first Englishman
" who has visited the colony of the
" Boers, was wonderfully well received
" and was able to give them
" all the news of the war in the
" Transvaal, and the news he communicated
" to them of the conclusion
" of the war created great excitement,
" and for 24 hours after, succeeded
" a series of thanksgiving's to the
" Almighty for having brought
" to a conclusion such an unhappy
" war. Almost all these people
" had relations who fought in
" the war, and up to date do
" not know who was killed or
" saved, they having had all
" their letters stopped since the 
" commencement. It is not known 
" where this happened.</p>

<p>" Humpata is a most
" healthy locality, and at this 
<catchwords>time"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.008"/>
" time of the year (November) is 
" almost as cold as November in
" England. It lies in a valley
" almost entirely surrounded by
" rocky montains the country
" on all sides for 3 Leagues being 
" mountainous. The name of the
" Commander is Josephino. F. Botha,
" and the secretary Peter S. Botha.
" Each man is supposed to have
" about £ 50 in English Gold they
" are said to have altogether
" about £ 7000</p> 

<p>"It is expected that another
" Colony will shortly arrive termed
" by the Boers, Bastards, being
" the children of a Boer Father
" and a Hottentot Mother. They
" number some 1000 people, and it
" is reported by a Swedish hunter,
" that they intend to travel down
" here, with a view to settling
" about 20 Leauges S.E. of Humpata
" with the same intention as the Boers
<catchwords>These"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.009"/>
" These people at present are said
" to be near Cape Town, but are being
" driven away into the interior
" Through the English farmers
" there buying ground daily.</p>

<p>" The Portuguese hold great
" expectations from the Establishment
" of the Boers at Humpata on
" account of the export of Ivory,
" Feathers, and Cotton, and the 
" production of Wine and Flour."</p>
