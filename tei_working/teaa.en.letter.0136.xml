<opener>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
November 18th, 1881.</opener>

<p>Sir,
Thinking the following
particular may prove of intent,
I have the honor to lay before
the Department the following 
extracts of a letter received from
Mr N. S. Beut, and Englishman
at present at Mossamedes,
with reference to the Boers
who have lately settled at 
Humpata, under Portuguese
rule, where he visited them.</p>

<p>" The Boers left the Transvaal
" about 5 years ago, amd arrived
"at a place called Humpata,
" a distance of 120 miles from
"Mossamedes or Little Fish Bay.
" They left the Transvaal membering
" about 700 persons, men
" women and children, and 
" have been traveling the
" Country in all directions for
<catchwords>5 years"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.002"/>
"5 years in the hope of hitting
"upon a suitable place to gain
"a reasonable likelihood. In
"February 1881 they arrived at
" Humpata. a place up to that
"date consequented by the Portuguese
"but appertaining to
" the Province of Angola, and
"decided to take up these above
"there, and have now corn (wheat) 
"in large quantities, Potatoes and
"Vegetables of all description, and
"intend to grow vines for the
" production of mice, and 
cotton, as the means of gaining
" their livelihood.</p>

<p>" They number today #20
" people without 200 of whom are
"women and children, the remainder
"barking died on the journey.
"They seem to be a very hardworking
" peaceible act of people.
" and have placed, themselves
"entirely under Portuguese law
"and protection, and leave a 
<catchwords>Portuguese"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.003"/>
"Portuguese Officer and 1/2 dozen
" soldiers residing amongst them
" in a sort of but termed a fort,
"where the Portuguese Flag flies.
"the land is free from any say
" for 10 years. The Boers have
" executed a wonderful piece
"of work in the shape of a
"casual, the ingennity of which
"the Portuguese marvel at, they
" having brought water into the
" place, which was the first thing
" they did after they settled, bringng
" it from a distance of 3 1/4  miles,
" and now a running stream of 
" pure Iron water passes by the
" front of each house. There are
" 44 different houses today, the
"construction of all of which
" being very similar, having a
"thatched roof and walls composed
" of stone sand and clay.
" The land of Humpata is pretty
" fertile, amd Copper and Iron
abounds in large quantities , but
<catchwords>no"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.004"/>
"no person has troubled themselves
" as yet about either.</p>

<p>"Lions, Leopards, Elephant,
"Camel, Wolf, Ostrich, Giraffe,
"Hippopatmus, Aligator, Wild
" Goat; and many beautiful birs
" are found in great abundace
"close to this district; and the
" Boers have every hopes of being
"able to carry on a good business
" in the export of Ivory and
" Ostrich feathers to England
" and the Cape. They have about
" 70 Horses and 2500 head of
"battle, but are costing day by
" day horses and bullocks, owing
" to the scarcity of proper pasture.
" the natives (Gambos) being in the 
" habit of daily setting fire in 
" all parts to the good grass.</p>

<p>" The Boers have frequently
"complained to the Governor of 
"Mossamedes, Senhor Sebastian
"Rumes de Matta, but up to 
"date that gentleman has not 
<catchwords>beem</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0136.005"/>
"been able to move in the matters,
" except in two cases where the
" nations had to compensate the 
" Boers for the death of 4 bullocks,
" and where the Boers received
" compensation in battle from
" the natives for having writfully
"stabbed several valuable horses.
" The Tribe of the Gamvos
" have attacked the Boers on two 
"different occassions, with the
" view to driving them out of the
" place, but repulsed; and the
" Gambos are now gradually
" settling down to the idea that
" they must submit ot the "White-dogs,"
" as they call them, having
"taken possession of part of their 
"country.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Goverment
" has arranged with the Boers to 
" to give them R 2,500 for the purpose
" of opening a Carriage road from 
" Humpata to Little Fish Bay
<catchwords>and"</catchwords></p>
