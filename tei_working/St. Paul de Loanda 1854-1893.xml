<ab>Loanda S.W. Coast of Africa<lb/>
January 12th 1854</ab>

<ab>Hon. Wm. L Marcy<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
U. S. America</ab>

<p>Sir.<lb/>
By the Bark "Seamen"
which vessel arrived at Ambriz on the 28th ult. I had
the pleasure of receiving a Commision from your
Department as U. S. Coml. Agent for Loanda.
On the arrival of the "Seamen" at this port I shall
without doubt recieve the U.S. Flag, Seal of Office,
&#38; several Books which I am informed are on board. </p>

<p>On the 12th November 1853, Commodore Mayo
commissioned me as Acting U. S. Consul, the Governor of
this Province accepted me as such as far as his power
so to do extended &#38; my name has been sent to the
Queen of Portugal for confirmation.</p>

<p>Taking into
consideration these circumstances I now take the
liberty of requesting the President to appoint me
U. S. Consul instead of U. S. Coml. Agent.</p>

<p>The fees as Consul for this port will not amount
to more than $70 or $80 a year.</p>

<p>You will please inform me if a Commander
of a U. S. Man of War has a right to put men taken
from an alleged or real slaver on shore at this port &#38;
if so &#38; these men are taken sick or need assistance is
the Consul obliged to render such assistance. </p>

<p>You will also please inform me if the Consignee 
of an American vessel is obliged to hand the Invoices

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0001"/>

of the Cargo homeward to the Consul in order that the 
Consul may certify the correctness of the same and
also the value of the Spanish dollar in this currency.</p>

<p>As regards the Bond which you sent me I shall
forward it to Salem for the Signatures by the first direct
opportunity which however will probably not be till
March or April.</p>

<p>I shall send to your Department a list
of American Vessels entering or clearing at this port
&#38;c every six months.</p>

<p>In answer to your request to
inform the Department the name of the State in
which I was born, I will say I was born in Salem,
in the State of Massachusetts, &#38; I have always resided
there with the exception a few months passed in
Rio Grande, Brazil, till I came to Loanda, at which 
place arrived in September 1853.</p>

<p>I should have 
wrote you previous to this in relation to my appointment
by Com. Mayo but as my friends had made the request
at Washington I deemed it unnecessary till I received
advices from your Department.</p>

<p>Any Letters or Instructions
that you may be pleased to send me you can
direct to the care of R Brookhouse Esq. Salem,
Mass. who will forward them by first opportunity.</p>

<ab>Very Respectfully,<lb/>
Your Obt. Servt<lb/>
John G. Willis</ab>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0002"/>


<p>The "Constitution" sailed from Loanda for St. Helena Nov 17, '53.</p>
<p>The "Marion" is now in the neighborhood of the Congo River &#38; Ambriz. </p>
<p>The "Perry" has not been here since February '53.</p>

on you in favor of Eliza Willis of Salem Mass for
twenty-eight &#38; 93/100 dollars, being the amount paid
by me for Flagstaff &#38;c as <unclear>to</unclear> Bill which accompanies
the draft. </p>

<p>I have not yet sent the Bond owing to my
request to be appointed Consul instead of Coml Agent
&#38; as to my Letter of Jany 12th via England for this Port,
presuming if I received the appointment of Consul
it might require a different Bond.</p>

<p>Trusting the
request previously alluded to will receive your kind
attention.</p>

<p>Mr. J G Willis, the present Commercial Agent 
was appointed to this office August 23, 1853.
He is now in the United States and asks an
extension of his leave of absence for the reasons
mentioned in his letter which is hereto annexed.</p>

<p>The salary which was not affixed
to the office till the 1st of January 1857 is only
$1000.</p>

<p>The fees in 1854 were $142.00

<p>Mr Willis appears to have discharged his duties
quite efficiently in an unhealthy climate; he
returned to the United States to recount his health,
after an attack of the African fever.</p>

<p>There is but a single applicant for the place,
<unclear>Mr. Silva</unclear>, whose papers are hereto annexed.</p>

<ab>Salem Mass February 12 1858</ab> 

<p>Sir<lb/>
I last had the honor of receiving
from the State Department a despatch of Nov 21
1857 extending my leaving of absence from the U. S.
Coml Agency at St. Paul de Loanda till March 58.</p>

<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to inform 
you that I now intend to leave this port for Loanda
during the next month &#38; would very respectfully 
request your notice of a few remarks in relation to
the Commercial Agency at that port.</p>

<p>By referring to my former despatches you
will please perceive I have frequently alluded to
the order of the Portuguese Government of depositing
the Registers of American vessels with the Custom
House authorities at Loanda instead of with the
U. S. Coml Agent. I have during my stay there
used my best exertions in endeavoring to have the
Registers in my possession while the vessel remained
in port, but the Governor would not allow me to keep
them. As I consider this "order" conflicts with the
U. S. Law of Feby 28 1803, I would respectfully
request some further instructions on this subject.</p>

<p>There is also a very important subject which
I wish to bring to the notice of the Department viz.
the subject of a Burial place in Loanda for American
Citizens. The English some years since had a
small lot of Ground granted them by the Portguese
Government for the purpose. In October 1856 I
had occasion to request the Resident English Commissioner
or Arbitrator {Mr E Gabriel}  for the privilege of
burial in their cemetery of an American Ship master
{Capt Wells of the Brig Charlotte of New York}  who
died in the Congo River on the 13th Sept whose body


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.10002"/>

was placed in a Cask of Rum &#38; and brought to Loanda
in said Brig but through some misunderstanding Mr. 
Gabriel finally declined to have the body placed there
unless it was taken out of the Cask &#38; and placed in a Coffin.
I requested the Government to give me liberty to employ the 
Physico Mor to arrange it but on account of some fears
they had in respect to contagion the Government declined
the body was buried with the Cask in the vicinity.
If your honor will direct the U. S. Minister at Loanda
to apply to the Portguese Government for a small lot of
Ground for this purpose, I have no doubt but what they
would comply with the request. I would add that it
would not be necessary to go to any expense at present
as regards fencing &#38;c The English have not as yet expended
anything on their grounds but I understood there
had been an application made to Government for an
Iron fence as a Wood fence would not last any length
of time.</p>

<p>I would request permission in case of sickness,
to leave my post for a longer time than the two days if necessary.</p>

<p>I notice in the List of Diplomatic Consular
&#38; other Agents of the United States that I am the
only Coml Agent in the Portuguese Dominions &#38; if the
Department would make this office a Consulate instead of 
of Coml Agency it would have a good effect in the Government
at Loanda.</p>

<p>I have also to request the Department to send
me a flag also a small flag for a Boat &#38; if you think
it advisable to change the Office to a Consulate, to
send me at the same time a Seal of Arms.</p>

<p>The Slave Trade has been of late carried on to
a great extend on the S W Coast of Africa by vessels 
sailing from Ports in the U States &#38; Havana some of

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.10003"/>


which are owned by Portuguese living in New York 
who through some Ship Brokers manage to elude the 
vigilance of the U. S. authorities in that City.</p>

<p>This System interferes very much with those engaged
in legal trade as they in order to make a good appearance
at the Custom House have a regular Cargo, which
when the vessel arrives on the Coast is forced on the
market at any price.</p>

<p>The English Commanders of Govenment vessels
on the Coast have in many instances taken great liberties
with American Vessels &#38; the presence of one or
more U. S. Vessels is very important for legal &#38;
illegal trade. The weather on the SW Coast is always
good &#38; the harbour of Loanda is very fine, good
water &#38; Provisions of all kinds can always be procured
there at much cheaper sales than elsewhere on the Coast.</p>

<p>Any communication you may have to forward 
me please direct to Salem, Mass.</p>

<ab>Huntsville, Alabama<lb/>

<p>Sir,<lb/>
The President having some time since 
tendered me the appointment of Consul
of the United States at Loanda I have
felt anxious to so arrange my private
affairs as to be able to accede to his
wishes and to proceed as soon as possible
to the post assigned me. I regret
now, however, to be compelled to advise
you that imperious circumstances deny
me the pleasure, at present, of obeying
this call to the public service. I, therefore,
most respectfully decline the acceptance
of the tender made me; and in doing
so, beg leave, through your Department,
to offer to the President my sincere acknowledgements
for this evidence of his
favor and confidence.</p>

<p>No 2. United States Commercial Agency<lb/>
St. Paul Loanda January 26 1859</p>

<p>Sir, <lb/>
I last had this honor under date of
October 11, '58, informing you that I had arrrived
at this Port &#38; had entered upon the duties of this 
office. I also informed you that the American Yacht
Wanderer was then in the Congo River during the
latter part of the month She left the River &#38; it is
said, with a Cargo of Slaves. </p>

<p>Since the capture &#38; burning of the Brig Rufus 
Soulé off the Congo by H.B. M. Steamer Viper
in October last, a statement of which was given
to Capt. Totten of the U.S.S. Vincennes I have
heard of four or five shipments being made, the last
one a few days since in which the thousand Slaves
were placed on board one vessel. The Trade has now
gone in part from the Congo River to the North of
that river. Owing to the French Apprentice System,
Slaves are rather scarce &#38; the price has advanced.
It is said there are a number of vessels off the
Coast waiting for the Consigned to arrange a
Congo.</p>

<p>On the 8th December Sir Henry 
Huntley, H. B. M. Consul for this Port arrived
now. He came out as a Consul &#38; Clerk to the

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.10011-2"/>


English Slave Commission presuming that Mr 
Gabriel, H B M Arbitatior would return to England,
&#38; then he would be acting Arbitatror &#38; Consul; but as
Mr Gabriel does not intend leaving this at present, Sir
Henry is officiating as Consul without accepting the
post as Clerk to the Commission &#38; waiting for further
instructions from his Government.</p>

<p><sic>Accompaning</sic> this I enclose the Returns 
from this Commercial Agency for the Quarter ending 
December 31, 1858 &#38; have drawn on Your Honor for 
Two Hundred forty-four &#38; 07/100 dollars being balance
of my Salary for that Quarter. I am not able to 
fill up the blanks with the exact value of the Inward
&#38; Outward cargoes for the reason that a vessel entering
to clearing at this Custom House is not obliged to place
on her Manifest the value thereof. For a year estimate
of the American Business done at this Port I should
say that at the present time I will not exceed
One hundred thousand dollars. Two or three years
ago it would amount to one hundred &#38; fifty thousand
dollars but since that time the Crop of Palm
Oil has failed &#38; the Natives are obliged to eat the
Palm Nut to keep from starvation.  Palm Oil it 
is now thought will this year prove very fair &#38; if so
it will enable the Portuguese Merchants here to pay
their Debts which in may instances have been standing

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.10012-2"/>


very long-\- their debts once settled will cause the two 
American Houses here to order larger Invoices &#38; then of 
course the Business will again increase.</p> 

<p>It is the wish of the Governor General of the Province
to take possession of the River Congo, but I understand the
English Government will not allow them to go North of
Ambriz. If Portugal should take that River there will
be no more Slave Trade there &#38; perhaps England may in
time change her views in this respect as it will save her
considerable expense in taking of the African Squadron.</p>

<p>The occupation of Ambriz by the Portuguese has not
yet resulted favorably. They have been at considerable expense
&#38; there is now only one foreign House there &#38; that
an American- The one English House that formerly done business
at Ambriz, have now left on account of the
high duties &#38; {which are more than Mr O'Sullivan the
late U. S. Minister at Gabon was given to understand
by the Portuguese Minister} &#38;  have gone to a place
called "Kisembo" 7 miles north of Ambriz, together
with a Branch of the American House &#38; a Dutch
House where they got a clear of all Custom House charges
&#38; at the same time do considerable Trade with the Natives.</p>


<p>The Copper Mines at Ambriz have not proved
so favorable as they were at first expected &#38; it is said
will result in a great less to those concerned.</p>

<p>Some time since, I wrote the Department in

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.10013-2"/>


respect to a Burial Place in Loanda for deceased
Americans &#38; under date of February 15 1858 I am
informed by the Department that the United States
Minister at the court of Lisbon will be informed of
my request. As yet nothing relating thereto has been
received at this agency &#38; I now take the liberty of 
again calling the attention of the Department to this
subject.</p>

<p><sic>Accompaning</sic> this I enclose the Returns from
this Commercial Agency for the Quarter ending
March 31 59 &#38; have drawn on your Honor for
$238.89 being balance of my Salary for that
Quarter.</p>

<p>In my last I gave an estimate of the 
American Trade at this Port which I trust
will serve the same purpose as if I entered the
amount of the Inward &#38; Outward cargoes in the
Returns which estimate can be now placed at
One hundred thousand dollars per annum</p>

<p>It is reported now that the U. S. S. "Marion"
has taken as Prizes in the Congo River a Bark

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.20002"/>

called the "Orion" of New York &#38; another Bark
name not reported. H B M Steamer "Triton"  
Comr Burton had the "Orion" in tow one or two
days previous to the arrivals there of the "Marion", while
at the same time the "Orion" had the American Ensign
flying. Capt Brent of the "Marion" will undoubtedly
inform his Department of the particulars in
this case.</p>

<p>It is also reported that the U. S. Government
have made a proposition to England, that they
will place on this Coast Ten Steamers of two Guns each
instead of the Eighty Guns in large vessels. If so, it
will do much in stopping the Slave Trade on this Coast
As a Depot for Coals or Provisions  Loanda has 
not its equal on the Coast of Africa. For further 
particular respecting the advantages of this place. I 
respectfully refer you to my former despatches.</p>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
a despatch from your Department under date of Dec
13 1858 advising me of the resignation of Mr Miller
&#38; requesting me to continue in the discharge of the
duties of the office till the further pleasure of the
President is ascertained which request I respectfully

<p>Sir<lb/>
The <sic>inclosed</sic> abstract 
from my ship's log will sufficiently
explain itself.</p>

<p>While on this coast last
voyage in 1857 &#38; 8 we were chased,
fired into with shot guns hove to
and detained on our voyage on two
different occasions by English
Cruisers. Since then our government
having conveyed to that of the
English an assertion of a plain
and explicit denial of the right
of any foreign ships of war to stop or
detain any merchant ship bearing
the American flag upon the high
seas under any circumstances or
pretense whatever and the English
Government having assented to it
and disclaimed all such right
we had not anticipated being
again subjected to such <sic>shamefull</sic>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.20005"/>

<sic>disgracefull</sic>, troublesome and most 
disagreeable delays involving loss
of time to the ships and pecuniary
loss to her owners which latter is especially
the case on the occasion as our commission
was urgent its success depending
upon our reaching "Principi" in
time to anticipate the advices for
there <unclear>per</unclear> mail steamer "Estephania"
to sail the day after us from Loanda
for St Thomas with mails for "Principi"
to be forwarded from there.</p>

<p>You therefore realise in some measure
how vexatious was the delay to
which we were subjected and the
pecuniary loss involved may be very
considerable.</p>

we shall meet with welcome and
prompt attention in protection of our

Herewith I enclose Returns from
this Commercial Agency for the Quarter ending
March 31, 1860. The several accounts &#38; certificates
I have directed to the Treasury Department
&#38; have drawn in the Hon. Secretary of Treasury
for $227.11&#162; being balance of my Salary for that
Quarter.</p>

<p>I last had the honor of addressing you
under date of January 24 enclosing Returns
for the Quarter ending December 31, 1859 at
which time I requested leave of absence to take
effect as soon as practicable after the receipt of your
answer which I trust has been granted.</p>

<p>For these months past there has been considerable
trouble at Ambriz &#38; Kisembo caused by the receipt
of a Letter at Ambriz sent by H. B. M. Commissioner
of this place, but said to have been written by the
Brazilian Consul of this Port _ said Letter being
directed to His Royal Highness Don Nicolau
Prince of Congo &#38;c &#38;c said Nicolau a Black
being at the time employed by the Portuguese 
Govern-
<catchwords>-ment</catchwords>
<fw>Hon. Lewis Cass<lb/>
Secretary of State</fw>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.30002-2"/>

ment at Ambriz in some moderate capacity.</p> 

<p>The letter informed "Nicolau" that the Governor-
General of this Province intended to imprison him
for writing to the Libson Journals in respect to his
Government &#38; advising him to leave immediately for
Kisembo. On his arrival at Kisembo he entered
an English house &#38; soon afterwards the Natives collected
&#38; demanded him. After considerable delay
Don Nicolau was given up &#38; immediately shot &#38; beheaded
by the natives.</p>

<p>As there is an American House at Kisembo
owned by Messrs Brookhouse &#38; Co. of Salem Mass. I
at once on hearing the proceedings of the Natives requested
Capt Colhoun of the U S S Portsmouth to
go there to which he immediately complied.
On his arrival at Kisembo &#38; during his stay there of
two or three days, everything was quiet.  Some days
afterwards the Gov. Genrl of this Province went with
a force of 300 to 400 men to Ambriz &#38; Kisembo-
At the latter place they burnt the native town &#38; then
returned to Loanda.  While the Portguese troops
were at Kisembo Capt Brent of the U S S "Marion"
together with Capt Fitzroy of the H B M S Falcon were
in here with a number of their men on the arrival
of the Gov Genrl with his troops requesting permission
to enter the Houses for replenishment &#38; Rest, he was

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.30003-2"/>


refused, as it was the opinion of the Residents there
that if the Portuguese entered: their lives &#38; property
would not be as secure after the Portuguese
Americans &#38; English left, as they would if they were
not allowed to enter. Since then the Natives
have made two unsuccessful attacks in Ambriz.
Trade continues to be bought in by the Natives to
Kisembo &#38; it is now quiet there.</p>

<p>About the 1st of April some Portuguese Soldiers
were coming from the Copper Mines to Ambriz &#38; 
when within 15 miles of the latter place they were
attacked by a large number of Natives &#38; obliged to
retreat. in doing so they jumped into the River
"Logi" in order to cross to the other side. Their
loss was near 100 including one Lady, the Wife of 
the officer in command of the Party.</p>

<p>The roads between Ambriz &#38; the Mines
are filled with Natives &#38; the Portguese have
collected a force of about 1000 men to march
into the Interior. They left Ambriz on the 21st
to punish the Natives &#38; also open the roads to
the Mines.  This force is commanded by the
best of the Portuguese officers attached to this Province,
&#38; it is thought will be sufficient to drive
the Natives from the vicinity.</p>

<p>This interference of H. B. M. Commissioner

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.30004-2"/>


&#38; the Brazilian Consul General has been the source
of great anxiety to the Government of this Province,
&#38; causing great expense. It will probably result
in the Portuguese Government requesting the withdrawal
of the above mentioned parties from their
official functions.</p>

<p>Under date of October 23rd I had
the honor of addressing you &#38; enclosing Relations
for the Quarter ending September 30 '60 The
fever then prevailing here I am now pleased to
say was of short duration &#38; did not affect the 
old residents much being mostly confined to newcomers.</p>

<p>I have now to inform Your Honor that
your despatch of August 10th respecting the disposition
made by the British Government of the
Africans captured from Slavers by the British
Navy, &#38; also as to the disposition made by that
Government of the officers &#38; crews of these Slavers
<catchwords>was</catchwords>
<fw>Hon Lewis Cass

was not received of this Agency 'till November &#38;
as I could not send an answer in season for the
next session of Congress. I have delayed it till the
present time.</p>

<p>As regards the disposition of the 
Africans, I cannot give you any reliable information,
but presuming you have sent the same circular to the
U S Consuls at St. Helena, Sierra Leone &#38; English
West Indies, they will be able to give such information
to the Department as is now required.</p>

<p>Respecting the disposition of officers &#38; crews
of Slavers I have to inform your Honor that when 
a suspected vessel is boarded by the English, such inducments
&#38; threats as given that the Master suspects
more is known of him then in fact really is which
generally leads to the giving up the vessel, when the
officers have their choice of giving to St. Helena or
Sierra Leone or being landed at some convenent
place on the Coast. The Crews nine times out
of ten are put on shore immediately - If they are
fortunate enough to be landed near the Congo River
they can find friends among the Traders there who
keep them till an opportunity offers of Shipping when
they take this chance again- but many have been 
left in desolate parts of the Coasts &#38; if they escaped 
being killed or robbed by the passing tribes they have

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.30011-2"/>

generally died of African fever or hunger.
Although it sometimes happens that one or two Americans 
are found among the crews of vessels, yet
generally they are comprised of Portuguese <add place="above">&#38;</add> Spaniards.</p>

<p>Your despatch of November 1st informing me
that some Consular forms &#38; a Boat flag have been
sent to my address is received- the vessel being 
the above is now in port &#38; on receipt of the package 
I am in hopes to find that instead of a "Boat flag"
I shall find one for the "Consulate flag staff" that
being what I requested in my despatch No 10 under
date Sept 15th.</p>

<p>The Portuguese have again been
fighting with the Natives North of this- burning
several Towns &#38;c but as the Towns are built of Mud
&#38; Straw, the damage done did not amount to much
except helping clear rather largely on the Angola
Treasury, which is &#38; has been for a long time in a

<p>Sir,<lb/>
I last had the honor of addressing
the State Department under date of January 22nd
enclosing Returns from this Commercial Agency
for the Quarter ending Dec 31 1861 also giving
some information in respect to the disposition made
by the British Government of the Africans captured
from slavers by the British Army &#38; also as to the
disposition made by that Government of the officers
&#38; Crews of the slavers which I trust has ere
this been received.</p>

<p>I have now to inform your Honor that
there is a prospect of a very serious affair occurring
between this Government of Angola &#38; that of
the United States owing to the imprisonment of
Mr E A Birnie Naval Storekeeper for the U <!-\- in other document this name is definitely Bernie -\->
S Squadron on this Coast.  The facts as near 
as I can accertain from Mr Birnie, his brother
&#38; two Cabindas who were in the storehouse at the 
time are that on the 9 March a Portuguese
named Oliveira who had sold Mr. Birnie
some wood, went into Mr B house to get the payment
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<fw>To the<lb/>
Hon. Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington DC</fw>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.30013-2"/>

of his account. Mr B told him he would 
pay if Oliveira would deduct the price of 100
sticks {value $1.25&#162;} which he had not received.
Oliveira said he could not deduct anything as he
thought he had delivered the number according to
his bill. Birnie told him he would not pay
unless Oliveira made the deduction. Oliveira
being ready to leave for <unclear>Mossamedes</unclear> in the Steamer
then about to start &#38; not wishing to go before settling
the Bill began talking very loud &#38; calling
Birnie harsh names. Birnie then told him to
leave the office which he refused to do till he
received his money Birnie sent for the Police
but they could not come without an order from
the Chief who was not then to be found. Oliveira
continued his insulting remarks when Birnie took
hold of him to put him out when Oliveira struck
Birnie with his Cane &#38; Birnie returned the blow-
several blows passed between them &#38; Oliveira was
considerably hurt in his head &#38; had his arm broke.
Oliveira went to the Judge &#38; entered his complaint
against Birnie &#38; his brother William {who says he
did not strike Oliveira but only helped his Brother
Edward put Oliveira out of the room}. Although
the complaint was made on the 9th March the warrant
for the arrest of E A and William Bernie was not
<catchwords>served</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.30014-2"/>

served till the 25th __ on which day Mr Birnie 
went to the Judge in company with myself
in order to get Bail. After an examination
{part of which was forced &#38; without the aid
or liberty of obtaining Counsel} Mr B was
ordered to be taken to prison -which although
may do to keep Portuguese is not fit for Americans
in the situation of Mr Birnie in this country.-
Mr B having been in the habit of corresponding
with flag officer Inman wrote him that he
had been ordered to prison &#38; requesting advice
the flag officer requested me to obtain Counsel
for Mr B which I did but as yet the Counsel
has not been able to get Mr B out in bail although
the Doctor has pronounced Oliveira in no
danger of his life. Several Communications
have passed between the Governor &#38; flag officer,
&#38; I now understand flag officer Inman had
<hi rend="underline">demanded</hi> the release of Mr Birnie by 12 N 
this day.</p>

<p>There is considerable excitement on
board the "Constellation," Portsmouth, Mystic
&#38; Sumpter" which vessels are now lying in
this harbor. The San Jacinto left this on
the 3rd inst to meet the "Mohican" which latter
vessel has the Mails from the States via

<p>1st Witness William K Maxwell
Master of Ship "Clara L. Preble".</p>

<p>On Sunday
2 March 1862 John Borges American
Citizen with Lucius Fields and three
others was on shore, gave them liberty
until 6 O'Clock P.M. a little over their
time they came back to the Boat
together being in liquor went on board
the Ship "Clara L. Preble" and went to the
forecastle about half an hour after I was
called by the mate, saying there is a
quarrel in the forecastle and having
Knives out, I immediately went to
the forecastle saw John Borges with a
Sheath knife in his hand also saw
the deceased with a Razor in his

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.40013-2"/>

hand being stabbed in the left breast
bleeding freely I asked John Borges for
the Knife he immediately gave it to me
I also asked the deceased to give me his
razor he refused was obliged to take it
from him by force, soon after I saw
him lying on the deck, I gave orders for
him to be taken up and carried to the
forecastle I sent for the Doctor from the
Portuguese Steamer "Zaire" then Coaling
from my Ship and he was of the opinion that
the Stab was mortal, I went aft and
then came forecastle in a few minutes,
the man was still alive I went aft again
and shortly after was told that he was
dead during the voyage I have no reason
to suppose any ill feeling existed 
between the prisoner and deceased 
previously that should lead him to
commit the assault nor was he a 
disorderly man nor was the deceased 
after the deceased had been stabbed he
threatened to cut the prisoner being very
much intoxicated.</p>

<p>Prisoner and deceased
went on shore with Captain Maxwell and
returned on board a little after Sun Set,
the Carpenter Benjamin Rees reported to me
that two of the men were quarrelling in the
forecastle I went foreward and saw the
brandishing and open Razor and swore that
he would cut any person who interfered
or came near near him using at the same
time very abusive language: the prisoner
asked me to take him away or he should
hurt him I could not say whether the
prisoner had or had not a Knife in his hand
I went and reported to Captain Maxwell that,
the men were quarreling the Captain then
came foreward and went into the forecastle
Witness and Carpenter Benjamin Rees
followed the deceased had been stabbed but
was still brandishing the Razor as before
Captain and Witness endeavored to take the
Razor from him and suppress the quarrel,
the Carpenter Benjamin Rees then took

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.40015-2"/>

the Razor from the deceased, we then laid
him down, the Captain sent for the Doctor
of Steamer "Zaire" then Coaling from us, I
asked the prisoner if he was sorry for what
he did, he replied no and would do it again
dam him let him die like a dog and I
will hang like a man, Witness said you
have done this under the influence of Liquor
and tomorrow you will be sorry for it
prisoner, replied and said I am perfectly
sober. I have no reason to suppose any
ill feeling existed between the deceased
and prisoner previously.</p>

in the forecastle. I told the prisoner to leave
him alone as he was in liquor, seeing the
Captain and mate went foreward, I also
followed I then saw the deceased with a
Razor in his hand, and also noticed that
he had been stabbed I forced the Razor
out of the decased hand, the Captain then
sent for medical aid from the Steamer
"Zaire" then Coaling from the Ship the
Doctor announced the Stab mortal, and
within half an hour the deceased received the 
wound he died.  I do not know whether any
ill feeling existed between the prisoner and

<p>I was sitting in the forecastle
about Sun Set deceased came on board
having been in attendance on the Captain
on shore, the deceased was in liquor, he
came into the forecastle with an opened
Razor is positive that it was opened I
left my seat when he was brandishing
the Razor for fear of getting cut, prisoner
came in at the time, deceased addressing
him saying, I will cut the liver out of
you, the prisoner said go away my man I
dont want speak with you, you are in liquor
to night tomorrow morning if you
are a man I will speak with you the
deceased cut the prisoner on the thumb
he held out his hand to the deceased
and said see how you have cut me, one
of the Crew James Henry came into the
forecastle and persuaded the prisoner to
leave him in hopes the deceased would
go to sleep. Witness thinks the prisoner
remained out about half an hour, he then
came in leaning over his bunk, the deceased

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.40020-2"/>

deceased still abusing him and laid
hold of him with the Razor still opened in 
his hands prisoner said leave me alone I
dont want to have anything to do with you

prisoner then went following the deceased the
latter still holding the Razor open in his
hand, they went out by the Starboard
door and both entered the forecastle again
by the Port door the deceased continued
the same irritating abusive and threatening
language, prisoner asked John
Symonds to lend him his Knife to cut
some meat the deceased continued in
the same manner abusing and brandishing
the Razor: when the prisoner stabbed the
deceased in the left side with the Knife he
staggered to his bunk and fell; medical
assistance was immediately sent for
he survived only about half an hour, I
have no reason to suppose any ill feeling
existed between the deceased and prisoner
when the prisoner went out as before <unclear></unclear>
he came back with his knife, the knife had

<p>I was one of the Crew of the
Captain's Boat having left the Ship after
dinner and remained on there waiting
on the Captain until Sun Set when we 
went of to the Ship I was sober the others
were in liquor more particularly the
deceased who was very much intoxicated
and getting out of the boat I helped him
up the side of the Ship do not think he could
get up without help, when I came out of the 
boat after making her fast I saw the deceased
in the <sic>Gally</sic> talking with the Cook I told
him to go to the forecastle he went there
deceased then took a Razor from his
waistband and throwing both his hands
up threaten "to cut the prisoners Guts out"
prisoner told him frequently to go away

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.40022-2"/>

from him, deceased continued in the 
same threatening conduct for a quarter of 
an hour repeating the same words, but 
the razor not opened the prisoner left
the forecastle for about five minutes and
then returned deceased repeated the
threats and language which he had
before used. Prisoner asked John
Symonds to lend him his Knife to cut
a piece of meat Symonds lent it to him
prisoner  stood with this knife in his hand
telling the other to desist and go away
deceased refused but rushed towards
him with his arms extended but holding
the Razor closed in his right hand still
threatening the prisoner, he then stabbed the
deceased in the left side who reeled back
against a bunk prisoner withdrew the
knife the deceased continuing in the
same manner using abusive language
after he was stabbed. Prisoner said to
the deceased you need not fret anymore
as you have had it into you (meaning 
the knife ) the prisoner then walks out of
the forecastle said he had done it for himself 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.40023-2"/>

but could not keep it, I knew nothing 
more as I was ordered on shore by the
mate to the Consul and when I returned 
found that he had died.</p>

enquiry if Mr R Cunningham is authorised to draw
Drafts on your Department to the compensation provided
for the Agency &#38;c to which I have to reply
in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I have now to respectfully
request you to inform me whether I have been superceded
in the office of U S Coml Agent at St Paul de
Loanda. My reasons for which I trust you will
excuse as during the month of January last I received
a Letter from Mr S A Andrews of Albion. Orange
Co New York stating he had been appointed U S
Coml Agent in my stead. After some correspondence
he offered to resign the office on certain conditions to
part of which I complied. I now learn from him that
he misunderstood my purpose &#38; that he intended going 
to Africa.</p>

<p>Several months since I was in Washington 
&#38; handed a Letter to Hon <unclear>Chas Sumner</unclear> who informed

<fw><unclear/> Seward Esq<lb/>
Assistant Secretary State Department<lb/>
Washington DC</fw>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.50006-2"/>

me he would give it his attention which led me to presume
that as I had always to the best of my knowledge given satisfaction 
to the several Administrations during the time I 
held the office that as it was a place where I was well &#38; favorably
known that I would still sustain it.</p>

<p>As the only notice I have received of my Removal comes 
from Mr Andrews will you please inform me if the same is 
correct.</p>

conformity to Sections 153 and 154

the Annual General Report for the Years

<p>Commerce</p>

<p>The Greater part of the commerce of this
place is with Portgual, Untied States,
and the Brazils.</p>

<p>Imports from Portugal consisting
principally in Wines <unclear>Liver</unclear> Oil, and 
English Manufactured Goods. $250000:00
Exports, Palm, Fish, and Ground <unclear>nut</unclear>
Oil, Wax, Hides, Ivory, Copal, and Coffee $400,000.00
United States Imports Rum &#38; Provisions

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.50015-2"/>

Lumber, Powder and Cotton manufactured
goods, the importation of the latter article
having entirely fallen off these last nineteen
months, owing to the Civil War in America
causing the great advance in the price
of Cotton. $150.000.00</p>

<p>Exports Palm and Fish Oil, Coffee, Copal,
Ivory, and Ground Nuts. $250,000.</p>

<p>Brazils, Imports Rum, Sugar, &#38; Tobacco $100,000:00</p>

<p>Exports, Palm and Ground Nut Oil, Wax
and Hides. $20,000:</p>

<p>Great Britain. The principal Article
imported has been coals abouts 5000 tons
freighted in American bottoms at the
low rate of 25 and <unclear>28/0</unclear> per ton valuation
including freight laid down here is $55000</p>

<p>The great draw back 
to the Commerce of this place is the
exorbitant high duties, which is levied 
on all merchandise imported more 
particularly on American which 
according to Treaty had to pay two thirds 
(2/3) and national vessels on third (1/3) on 
an average I may safely estimate it at
35 per cent ad valorem on all merchandise
<catchwords>imported</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.50016-2"/>

imported from the United States</p> 

<p>The Currency of this Province of Angola
was formerly Fourteen hundred reis to the 
American or Spanish Dollar but in July 1861 
on the arrival of the new Governor the Currency 
was changed to the same rate as Lisbon which
is nine hundred &#38; twenty reis to the American or 
Spanish Dollar, one mil reis equal to one 
Dollar nine Quarter Cents ($1. 9 1/4)</p>

<p>The Sanitary condition of this place for
the past eighteen months has been rather
unfavorable, the yellow fever and black 
vomit having made its apperance for the
first time supposed to have been brought
from the Brazils, cases which has terminated 
fatally has been principally newcomers.</p>

<p>Before closing this I cannot let pass 
without commenting on the late affair which 
occurred in April 1861 the Imprisonment 
of the U S Naval Store Keeper Mr E A Bernie
for a trivial offence and the brutal treatment 
he received at the hands of the Authorities 
of this place.</p>

<p>To think an official in the Employ of the
U. S. Government in a foreign Port should be

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.50017-2"/>

shut up in a filthy prison for Seventy
days is shameful and contrary to 
the Treaty with Portugal, ratified in 
1840 art 10 wherein it says (and it is 
hereby declare in case of offence 
against the laws such Consul, Vice
Consul, Agent, or Commissary may 
either be punished according to law, 
or be sent back the offended Government 
assigning to the other seasons for the Same.</p>

<p>The American Squadron was on 
the Coast at the time of this occurence 
Flag Officer <unclear>Innman</unclear> demanded he
said E A Bernie but was refused
consequently E A Bernie was left to
his fate and the result of the trial was 
deportation for 2 years. I hope after 
the termination of the rebellion in
America the U S Government will
demand satisfaction from Portugal 
for so gross an insult.</p>

<p>Commercial Agency of the U. S. of America
at St Paul De Loanda December 31st 1863</p>

<p>Sir
I have the Honor to enclose Custom House
and Port Charges for the Port of St. Paul De Loanda.</p>
<p>Also Arrivals and Depatures for the Quarter
Ending, December 31st. 1863.</p>
<p>Also Official Letters and Blanks Received 
By this it will be perceived that the box with 
flags and Blanks reached here on the 24th November,
about 9 months after it left Washington.</p>
<p>Mail facilities between this Place and the U.S. 
are very slow and uncertain, By the English Mail it 
is seldom less than three and often five months between 
the mailing of a letter in New York and its receipt
here, in fact there is no regular mail except as far as
<unclear></unclear> where it lays until some English cruiser
chooses to bring it up.</p>
<p>I received the box from St Helena via Cape
of Good Hope forwarded to me by Walter Graham
Esq.</p>
<p>The Draft and voucher for stationary I hope
will prove satisfactory.</p>
<p>I have also the Honor of enclosing a tabular
Statement of export Duties and Other Charges 
for this Port. Also Aggregate Amt of Fees</p>
<p>I have the Honor to State that Clearing a
Vessel from Port is a perplexing operation.
<unclear>1st notice of eight things must be given,</unclear>
<unclear>2nd a Bond with two sureities (merchants)</unclear> 
in the sum of <unclear>Five</unclear> Thousand Mil <unclear>Reis</unclear>
<unclear></unclear> $2675.59 must be entered into as 
a guarantee that the vessel will not engage 
in the Slave Trade. <!--0001-->
This is well, when suspicious attacks to any vessel, but
it is exacted indiscriminately, previous to granting a
Clearance, not that there is any fear that a well known vessel
will engage in the Slave Trade, but that the merchants who
sign the bond may realize the Fee which is forty five
pound or One hundred and twenty five Dollars for
so doing;</p>
<p>The Practice is continued (I am told) in accordance
with an inference drawn from a Law of 1836 there
being no positive law to justify it;</p>
<p>The merchants established here sign the Bond for
for each other, but an American Vessel arriving here
for the first time, encounters much trouble and expense 
in consequence of said Bond.</p>
<p>She must also select a Consignee (if not previously 
consigned) which obliges her to pay a further sum of One 
hundred <unclear>Mil Ries</unclear> <unclear></unclear> or $66,66 2/3.</p>
<p>In the case of the Whaling Schooner <unclear>Glindoover</unclear>
His Excellency Gov General (Jose Baptista <unclear>Andrade</unclear>)
over-ruled the Custom House authorities in regard 
to both Bond and Consignee Thus saving her
useless expense of $338.00. She Came here for
supplies only.</p>
<p>I have not succeeded in obtaining a copy of Duties 
on Imports for this province; the present Duties are 
based upon the Tariff Law of 1842 modified for
Colonial Purposes, but I have the assurance that
on the <unclear>1st of February</unclear> next a New Tariff will be 
published, based on the Tariff on 1863, with 
Colonial Modification, which will I understand 
increase the Duties on both Imports and exports, 
I will forward it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At <unclear>Benguela</unclear> <unclear></unclear> and Loanda Duties
must be paid; All the Trading Station are free
I feel it to be my duty mention the fact that the <!--0002-->
<unclear></unclear> lighters here belonging to the Government are
nearly <unclear>valueless</unclear> being rusted through in many Places,
cargo that would sink (Coal for instance) cannot 
be transported in them safety; in fact they are
not well adapted to this navigation, either in model
or material, Lighters for this harbor should be of 
wood forty five to fifty feet long and Coppered, 
the model such as are used at <unclear>Hauve de Graceon</unclear>
very strong, Cheap, light draft of water, <unclear></unclear>
easily managed, and will sail well, when sail is 
put upon them; I have no doubt, such Lighters
could be sent here all ports previously fitted and
put together here, for one thousand Dollars each.
Iam informed that freight alone on one of those
Lighters now here amounted to twelve hundred Dollars
and their term of service has been very short</p>
<p>For two years last port, trade with the interior
has much been obstructed in consequence of A War
between the Portuguese and the King <unclear>(Yaga)</unclear> of 
Cassange, one of the most powerful Potentates
of the Interior of Africa, and whose dominions border
upon the Portuguese possessions, On the 29th of August 
last, a treaty of Peace was entered into between the 
belligerents, the <unclear>yaga of Cassange</unclear> agreeing to pay
the whole expense of the war, on the 26th of September,
the Embassador of the yaga was received at the
Palace of the Government General when the Treaty 
was ratified; in consequence it is expected that 
trade with the Interior will revive and Importations 
increase.</p>
<p>Our own unhappy civil war has a very 
depressing effect upon American Trade here in
consequence of the high price of Cotton heretofore
the most profitable article of American manufacture <!--0003-->
imported into this Country also an important auxiliary
to all other article of sale or barter under present circumstances
the English (who have only one house here)
sell gotten goods for at least 30 per cent less than
the same article can be bought in the U. States.</p>
<p>With despatch No 5 I had the Honor to mention 
the fact of the loss of my commission and Passport,
I have not been able to recover them, and am under the
necessity of renewing the request that others he
sent to me, nor have I received the necessary exequetor
requested in the house of the same Despatch.</p>
<p>I also had the honor to mention the fact that
the Salary of Agent at this station is inadequate
to its proper support, one must live as do Representatives
of other Countries or lower his own 
Country in the estimation of the authorities, which
I am not willing to do, luxury  is not requisite,
but respectability is.</p>
<p>I am aware that Congress must concur in
whatever is done in the premises, but a recommendation
from your Honor to the Proper authorities,
together with the concurrence of the representative
from my congressional district (the Hon. <unclear>E. H. Webster</unclear>)
I feel Confident would procure an increase of 
Salary, in default I would respectfully solicit 
the appointment of Naval storekeeper here, or the appointment
to some situation where the salary is
adequate to support the station without engaging
in Commercial pursuits.</p>

<p>I enclose the Oath 
of Allegiance sworn to before

<p>I was born in Brazil, 
of American parentage, in 1830; 
and arrived in the State of

three years where I have resided
ever since, excepting the time
my business has called me to

papers bear date of Salem Mass 
November 5th 1851.</p>
<p>I was appointed 
from the State of Massachusetts.
I never was in Portugal, but 
I have resided in this Province 
of Angola since 1852.</p>
<p>A previous engagement 
forces me to visit England in

<p>Sir,
I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of Your despatches of May 13 &#38;14th 
one requesting me to "continue to act as U. S. 
Commercial Agent for this Post," the one informing
me that the President had appointed
Mr <unclear>A A Silva</unclear> as Com Agent.</p>
<p>Mr Silva not having signed any
Bonds, nor taken the oath &#38; also not having 
yet received his Commission, the Portuguese 
Authorities here could not recognise 
him as U S C Agent. Neither do they <unclear>account</unclear>
me as such but allow me to act as far as 
may be necessary in respect to the wants of 
American Vessels arriving at this port &#38; to 
keep charge of the Archives, seal, flags &#38;c</p>
<p>I now enclose the Returns from the 
Agency from Jany 1st to June 30th 1864. My 
reason for not doing so previous was that as 
Mr. Bradberry had died without approving 
one to act for him. I was uncertain whether 
I had authority to make out the Returns but
since the receipt of Your despatch of May 13th <!--0009-->
I have given it my attention as per the enclosed.
The several accounts &#38; certificates I have directed 
to the Treasury Department &#38; have drawn on 
the Hon Secretary of the Treasury two Bills-
one for $84.16 &#162; the other for $247.00 being 
balance of Salary for the Quarter ending March 
31 &#38; June 30th 1864.</p>
<p>At the time Mr Bradberry died he was 
in debt to several persons here, but they do 
not expect to receive anything from his Estate.
I enclose to the 5th auditor an account current 
with vouchers showing that my demands 
amount to <unclear>RS 300$975</unclear> in this currency, or in U. S.
Coin $201.32&#162; With the exception of my 
private a/c <unclear>RS 127$625</unclear> the next is for Cash paid 
by me for his Medical Attendance &#38; Burial Expenses.
I have drawn on the Hon. Secretary of 
the Treasury for the Balance due Mr Bradberry 
at the time of his death $142.75 informing 
the Hon. Secretary of these circumstances &#38; trust 
that as this was for money expended in such 
a manner that the Draft will be duly honored.</p>
<p>Mr Bradberry in the Month of January 
last received $29.92&#162; Balance Wages &#38; $31.91&#162; 
Extra Wages on account of a Colored Seaman named  <!--0010-->
George Frank who was shipped in England on 
board the American Ship "Cumberland" &#38; was discharged 
here on account of sickness- By the Relief 
<unclear>Book</unclear> I notice he had paid on a/c $3.93&#162; &#38; I 
was not authorised to pay the balance of this 
amount to Geo. Frank who was a West Indian,
the English Counsul took him in charge &#38; sent 
him on board an English Vessel. I gave the 
English Consul notes of the a/c &#38; presume Your 
Honor has been notified of the same by the English 
Government.</p>
<p>In taking charge of Mr Bradberry effects 
not one cent was found in money &#38; I presume 
the money he received from Geo. Frank was 
remitted to Mr Bradberry family by a vessel 
that left this in January bound for Boston 
Mass- Mr B calculating of course to make it 
up from the sale of his draft for the Quarter
ending March 31, 1864. </p>
<p>Circular No 44 is received &#38; in reply
will inform the Department that Commercial 
agents as such, are not required to pay taxes
in this port.  Circulars No 45 &#38; 46 are also recieved.
No vessel hailing from the Insurgent 
States has made their appearance in this <!--0011-->
port, neither is there anything shipped 
from here to those states.</p>
<p>There has been only one American 
Merchant vessel arrived at this Port 
during the Quarter ending June 30th- the 
cause of which is the high prices of 
Cotton Gords Rum, Powder, &#38;c in the States- 
these being the principal articles formerly 
imported here. Two or three years since 
<unclear>we used</unclear> to have 8 or 10 vessels engaged 
in this Trade, but it has finally become 
reduced to this deplorable <unclear>extent</unclear>. The 
Merchants here &#38; on the Coast, who used 
to be very prompt in payment are now 
very backward, casued by Wars in the 
interior, overshadowing &#38; undertaking more 
than they can carry out- a few merchants 
of old standing continue to keep their 
credit good, but they do nothing near the 
amount of Business now that they need 
do.  Loanda &#38; all <sic>allong</sic> this Coast has 
suffered severely from the Small Pox 
which first made its appearance in 
February last about 70 miles North of this 
at a place called Kisembo. It is estimated <!--0012-->
that 4000 natives have died from its effects 
on Loanda alone. Very few Whites have 
been attacked yet with it.  It is said to be 
decreasing.</p>
<p>Mr Brookhouse of Salem Mass, the 
largest American Trader of this Coast has concluded 
to close his Business here Messers <unclear>Robson</unclear>
<unclear>Ridsent</unclear> &#38; Roberts of Boston are left, but
from present appearances they will not send 
another vessel till the prospect is more promising.</p>
<p>The Mails from the States to this port 
are very irregular- for a four years past there 
has been a Line of Steamers from Lisbon to 
this Coast, but they are now discontinued- 
the Portuguese Government are endeavoring 
to get up another Line. The Mails via 
<unclear>"Fernando Po"</unclear> are brought here by the English 
vessels of War but no certainty can be placed 
on their arrival.</p>
<p>It is my intention to leave this for the 
States in the couse of two months. I understand 
Mr. Silva intends leaving for England 
about the same time, with the intention of 
again returning here. On my departure 
I shall place the Archives &#38;c in charge of 
Mr. Silva if here is here, but should he leave 
before me, or if we leave at same time time, I 
shall then deliver the property of the United 
States now under my charge to the care of 
Mr. <unclear>F A Silva </unclear>, Brother of the appointed U. S. 
Commercial Agent.</p>
<p>John W Goodridge of Salem Mass, late
Master of the Brig "Morning Light" died at 
sea on board that Vessel on the 5th inst of 
Small Pox &#38; was buried at Loanda on the 
7th inst.</p>

<p>Sir,
I had the honor on the 15th 
of August last to acknowledge the 
reception of your despatch No 1 informing
me that the President 
had appointed me Commercial Agent
of the United States at this 
city. In the same despatch I 
replied to several questions requiring
answers.</p>
<p>On the 7th ultimo I received 
a communication dated July 6th 1864 
fom the Hon James E Harvey the 
United States Minister resident at
Lisbon, enclosing <unclear></unclear> my Certificate
of Appointment with authority of the 
Portuguese Majesty's government to act
in that capacity.</p>
<p>In consequence of a 
temporary interruption of steam 
communication between the Province 
and Portugal the Governor
General has not for the past five <!--10006-2-->
months received any any official communication 
from his government consequently a separate official notice 
of my appointment has not arrived 
yet without which he cannot formally 
recognize me.- A mail 
steamer is momentarily expected here.</p>
<p>I have this day presented 
to John G. Willis Esq the 
Acting Commercial Agent, the 
official order of the Department 
dated May 14th 1864 for for him to 
deliver to me the Records and, 
Archives of the Commercial Agency 
together with the Seal Press Flag
arms statutes at large and other 
property of the United States which 
order was promptly complied with 
and I herewith enclose a certificate 
copy of the Inventory.  <unclear>Wharton's</unclear>
<unclear>Digest</unclear> has never been received at 
this commercial Agency.</p>

<p>I mentioned to you 
in my despatch No 1 my <unclear>intentions</unclear> <!--10007-2-->
to visit Europe in 
a few weeks, <unclear>in consequence</unclear> of a 
previous mercantile engagement,
entered into previous to my
having any knowledge of my 
appointment as Commercial 
Agent. I regret to say the
importances of this engagement 
forces me to carry it out and 
I hope the Department will 
wish this involuntary departure 
from my port of duty an exception 
to Circular of Department
of State no 46 on file at this 
office.</p>
<p>I shall leave for England
early in December next 
my absence will only be of four
months duration during which 
time the office will be represented
as Acting Commercial Agent 
by my brother Frederic A 
Silva a native citizen of the 
United States well qualified for 
the duties that will devolve upon
him. I notice that the 
Agency requires an additional 
supply of blank No 44, 14, <hi rend="underline">8</hi> 142
143, 144, 130. Some of which are entirely
out.</p>
<p>I notice also there has 
been great difficulty in forwarding 
packages from the Department 
to this Agency. The best may 
would be to <unclear>adding</unclear> to the <unclear>care</unclear> 
of <unclear>Messer Robert F Cannon</unclear> <unclear></unclear>
<unclear></unclear><unclear>Vincent Stuart</unclear> Glasgow
Scotland and they will <unclear>forward</unclear>
to me by one of their 
vessels.</p>

Agent has not been received

<p>Sir
On the 20th ultimo the 
Portuguese War Steamer <unclear>Mendello</unclear> 
arrived here from Lisbon with 
authority from Her Portuguese 
Majestys Government to the 
Governor General of this Province 
to recognize me as Commercial 
Agent of the United States, 
Which authority has been 
published on the official 
<sic>Baletin</sic> of this city. </p>
<p>The Commerce of this 
Province is still prostrated from 
the effects of the late epidemic 
of Small Pox. Transportation 
to and from this interior has 
not as yet been resumed causing
serious inconvenience to 
business in general. The market 
is overstocked with imported merchandise 
particularly of Dry
goods, creating serious apprehensions
to holders of them fearing 
a decline in the cotton market 
by a sudden upturn of hostilities
in the United States. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding business 
in this Province has been very 
dull-- the Pea nut crop between 
Ambriz and Congo River 
has been very large amounting 
to over Two thousand tons, double 
the amount of last years yield
should it continue to increase 
in a like proportion from year 
to year which I think will be 
this case in a very short time 
it will <unclear></unclear> the Pea Nut crop
of Sierra Leone and Gambia 
River. They are obtained here

<p>Portuguese vessels who 
trade here for the articles of 
produce not obtainable now
have been very fortunate to 
find charters for their vessels
to freight pea nuts to 
Europe.</p>

information on a claim

a balance due him of $35.50 
and not <!--symbol-->9.17.6 as represented 
by the British Consul at this

<p>The difference of amounts 
arise from not deducting one 
month's extra wages in accordance

George Frank with Vouch No 3 &#38; 4.</p>
<p>I respectfully enclose

<p>Sir
In my despatch No 43 I had the honor of informing the 
Department that an American Seaman calling himself Edward
Baxter handed himself to me, on the 24th of September, requesting
protection as a destitute seaman he responded to me that he
departed from the American Barque "Governor Carver" Captain
Charles Mason of Westport, R.I. at <unclear></unclear> Little Fish Bay
for <unclear></unclear> that said Barque had taken in at that place slaves
and that he assisted taking on board the first <unclear>seventy five and</unclear>
returning for more ran away and after the Barque had <unclear></unclear>
<unclear></unclear> he came down to the town and made arrangements <unclear></unclear>
Service of the British Mail Steamer "Lincolnshire" and came to
this place and presented himself to me as stated I listened to 
his story with apprehension and doubt, but not wishing to show, that <!--30010-2-->
I entertained such a feeling, I<unclear></unclear> for a time with
seeming indifference, and set Baxter to work, about my house
with <unclear>some light jobs</unclear>. My anxiety to sift out the truth of this case
increased from day to day and I questioned and <unclear>cross-questioned</unclear>
him frequently on the subject with a view to <unclear>confirm said</unclear> statement
with another and I was surprised to find them always <unclear>correspond</unclear>
On one of those days, <unclear></unclear> at the house of a friend <unclear>Watson</unclear>
<unclear>Gradenburg</unclear> Esquire, H B M Commissioner for the Slave Trade 
No <unclear></unclear> promised to send Baxter to him
that he might take his desposition, with an object to compare with
the one that I should require of him when I should consider it 
proper to take a formal one before me. I sent Baxter to <unclear>Mr</unclear>
<unclear>Watson Gradenburg</unclear> and to my surprise two days after I learned  at
a late hour that Baxter had been sent on board the British 
<unclear>Brig "Elizabeth"</unclear> as a British subject and which vessel is on that
day <unclear>depart</unclear> for England <unclear>I was still under excitement</unclear> <unclear></unclear>
<unclear>of this extraordinary </unclear><unclear></unclear> Captain <unclear></unclear>
of the Portuguese <unclear>Corvette "Infanto de Soao" </unclear>  <!--30011-2-->
<unclear></unclear> and in a few words I explained to him the course of
my <unclear>dissatisfaction</unclear> and said
<unclear>he would not</unclear> imagine what motive could have <unclear>caused Mr </unclear><unclear>Gradenburg</unclear>
to not <unclear></unclear> if Baxter had been properly 
cleared by the Police Authorities, according to the local laws of 
the Province. <unclear></unclear> that though 
Commander de O's influence <unclear>Baxter was taken out of the </unclear> 
vessel by order of the police authorities for not having been 
cleared from that department and sent on board of the Portuguese
 Corvette "Infanto de Soao" Two days afterwards Baxter 
was sent to the British Consul Mr <unclear>Gradenburg</unclear> is also Consul 
<unclear></unclear> also I addressed a note to Mr <unclear></unclear> who
immediately sent Baxter to my office with a despatch and a 
certified copy of the deposition of Baxter taken before him In
the mean time, the Portuguese Government had heard of the report
made by Baxter of an embarcation of slaves in a Portuguese 
port and addressed me a note, requesting me the kindness to 
inform them fully on the subject. The following morning I <!--30012-2-->
invited three witnesses to my home and before them took the 
deposition of Baxter and the same day sent a despatch 
to the Colonial Secretary General <unclear></unclear> copies of both 
depositions. I also addressed <unclear>Mr Gradenburg</unclear> again You will 
<unclear></unclear> by inclosure No 6 that I requested of the Provincial Government
to send Baxter to <unclear></unclear> as I thought that on the <unclear>way port</unclear>
they would be better able to get at the truth of this <unclear></unclear> subject.
I recieved a <unclear>reply</unclear> in the affirmative and on the 12th ult. I sent
Baxter with a despatch on board of the Portuguese Corvette
Infanto de Soao On the 14th ult. I recieved a despatch from 
the British Consul On the 30th ult the Corvette  returned and 
on that day I received a communication from Commander de <unclear>O</unclear>
and on the 3rd inst a despatch from the acting Governor General 
both informing me that the evidence obtained at Mossamedes found
Baxter guilty of <unclear>basest</unclear> falsehood and that he had been committed
to Prison by order of the Government to be tried on 
the charge of the false <unclear></unclear> I replied on the 3 inst 
requesting copies of the deposition taken at Mossamedes in <!--30013-2-->
the meantime Baxter was brought up before the provincial 
authorities for indictment when he confessed voluntarily that 
everything he had said was false and a <unclear></unclear>
I was officially informed of this fact on the 9th inst, enclosing 
me a certified copy of the confession taken before the Chief 
Justice of the City in open court. His Excellency in reply to my 
despatch (enclosed No <unclear></unclear>) regretted that the original desposition 
taken at Mossamedes had been sent to the Judicial Authorities
to enable them to find a bill of indictment against Baxter 
which prevented him sending me copies at present adding
that they were very voluminous and not of much importance 
after the declaration of falsehood made by him. I was satisfied 
that the evidence was quite sufficient and on the 11th inst. I 
addressed a note to the President of the Government Council 
expressing my approval in complimentary terms on the favorable 
termination of this case which at one time indicated serious
alarm, on the probable revival of the slave trade in the American
vessels and in Portuguese <unclear>water</unclear> on the 20th instant I addressed <!--30014-2-->
a note of congratulations  and thanks to Commander <unclear></unclear>
of the Portuguese Corvette<unclear>Infanto de Soao</unclear> and also to <unclear>Fernando</unclear>
<unclear></unclear> Governor of Mossamedes I also wrote on the same 
date to Charles Mason, Master of the Barque "Governor Carver"
requesting him when he visited Mossamedes to call at this port
Throughout the case a spirited correspondence had been carried on 
between the British Consul and the President of the Government 
Council, on account of the Authorities having taken Baxter 
from on board the Brig "Elizabeth" and question their authority 
to do so, alleging that they interfered with his Consular functions. 
The Government has endeavoured to convince him that they acted in 
accordance with the local laws of this Province. The President 
of the Government Council told me he had <unclear></unclear> him for 
not regarding <unclear></unclear> or more persons <unclear></unclear> the responsibility 
which the accusation of Baxter inflcited upon the reputation of 
Portugal and the United States and without entertaining the 
least consideration would have sent Baxter to the Foreign 
Office in England and thereby comprimise the Provincial <!--30015-2-->
Government and the Commercial Agency of the United States 
The Provincial Government has also been informed by the 
British Consul that Baxter was a British subject and 
prepared to have delivered him over to me as a <unclear>deserter</unclear> from an 
American Barque. The Department <unclear>will above by the</unclear>
<unclear>several</unclear>deportations that Baxter declared himself, my oath, 
to be an American naturalized citizen.  In his confession 
which can be taken as a "bona fide" evidence he <unclear>further</unclear> 
declared that he as a naturalized citizen of the United States 
He claimed protection at that Commercial Agency when he 
could have applied to the British <unclear>Consulate</unclear> and being also 
a deserter from the American Barque "Governor Carver" I felt 
fully authorized with all these facts to send upon him my 
Consular authority. By enclosure No <unclear>1</unclear> you will perceive that 
I expressed my <unclear>surprise</unclear> to the British Consul at his attempting 
to send Baxter to England when he had no <unclear></unclear> to
suppose that I had done with him. Baxter was commanded 
to himself to the Foreign Office on his arrival on  <!--30016-2-->
England, to be there questioned on the subject and the 
consequences of such a step without the possibility of contra-evidence 
should have been extremely serious. He offered me 
an apology for acting thus alleging that he supposed I 
had done with him but which I had never thought a 
justifiable excess; Nevertheless I considered it proper to 
let the subject stop with him, after this apology.</p>

<p>You will perceive by the <unclear></unclear> 
that I have enclosed to do <unclear></unclear> upon me 
and throughout the proceedings have been anxious to discover if
the abominable traffic of slave trade had been revived in
American vessels which since the capital punishment of 
<unclear>Captain Gordon</unclear> by the United States Government I have 
not heard of a single shipment of slaves, from this part of the 
Coast and which previous to that event was almost <unclear></unclear>
<unclear></unclear> most disgracefully under the American Flag. 
I learn from the President of the Government <unclear></unclear> that 
Baxter's trial will soon take place I was surprised to have <!--30017-2-->
him say that the penalty applicable to him by the Criminal 
laws of Portugal is very slight and very probably he will only 
receive a reprimand and be put at liberty. Should this take place 
I shall order him back to Prison, and keep him there four 
months for desertion, unless claimed in the meantime by 
the Master of the Barque "Governor Carver" I never met 
in all my life a more <unclear>curt and consumate rouge</unclear> than the 
said Edward Baxter <unclear></unclear> regardless of himself and 
his Creator<unclear> as to make several false </unclear><unclear></unclear> only to <unclear></unclear>
Captain Mason of the "Governor Carver" who he himself 
has wronged by receiving advanced <unclear>money</unclear> at St Helena  
and in a few days afterwards deserted at Mossamedes.</p>
<p>I would do an act of injustice if I closed this 
despatch without mentioning in an honorable manner, the 
able, prompt and willing cooperation, I received from the 
Government in assisting me to <unclear></unclear> the truth of Baxter's 
representation and it is worthy of commendable honor to the 
Authorities here to note the indignation which the story of 
Baxter <unclear></unclear> when their national honor was <!--30018-2-->
in danger of being stigmatized with the revival of the slave 
trade in their waters.</p>

<p>Sir;
In accordance with the request contained 
in your despatch of Today's date, I have the 
honor to send to your Office the Seaman Edward
Baxter, who left the American Barque "Governor 
Carver" at Mossamedes on the ground, as he 
alleges, that she was engaged in the slave trade.</p>
<p>When Baxter by your desire presented 
himself to me, a few days ago, I was under 
the impression that you had satisfied yourself 
that he was a British subject and intended to 
place him at my disposal with a view to 
my receiving his desposition. If I misunderstood 
your intentions and object you will I 
hope accept the above explanation, as an excuse.</p>
<p>I enclose the declaration made 
by Baxter before me to enable you to ascertain 
whether the circumstances that he may relate to 
you <unclear>coincide</unclear> with these that he told to me, 
and you are at liberty if you think proper to 
take and use a copy of this statement.</p>

<p>I Edward Baxter, a native of Liverpool, 
twenty-five years of age, do solemnly declare, and 
state as follows-</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, I shipped 
at St Helena my board the Barque "Governor 
Carver" belonging to Westport United States of 
America, of which vessel, Charles Mason, a 
native of Nantucket, is master. The first port
at which the ship <unclear>reached</unclear> after leaving St Helena 
was Little Fish Bay, the arrival there <unclear></unclear> 
Friday afternoon about three weeks ago. At about 
<unclear></unclear> OClock that night, four boats in one of 
which I was employed, was sent ashore to the 
North Point of the Bay and there embarked seventy 
<unclear>five</unclear> Blacks, where they <unclear>conveyed</unclear> on board. The boats 
were then sent a second time to the same place, 
and as I was afraid of what they were doing, I 
ran away in the dark, as I shipped to go 
on a whaling voyage, and not to <unclear></unclear> slaves I <!--30024-2-->
cannot say what number of Blacks, they took the 
second time. The ship was fitted not like a 
whale but when we were three days out from 
St Helena  I saw Sperm whales all round the ship 
and said to the second Mate "how is it we are not
lowering after those whales." "Oh", said he, "we are 
not after this kind of whales," I then asked him 
what kind of whales we were after: he answered 
"we are after two or three hundred Black birds if 
we can catch them. Then the fourth day they lifted 
out the bodies-- The Americans call them <unclear>"Tripods"</unclear>
and there was a kind of Bulk head- They knocked 
the bulkhead away and I saw an iron rod
nailed down to the deck, with <unclear>footcuffs</unclear> a sort of
handcuffs on the feet. Then the Captain
said Boatswain do you know what these things 
are for "then this is where we shall put the first 
seventy niggers we get" and it was there they put <!--30025-2-->
the seventy-five they brought on board that Friday
night. After leaving the boat, I remained all 
night in the mountains, the Barque went away 
the following morning, steering towards the north.
I then went down into the town, and saw the Captain 
of the schooner "Lincolnshire" whom I asked to 
give me a passage to Loanda; He told me to 
help to get the Bullocks on board, and then 
to go on board myself,  I did so, and arrived 
at this port on the 24th of September.</p>

I have the honor to acknowledge the

<p>Sir;
Having returned from Mossamedes where I 
converged the United States Citizen Edward Baxter for the 
purpose of ascertaining the truth of a statement made by 
him of a shipment of slaves having been affected on the 
Bay of Mossamedes I have to inform you that the 
Governor of that district co-operating with me enclosed 
with a minute inquiry in <unclear></unclear> of several persons and 
of Edward Baxter himself without sharing any 
effort that might tend to the discovery of the truth.</p>
<p>From the results of there investigation which 
were now submitted to the Hon Consul of Government 
to become evident that the statement is a false one.</p>
<p>Said Edward Baxter whereby contradicts 
his statements in various instances and proves from his 
own <unclear></unclear> the falsity of several points set forth in
his statement. The fact that becomes evident is 
that whether from not agreeing with the Captain
of the Barque "Governor Carver" or because he may 
have been punished for his misconduct and deserted 
the vessel remaining some days in the neighborhood 
of the town eating and sleeping in different houses 
whose owners he afterwards pointed out as being 
in conspiracy with the Captain of the vessel at the 
time of shipping the slaves and to whom he had 
said that it was <unclear>easier to cut his throat</unclear> than to return on board the ship he had deserted for the 
reason that he was on very bad terms with the Captain,
and it was only after the vessel had sailed that he 
went to the town where he slept one night.</p>
<p>Whether in revenge to the Captain or from 
any other bad feeling, the said Edward Baxter 
has made a fake statement involving not only 
the authorities, but also several individuals some of 
which have been determined and are now awaiting 
their trial, that here to be instituted for having 
been pointed out by him as having assisted the 
Captain in shipping the slaves as he had 
related.</p>

<p>Sir
The Consul of Government acting as Governor 
General of this Province has much pleasure in informing
you that from this inquiries instituted at Mossamedes 
by the Governor of that district, it has been most 
authentically proud that the accusation of the 
seaman Edward Baxter of the American Barque 
"Governor Carver" alluded to in your despatch of 
the 10th October, is a false one.</p>
<p>The accusation is of the gravest 
character, affirming that a shipment of slaves 
had been affected close to that town. Said 
seaman is therefore a Prisoner according to 
our Criminal Code of Laws and will consequently 
be tried and punished for which purpose he 
is already in Jail.</p>
<p>The Council of Government has to thank you <!--40025-2-->
for your services is producing said seaman thus 
facilitating this discovery of the truth, alike important 
to the Portuguese Nation and the United States of 
America; But now will yet render greater 
service, if you should arrange in such a way 
as to cause said Barque to come to this Port, at 
an early date, by addressing through the Governor 
of that place, an order to all American Whalers 
calling them, in order that notice may be 
conveyed to her, so as to identify the seaman.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch
of yesterday's date wherein I am informed that 
the despositions of the American Seaman, Edward Baxter,
taken at Mossamedes proved by authenticated evidence that 
the accusation made by him against the people of that place 
and the character of the American Barque "Governor 
Carver" was false.</p>
<p>Reserving my comments on this subject, for a 
subsequent opportunity. I have only to remind your 
Excellency, that I claim the right, to respectfully 
request of you, the kindness to punish and at your 
earliest convenience with copies of all the depositions 
taken at Mossamedes by the Authorities of that place, <!--40027-2-->
that I may to <unclear>enable not only to copies to you my views</unclear>

to understand that this Agency does not approve of the 
manner in which Edward Baxter has slandered 
the honor of Portugal on Portuguese Territory but it 
reserves for self the right to throughly investigate the 
case on the part of the United States Government in

<p>Sir, 
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt 
of your despatch of the 3rd inst, in which you request 
copies of the deportation taken at Mossamedes 
to the supposed shipment of slaves in the proximity 
of that town, as stated in this city by the seaman 
Edward Baxter, a naturalized American.</p>
<p>In answer I have to inform 
you that <unclear>these docts</unclear> are four in number and very 
voluminous that at the time you asked for them
the originals had already been sent to the respective
Judge, for him, within 8 days, to pronounce verdict 
upon the charge brought against that seaman for 
false statement- This has now been done and 
intimated to the culprit in accordance with the 
Commercial Treaty between the United States of 
America and Portugal that in the mean time 
said seaman has withdrawn his former statements, as
false and in public audience as is shown from
the enclosed desposition, which I have the honor 
to hand you.</p>
<p>I believe this document will dispense 
with those requested in your said despatch, which
clearly proves the falsity of the accusation. This is 
more than proved by his spontaneous and voluntary 
confession. </p>
<p>Nevertheless if you still consider them 
indespensible they will be sent to you, as soon 
as copies can be taken by the Court.</p>

that he had  never been in prison before- being
further questioned by the judge as to his nationality 
he answered that he was an American Citizen 
having been naturalized as such about one year

interpreter said that the accusation made by him 
both to the American and British Consul and 
to the Government of this Province, of a shipment 
of slaves made in the Bay of Mossamedes on board 
the American Barque "Governor Carver" was 
false and that he declared <unclear></unclear>to be such to the

for what purpose he had made such a statement , 
He replied, that having deserted the said Barque, 
and fearing future punishment he had invented

hopes of obtaining a passage gratis to England 
and it was with those views that on his arrival

I have the honor to request of you the kindness 
to deliver the enclosed letter to Captain Clark Mason 
of the American Barque "Governor Carver", when
his vessel enters your port and who I understand, 
is <sic>cruizing</sic> off your Coast.</p>
<p>This recent unfortunate circumstance
connected with the false accusation made by Edward

yourself to have your character defamed by 
the bare accusation of having the slave trade revived
at your very door more especially at a 
time when it had become a fixed fact that for so
many years no instance of this nefarious nature 
has been recorded but on the contrary, your 
district has flourished by irreversed Commercial 
and agricultural prosperity, to the great admiration 
of all interested in the welfare of Angola.</p>
<p>I have already exchanged congratulations 
with the <unclear>Govt Consulho de Governo</unclear> for the 
happy termination of this disagreeable case; I 
also expressed to them my thanks for this cordial

<p>Sir; 
On the 24th of September, Edward Baxter, styling 
himself as American Seaman, presented himself to this 
Commercial Agency for protection, and on oath, before 
witnesses declared that, he ran away from your vessel 
at Little Fish Bay, for the reason that you had 
shipped, at that place, a cargo of slaves. </p>
<p>This report, very naturally created 
much excitement and anxiety with the Local Portuguese 
Authorities and myself, who proceeded at once to investigate 
the truth. Baxter was examined by the 
Authorities of this place and by the British Consul 
also and at my request was sent to Little Fish Bay 
on board of the Portuguese Corvette "Infanto de Soao"
which vessel left here October 12th and reformed on the <!--50004-->
30th of the same month, on which day , I received a 
communication from the Commander, informing me 
that Baxter failed to prove on the alleged <unclear>suit</unclear> the 
accusation he had made against your vessel and the 
inhabitants of that industrious village. Baxter was 
then, by order of the Portuguese Government, imprisoned.
A few days after he was brought before the Judicial 
Tribunal of this City and indicted with the charge
of having made false accusation and ordered again 
to prison, to await his trial. Baxter, before the
court, became alarmed and to a Portuguese gentleman 
he confessed that everything he had said was false 
and a pure invention of his own.  He was brought 
again before the Judge and made a formal confession 
of which I have the honor to enclose a copy. Baxter 
is still in Prison waiting his trial. The acting 
Governor General told me a few days ago that 
the penalty of his crime, by the criminal laws of 
Portgual was very light and that he would only be 
reprimanded and set at Liberty. As soon as 
this takes place, I shall order Baxter back to 
Prison and there confine him four months, on the 
charge of having deserted your vessel and I hope, 
in the meantime, you will come to Loanda to 
claim him. Your presence here will also do 
much good. I have been requested by the Governor 
General of this Province to invite you to 
visit this Port.</p>

Portuguese authorities to await 
his trial, the trial being <!--50008-->
delayed I requested several 
times the judicial authorities 
to have the case decided 
which took place on the 26th 
isn't the trial was a short 
one his own confession proving 
him guilty of the charge 
against him. The judge applied 
to his case the most
lenient version of the law, deciding 
that the imprisonment 
he had already suffered was 
the punishment they should 
impose upon him. He was therefore 
set out at liberty and 
presented himself to me.</p>
<p>I am concious 
of its being my duty to inflict <!--50009-->
upon him an additional 
punishment for deserting the 
American Bark "Governor Carver"; 
isn't seeing him very much 
reduced by bodily weakness from 
the hardship of a Portuguese 
prison in Africa which he 
suffered for nearly five months, 
when he had been seriously 
sick with fever on two occasions 
humanity directed me to allow 
him to be at liberty to 
recruit his health which being 
accomplished I should cause
him to suffer a moderate 
imprisonment that he may 
have impressed upon him the 
consequences of deserting an <!--50010-->
American vessel in a foreign 
port without justifiable reason.</p>

I have the honor to 
acknowledge reception of your 
Despatches Nos 10 11 and 12 respectively-
In reply to your Despatch 
No 11 I was pleased to learn the 
satisfaction of the Department 
with my proceedings in the Case 
of Baxter.</p>
<p>I regret that I should 
have drawn a wrong impression 
by intimating that I should 
cause Baxter to be rearrested 
for deserting American Bark 
"Governor Carver" I was acting <!--R50001--> 
in conformity with the Eleventh 
article of the Treaty between 
Portugal and the United States 
and with the supposition that 
the said vessel would return to 
Loanda to claim him.</p>
<p>It fortunately happens 
from the prolonged physical 
weakness of Baxter I did not 
carry-out the views expressed 
to the Department. Baxter is 
waiting for an opportunity to 
leave the Country. He still 
continues out of health.</p>

<p>Sir, 
I have the honor to inform the 
Department that on the 22nd ultimo 
I visited the British Flag Ship
"Bristol" to resent my respect to 
Commodore Hornby who received 
me with cordial attention and 
saluted me with seven Guns on my 
depature. In consequence of information 
received from the British 
Consul some time since that 
the rank of Commercial Agent was
not known in the British Navy. I 
announced myself on board as United 
States Consul. The Next day 
Commodore Hornby returned my <!--R50003-->
visit and referring to the subject 
he confirmed the British Consul's
statement and further added if 
I had sent him my card as 
Commercial Agent he would not 
have known how to act and most 
assuredly would not have saluted 
me.  The Department will please 
note that I am not in the habit of 
seeking salutes as this was my first 
nearly two years in office, I felt it
my duty to make this visit especially 
as this is the third British Commodore 
who has visisted this port since 
my appointment as Commercial Agent.
The Commanders of British Vessels 
of War have been very kind to
American Merchants established along <!--R50004-->
this coast and not long since 
H M Steam Tender Pioneer, landed
at Ambrizette, Forty Armed Men 
and protected the Trading Factory 
of Mr Harvy Wickes (of New York State) 
for six days from destruction by 
the natives the "palana" was subsequently 
settled and Mr Wickes lives 
peaceably among them.</p>
<p>The object of this Despatch is to 
show  the Department the unpleasant 
situation of Commercial Agents when 
they come in contact with foreign 
vessels of War more especially the 
Commercial Agency of St Paul de 
Loanda, which from its Commercial
importance, and locality frequently  <!--R50005-->
visited by the squadrons of 
England, France, and Portugal; 
and together from the fact, England 
and Brazil support full Consuls 
here, I am in hope the Department 
will consider the expedency of 
creating the agency to a Consulate 
and thus avert the possibility of 
it's official character being 
misunderstood. </p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to inform the 
Department that since my Despatch 
No 25 the board ordered by 
the Navy department composed 
of three officers of the U. S. Store 
Ship "Purveyor" has established 
at this city a Naval Store house  
for the use of the U. S. Vessels of 
War. </p>
<p>On their arrival here they 
applied officially to me for 
assistance which was cheerfully offered <!--R50007-->
them, with I am pleased to say 
favorable results.</p>
<p>Being familiar with 
the inconvenience which the former 
United States Store Keeper had to 
contend with I lost no time to 
request His Excellency to allow me 
the privilege to suggest a plan 
more simple than the former and equally
as sequre to the Portuguese Government. 
His Excellency requested 
an interview with me for explanation, 
which resulted in his acquiescence 
to all my views.</p>
<p>I suggested the privilege 
to allow the United States Naval 
Store Keeper on the Arrival of every 
Store Ship to deport at the Custom <!--R50008-->
House a duplicate copy of her cargo, 
and  to permit without Custom house 
vigilance the Ship to discharge said 
cargo with the stone house.</p>
<p>The duplicate Invoice 
would answer as a correct voucher for 
all stores that entered the store house 
and as voucher for delivery each vessel 
of war should furnish the Store Keeper
a duplicate receipt for what they received 
one of which to he deposited at 
the Custom house. The Custom house 
authorities to the privilege whenever
they showed deem it necessary to 
verify the balance of Stores on hand. </p>
<p>The immediate willingness 
of His Excellency to concede to our 
request and practically carrying it out, <!--R50009-->
speak of itself the high esteem that 
distinguished official entertain toward the 
American character.</p>
<p>Leuit Commander <unclear></unclear> 
of the U. S. Store Ship "Purveyor" left 
this port highly impressed with the 
<unclear></unclear> attention he received from His Excellency 
and before his departure in a letter expressed 
his thanks to him, in very appropriate 
words, which was enclosed 
by me to him in another note joining 
Capt <unclear>Doven</unclear> in his sentiments.</p>
<p>The advantages gained
by the present concession over that concede 
to the former store house established 
here by Flag Offifcer <unclear>Irman</unclear> in 1859 
can only by appreciated by those familiar <!--R50010-->
with the vexation the former Store 
Keeper had to undergo, being as he always 
was dependant in the slow motion 
of a native Custom home guard, who 
held a second key to all the Store houses,
and even so the store house could only 
be opened in the Custom house hours.</p>
<p>His Excellency has 
always manipulated his friendliness towards 
the United States by special 
cordiality to United States Naval 
Officers when they visit him, and during 
the visit of the U. S. Ship <unclear></unclear> 
at this port, he visited, that ship 
which was quite unexpected as I 
never knew a Governor General to visit 
any grade below a Commodore. <!--R50011--></p>

been promoted to a near admiral 
since he assumed charge of the 
government.</p>

<p>Sir
The Kroomen left here by 
U. S. S. "Sacramento" have requested 
me to address you on the subject of 
their obtaining passage to their 
home in the vessel under your Command-
complying withthisdesire I would 
beg first to day a few words in 
correction of any misapprehension which 
you may be under in consequence 
of possible misrepresnetation on their 
part.</p>
<p>Those men were shipped by 
Captain Collins Commanding U.S. 
Ship "Sacramento" with the distinct 
understanding that they were to be 
discharged on arrival in this port, 
of course neither Captain Collins nor 
the Kroomen were aware of the 
extreme difficulty of returning from this <!--R50013-->
port to Monrovia, else the men in 
question would never have been Shipped.
They are now here in an almost 
destitute condition, and without work
should one of U. S. Ships arrive here 
from the European Squadron, there would 
be an opportunity of their returning to 
Monrovia, but as there is no probability 
of such arrival for some months
to come it would be an act 
of the greatest kindness and charity on 
your part toward these men should 
you feel disposed to grant them a 
passage- I believe they have 
sufficient money to supply such necessaries 
as they would consume on the 
passage; is that you would be at no 
trouble concerning their maitenance. </p>
<p>In conclusion I would beg 
leave to say that in addressing you on 
the point I have done so solely on behalf 
of the Kroomen with whose unhappy 
circumstances here I am too well 
acquainted, and by no means in an 
official capacity, nor as fulfilling a <!--R50014-->
duty to-wards them for they know 
perfectly well before being shipped 
that they would be discharged in 
this port.</p>

<p>Sir
In reply to your letter of the

to certain Kroomen to Sierra Leone, 
I beg to state although willing to 
comply with your request as therein stated 
I should not be able to do so without
provision being for their sustenance 
(regularly victualled from this ship)
during the period they are on passage 
which may probably occupy some six weeks 
and for as long a period I do not think 
I should be justified in trusting to the 
Kroomen to ritual themselves as besides 
the irregularity of so doing showed they 
seem short of provisions it would oblige 
me to supply them, and all stores on 
board being Government property I should 
have to account for them.</p> <!--R50016-->
<p>It would be also necessary 
that they showed have the means 
of keeping their persons and clothing 
clean.</p>
<p>In conclusion I would beg to 
be allowed to suggest that an official 
application be made through the 
usual channel, and as Captain <unclear></unclear>
the senior officer on this coast is 
here in H. M. S. "Eclair" I have 
no doubt that arrangements may be 
made for the passage required. </p>

give great annoyance to some of the inhabitants 
principally there of the <unclear>Bungo</unclear> neighborhood

these men. </p>

<p>Sir
I had yesterday the honor to hold
some conversation with you concerning 
certain Kroomen left here by U. S. 
Ship "Sacramento" and I then made a request 
of you which I beg leave here to 
repeat, viz to afford these Kroomen a 
passage to their home in Monrovia or 
vicinity by H. M. S. "Dromedary" if compliance 
with this desire be not inconsistent 
with the device which that read is now 
engaged in- The peculiar circumstances 
of this matter will I trust be a sufficient 
apology for asking so great a favor at your 
hands- These men, twenty-six  in number 
were shipped by Captain Napoleon Collins 
Commanding U. S. S. 'Sacramento' for service 
on board that rebel during her passage <!--R50019-->
down the coast to this port where as 
was expressly understood at the time of 
their shipment, they were to be discharged.
Upon arriving here they were accordingly 
discharged and sent on shore 
with the prospect of obtaining a passage.
home by the first U. S. Vessels which should 
come here from the European Squadron.
But no such vessel has arrived since that 
time (2nd of March) and as far as I 
can learn there is no reason for expecting 
one soon. Meanwhile the Kroomen are 
becoming nearly destitute they can find 
no work or favor from the Portuguese inhabitants 
of this city, and an official note
has been addressed to me in complaint 
of their presence in this city, and requesting 
me to make some proper disposition of them,
I am therefore compelled to appeal to you
and request a passage for them to such 
point nearest their home as may be most 
convenient for H. M. S. "Dromedary" to land 
them. </p>
<p>I deeply regret the necessity which
occasions this great demand upon you <!--R50020-->
<unclear>induced</unclear> and trust you will find it 
within your power and convenience to 
comply with my request.</p>

<p>Form No 14 for quarter ending

of American Trade, over recent quarters, 
the former years previous to the 
war, the importations from the <!--60012-->
United States to this port, were very large 
and continually on the increase 
unfortuantely our domestic difficulties 
prevented the importation 
of Cotton goods from the United 
States, on account of their high 
cost Coast traders were obliged 
to seek theirs in England, and 
thus British commerce  has increased 
to the disadvantage of American 
Previous to the war, scarcely a British 
Veseel visited this port, now there 
are seldom less than from three 
to five, in the harbour, the principal 
cotton goods imported from England 
are imitations of American fabrics 
and many qualities of American 
goods would now be preferred if 
they could compete in price with 
British Manufactures, America in 
former years, found a large market 
for produce in fact, for twenty years 
they monopolised the entire trade now 
the articles are imported in quantity <!--60013-->
from England.</p>
<p>The present trade between this 
port and Boston and New York is 
chiefly confined <unclear>to rum</unclear> which forms 
at least three quarters of every vessels 
cargo, American Rum has the preference 
as this market over that of 
any other contry. The consumption 
is about 4000 pipes per annum
About 1000 pipes are imported from the

40 to 50 cents a gallon in <unclear></unclear> in

<p>United States Commercial Agency
St Paul de Loanda 18th Nov 1864</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to inform the 
Department that on the 4th of September 
the American Ship "Wm Cummings" of 
Philadelphia, George E Miller, master; 
arrived at this port with a cargo of 
coal for the United States Naval Store 
House. On the night previous I had gone 
up the Cuanza River on a business connected
with a line of steamers I have established 
there. The water on the river having fallen 
very much while I was up there I was 
detained four days longer than I expected 
to be absent I arrived at Loanda on 
my return early on the 20th, September, when 
I was informed that the entire crew, twelve 
in number, of the said ship "Wm 
Cummings" had refused duty and in consequence <!--60019-->
now imprisoned by the Captain; 
the crew preferring to go to jail until
I would return, to lay their grievances before 
me. I heard from different persons 
that the treatment they had received on 
board was horrible in the extreme I 
at once visited them at the prison, when the
representation they made to me excited my 
empathy as well as to prompt me to 
thoroughly examine the case. I commenced 
to do so five days afterwards and the examination 
lasted through ten days.</p>
<p>The circumstances resulting 
from the examination are as follows. It 
seems the crew was shipped at Philadelphia 
on the 8th day of June last 
on the 10th of the same month proceeded 
down river in tow of two tug 
boats. The ship was six days getting 
down the Delaware During the first 
three days the crew reports that the 
chief oficer, Mr Henry Miller, brother to 
the master, struck and kicked several of 
the crew. The harsh treatment very much <!-- R60000-3-->
displeased them and they reserved 
among themselves to refuse duty until 
a promise of better treatment was given 
them. The second officer reported this 
revolution to the mate, who in turn 
reported it to the captain, who went forward. 
The evidence does not show 
that Captain Miller returned in the 
least to comply with the crew's just 
request; but did by his actions defend 
the mate by locking up the 
twelve seamen in the forecastle for 
thirty-six hours without food or water 
I cannot detect the least sign of 
mutinous conduct, on the part of the 
crew, beyond the simple refusal of 
duty, to receive a promise of better 
treatment in the future; nor can I perceive 
any justiable motive to oppress 
these unfortunate seamen, whose only 
object evidently was to defend their 
personal safety, during the contemplated 
long voyage before them. </p>
<p>Thirty six hours these men <sic>where</sic> forced <!--R60000-4-->
to suffer from hunger &#38; thirst and according 
to their representation some were 
forced to quench their parched throats 
in a deplorable manner. At the end 
of this period desperation caused them 
to burst open the forecastle door when 
the captain, mates, steward, cook and 
boy all now forward  armed, threatening 
to blow the first man's brains out that 
moved. They implored for water which 
was refused them. Without their making 
any resistance, five of them now put
in irons and the others had their 
hands tied behind them, and some 
again locked up in the forecastle. 
They in irons and tired were distributed 
some to the hatch house- cabin state 
rooms &#38;c, four or five of them were 
put into close confinement in a 
narrow closet or passage about three (3)
feet long, two and a half (2 1/2) wide and 
seven (7) high. These closets are situated 
in the house on deck at both
sides inside of which there is a little 
hatch, which when passed and the outside 
door open ventilates the hold.  On 
these occasions the hatch was closed and 
<unclear></unclear> sailor forced in and the outside 
door closed upon him. I went on board 
and examined these places and found 
them just as they had been represented 
to me: places without the least 
ventilation, Some of the crew were 
kept in these places of confinement from 
one to four hours, although the testimony 
varies as to the length of time. The 
sufferinsg of these poor creaturse msut have 
been terrible as when taken out of 
these places of confinement they would 
fall down from exhaustion. Their inhuman
persecutors even gagged one 
while confined and another was dragged 
out of his berth with a lame 
shoulder and arm, and in this state 
his arms were forced behind him and 
tied.  His groans and cries did not 
move the pity of his persecutors for an 
hour and a half. Hunger, thirst, sweat boxes
and threats forced them all to 
submit even to the huminilation of begging 
the Captain's pardon.</p>
<p>The Department will please 
observe that all these cruelties were inflicted 
within a few hours sail of 
Philadelphia and in sight of the Revenue
Cutter, which the Captain refused to 
call along side even at the joint request 
of the men. The Captain pretends 
he did not know the Revenue Cutter was 
in the vicinity, but you will observe 
by several depositions that she nevertheless 
was.</p>
<p>Captain Miller tries to represent 
that his crew mutinies but, I cannot 
see the least sign of anything 
of the sort... It was a joint refusal of 
duty, with the object to get a simple 
promise of being better treated in the 
future. The evidence of the manner in 
which the seamen were used previous 
to refusing duty, is not very clear beyond 
their own complaints, but I have <!-- R60000-7-->
a right to suppose that it was very serene 
from the brutal manner they were subsequently 
abused and on this supposition I 
think the men had a right, if not justified, 
in making a request which ought 
to have been complied with instead of 
torturing them into submission. Captain 
Miller fails to explain to me, why he 
did not return to Philadelphia- to return 
his men would have been glad to weigh 
anchor- and his refusal to seek assistance 
from the Revenue Cutter, proves his preference 
to his own way of settling such 
difficulties.</p>
<p>I have the honor to enclose 
seventeen depositions properly authenticated 
by me. The department is reading over 
some of these will feel equally as indignant 
as I did when taking the 
depositions.  The brutality of the mate 
was more excessive than the Captain , 
althouhg the latter has several very serious  
charges against him. Several of the 
crew had their heads broken by iron <!--R60000-8-->
or wooden belaying pins another with a 
hatchet, another wounded severely in the 
face, from a kick from the mate, while 
at work on the ship's side, another 
tossed overboard for 15 minutes for losing 
a scraper another severely beaten 
with a piece of wood for the slight 
offence of contradiction, others severely 
kicked in the side while at the 
wheel and other horrible brutalities 
all stated in the enclosed depositions.</p>
<p>Notwithstandiing the denial 
of the mate I am convinced of the 
truth of crew's complaint, that nearly 
the entire passage they only received 
one bucket of water per day for the use 
of twelve men, besides their tea &#38; coffee 
and meals, which of itself was a torture 
particularly as the vessel neared 
this coast and also there appears no 
cause to have justified them in 
giving this short allowance of water 
as there was plenty of water in the 
ship's tanks and much rain was caught 
during passage.</p>
<p>Captain Miller professes not 
to have his ship cleared 
for Philadelphia as he wish to sail 
on the 20th of the same month. I received 
this information on the 14th ultimo, and 
the same day Captain Miller told me that 
he intended to go to sea under protest.
I therefore lost no time in sending the 
Governor General the enclosed despatch in 
accordance with authority derived from the 
closing clause of the 28th section of the 
act of Congress approved August 18th 
1856.</p>
<p>Captain Miller complains that I 
have disabled his ship with my decision 
as he cannot proceed for want of a crew 
I told him that the responsibility was his 
not mine, for if he had respected the 
laws of his country and humanity he 
would not have placed his ship in difficulty.
He has hinted to me several times 
the certainty of judicial proceedings being 
taken against me when the ship arrives home; 
with a view to intimadate me, I nevertheless 
persist in the performance of my duty 
as I consider it aboslutely necessary that 
these unfortunate seamen showed he 
protected from further inhumanity more 
especially now as since what has occurred <!---R60000-11-->
it is reasonable to suppose that a greater 
spite would he held against them, rather 
than expect more moderate treatment. </p>
<p>The chief native which caused 
me to discharge the entire twelve men, was 
the manner, they all were treated when 
they combined to ask of the Captain a 
promise of better treatment. Captain Willer 
in his defence pretends to make out a 
care of mutiny to justify his proceedings 
notwithstanding it is clearly proved that 
at the time the crew made no resistance.
The depositions of the Captain and the Mate, 
taken last, assert that the men drew 
their knives, but from subsequent communication 
with the men I learn, they did draw 
their knives, one by one, and deliver them to 
the Captain, who the blade of each 
knife and returned the part with the 
handle. The deposition of the Captain 
and mate particularly the former have been 
consider by me with due caution and from 
whatever weak point they may with to 
fabricate a different version to the case. The 
case in general as it appears to me as 
one of a serious nature and entitled to 
special attention that a check may be put 
on inhuman ship matters the trusting to 
the aversion consuls generally have to assume 
grave responsibilities and thus escape 
without even a reprimand for their 
brutality and inhuamnity to seamen.</p>
<p>I deemed it proper to have 
the wounds of the crew examined before the 
Chief medical officer of this city who sent 
me a certificate of an authenticated translation 
of which I have the honor to enclose 
I also have the honor to enclose an extract 
from the ship's log book which 
contains an observation made with different 
Ink indicating its having been written 
at this port.</p>
<p>Captain Miller about a month 
ago represented to me verbally that he 
had no money to meet my demands, and 
if he had he should not pay it as 
such payment would deprive him of the 
privilege of proceeding against the crew for <!--R60000-13-->
mutiny. I reminded him that he would 
be obliged to pay or otherwise I should 
detain his ship. I pointed out and 
read to him several consular regulations 
and advised him to comply at 
once and proceed on his voyage to 
<unclear>Babia</unclear> for which port I could assist 
him to get a few men sufficient to 
navigate his vessel by asking them from 
a Portuguese Corvette stationed at this province. 
Captain Miller made a proposition which I at once refused to entertain, 
that he showed appoint his second mate 
matter, he and the mate go as passengers 
and me to return the crew-on board. For 
three meeks or more Captain Miller never 
again mentioned the subject or made any 
allusion to what he intended to do, notwithstanding
he frequently visited my office.</p>
<p>On the 13th inst. the British 
Bark "Sonic" under the Command of Wm 
E Woodbury, native of Gloucester, Mass;
and Charles H. Powers of Salem, Mass; as 
mate arrived here enroute for Boston  <!--R60000-14-->
from which post said vessel had 
originally sailed on this voyage.</p>
<p>On the 14th inst. I met Capt.
Woodbury and Miller under the Custom 
House shed, Captain Millers' case was 
again <sic>brough</sic> up when he suggested 
that if I would said the man on board 
he would appoint Mr Charles H Powers  
mate of the "Sonic", as master of the 
Ship "Wm Cummings". and his mate 
M Henry Miller go mat&#233; in the 
"Sonic" while he would go passenger 
in the ship. I thought the matter 
over and concluded to approve of the 
proposition in defence of the interest of 
said ship's <unclear></unclear> During the afternoon
I met Mr Powers on shower who expressed 
to me in the presence of my 
brother and Bookkeeper Mr. Beaton that 
he would like the chance very much to 
take the ship home. I made known my 
approval to Captain Miiller Woodbury 
the consented to make the exchange 
of mates. The consent of Mr Powers was then  <!--R60000-15-->
said to be required and it was not until 
the afternoon of the 16th received at 
note from Mr Powers saying that he had thought 
the matter over and concluded to remain by 
the "Sonic". </p>
<p>The sudden revulsion of consent 
leads me to suppose that my willingness to 
accede to his own proposition did not afterwards 
appear to convenient It would have 
been more gratifying to me to have this case 
brought up for trial at home than have 
Captain Miller publically defy the Consular  
regulation of the United States by refusing 
to comply with my demands. In vain have I 
told him that if I acted contrary to his 
view of the case he could pay the amount 
I demanded under protest. He refuses every 
advice and thus the ship remains in 
port to the disadvantage of her owners in 
whose interest I have been unsuccessful 
with my advice.</p>
<p>Captain Miller publicly declares 
that he will wait here until the 
arrival of an United States Vessel-of-War <!--R60000-16-->
I have been unsuccessful in convincing him 
that the presence of such a vessel would not
await him further than provide him with 
a crew as he will not be permitted to 
leave this port until he has settled with 
this Commercial Agency.</p>
<p>The twelve men have been provided 
with a boarding house on shore, and I 
am anxious for their sake to have this 
question settled that I may send them 
away as thsi is the commencement of our 
sickly season, whenever this takes place 
they will be sent if necessary to to the 
United States.</p>
<p>Under this date I address 
an official letter to Captain Miller a 
copy of which I enclose for the information 
of the Department.</p>
<p>Captain Miller has also intimated 
to me that he will remain here 
if necessary until he receives orders from 
Philadelphia before he will comply with 
my demands I reminded him that the 
responsibility of such step would rest <!--R60000-17-->
on him individually, and expressed my 
regret that his <unclear>orders</unclear> should be made 
to suffer from his own imprudence.</p>
<p>In closing this despatch 
I wish to assure the Deaprtment of my 
confidence of having performed my duty 
in accordance with the trust confided 
in me as a consular officer of the United 
States. I have been guided by the 
consular instructions in all my resolutions 
and I anticipate the approval of the 
Department and its support should 
I be prosecuted.</p>
