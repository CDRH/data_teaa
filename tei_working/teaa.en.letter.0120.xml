<p>Robert Scott Newton<lb/>
Vice Consul.<lb/>
9th April 1879.</p>

<p>Report on the Trade,
Commerce, Navigation and
Public Works at this Port
from January 1878 to March
1879.</p>

<p>Trade during the 
past year has shown considerable 
improvements over the two
preceding years although not
sufficient to renew the old 
prosperous condition. Provisions
were scarce and the natives
suffered greatly on this account 
but since the beginning of the 
present year native provisions
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.002"/>
of all descriptions abound
owing to the regular and
plentiful rains. During the 
last four months there has
fallen more rain in and 
around Loanda than has been
known for some five years
inclusive. The surrounding
county looks fresh and green
while the natives are busily
employed in planting consequently
it is not expected that there
will be any scarcity of provisions
this year.</p>

<p>One or two Firms have
stopped payment and there
still exists a general want
of confidence. Prices of all 
kinds of produce in the 
European markets have been
very low, only about equivalent
to what has been paid for it
here, thereby causing heavy losses
which still continue, to fall
on this market. </p>
<p><catchwords>As</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.003"/>
As stated above since
the beginning of the year the 
rains have been regular, and 
there is even sign that the 
present state of affairs is 
about to be changed for the 
better. The present time offers
a good opportunity for any one
desiring to open up a business
with this market, as no doubt
in a few months there will
be a great scarcity of goods
of all sorts especially Cotton
goods.</p>

<p>The following list of Cotton 
goods principally used in this 
market will be useful for
the guidance of those manufacturers
who may wish to try this market;&#8212;
Grey Domestics of heavy quality&amp; starched
each piece 30 yards by 95 inches. Selling price $2.70 per piece<lb/>

<catchwords>Blue</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.004"/>
Blue &amp; White Checks 18 yds x 25 inches. Selling price per piece $2.22.<lb/>
                            do                  18       x 31                                                  $2.93.<lb/>
Blue Baft, heavy,                      18       x 40                                                  $4.56.<lb/>
Fancy Prints, clear ground.        26       x 30                                                  $3.80.<lb/>
Morim or White Shirting            24       x 35                                                  $3.80.</p>

<p>The above are for the local 
market, and should be of
good quality. Duties are 
about 20%- on cash price. These
goods when they come from England
via Lisbon, where they are transhipped
into Portuguese vessels only pay
70% of the duties whereas if they 
come in English or American
vessels they have to pay full
duties.</p>

<p>For the barter trade.<lb/>
American stripes or Denims  18 yds x 24 inches selling price $1.20 pr price<lb/>
Checks                                  18        x 24                                $1.30.<lb/>
Blue Baft                                18        x 30                                $1.64.<lb/>
Satin Stripes                          18        x 30                                $1.64.<lb/>
Chilloes                                  17        x 27                                $1.20.<lb/>
Dark Blue Fancy Stripes        18        x 24                                $1.52.<lb/>
All these should be well starched.<lb/>
The prices quoted are for a medium
<catchwords>quality</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.005"/>
quality of goods but even a
lower quality of cloth is used
here with advantage.</p>

<p>Many qualities of Handkerchiefs
are also in use, ranging from
12 to 15 Hdkfs per piece.</p>

<p>In Cotton goods, the 
above mentiond cloth may be
considered the staple articles
of Trade.</p>

<p>I have several times
procured samples of these
goods for Captains of vessels
and Traders that have been
here in order to encourage the
Trade as I am of opinion
that American manufacturers
are quite able to compete
with the English at least in
the better qualities. Several
years ago American goods were
preferred in this market.
Particular attention should be
paid to the regularity &amp; sizes
of the pieces - One hundred (100)
<catchwords>pieces</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.006"/>
pieces is about the usual 
quantity put up in each 
bale.</p>

<p>In former years
large quantities of Molasses
Rums were shipped from
America to this Port but
of late this Colony has almost
produced sufficient for its
own consumption. There are 
large Plantations of sugar
cane at Mossamedes, Benguella,
Nova Redondo, Ambriz and in 
the Quanza River, which it is
estimated, have produced in ea: of
the last 3 years about 4500
pipes. This quality of Rum
is much preferred by the natives.
Towards the end of last year 
the cane, owing to the want
of rain, was attacked by a 
small grub, called here the 
"Rosca" and the plantations
all over the Province were 
more or less destroyed causing
<catchwords>great</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.007"/>
great loss to the planters.
The small quantity distilled
during the latter months of 
1878, sold for the high price
of Rs 90$000 to Rs 95$000 per
pipe of <unclear>130</unclear> Gall. &amp;, equal to 
$97.82 to $103.26. This year
the crop is expected to be much
better. Great care should 
be taken. by any one shipping
Rum to this part of the 
coast to see that it is of a 
clear white color, and that 
it is put into casks which
will not in any way discolor
it.</p>

<p>American flour which
also used to be shipped largely
to this Port is now thoroughly
discredited, and difficult of 
sale. This is the result of 
American merchants sending
flour of very low quality.</p>

<p>The following are the 
principal articles of produce
<catchwords>exported</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.008"/>
exported from here, vizt;&#8212;
Coffee, Palm Oil, Palm Kernels.
Way, Rubber, Pea nuts, Iron
Adansonian Fibre or Liconde,
Cotton, Orchella Weed, &amp; Gum
Copal.</p>

<p>Coffee. The quality of Angola
Coffee is any inferior &amp; realized
about the lowest price in the 
European markets. At present
it is not worth more than $45/-per 
crop in England. The total 
crop exported from here last
year was about 2500 tons. The 
quality was better than in former 
years, but owing to the low prices
ruling in Europe it is feared
the Merchants will lose heavily
on last years purchases as  the 
prices at which the coffee was
bought here were higher than the 
present European prices. If the
market does not improve the
cultivation of coffee will be greatly
reflected, as at present planters 
<catchwords>make</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.009"/>
make barely enough to cover
their working expenses. The 
heavy rains we have had this 
year have improved all the 
plantations which are now
looking green and healthy.</p>

<p>Palm Oil. Last year crop was
exceptionally small owing to the 
want of rain. This year the 
crop which is about to commence
promises to be a good and
abundant one. The price ruling
here throughout last year was
about Rs 45$000 per pipe
of 950 lbs equal to about
51/4 cents per pound.</p>

<p>Palm Kernels. The above remarks--
respecting the crop to apply 
also to palm kernels, the price
has been steady all through
the year at 500 reis per 32lbs
or say about 55 cents per 32lbs.</p>

<p>Pea nuts. This article of export
which in 1868 &amp; 1869 was equal
to 5000 tons from this port alone
<catchwords>has</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.010"/>
has dwindled down to almost
nothing owing to failure of crops
year after year from want
of rains, in fact there has been
barley enough for the natives
consumption. The prices at which 
it has been sold at for some 
few years past have ranged
as high as $2.75 per arroba, or
per 32lbs. The current price
where it was exported largely was
only 600 reis per 22 lbs. A considerable 
quantity has been planted 
this season and it may be 
expected that this year Pea nuts
will again be a staple
article of export.</p>

<p>Way. The amount gathered has 
been about the medium quantity.
The prices realized in Lisbon to 
which port all way from here
is shipped have been very low
and will show a heavy loss on
shipments. The current price 
here at present is 150 reis, or say 
<catchwords>--16</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.011"/>
16 cents per lb, formerly it
used to be 250 reis or 27 cents
per lb.</p>

<p>Rubber. The crop has been small &#8212;
The reason of this is that the
natives on collecting the Rubber 
have destroyed the greater part
of the trees in places near their
homes and have consequently
a greater distance to go to gather
fresh supplies. If they continue 
their wanton custom of destroying
the trees it is to be feared that 
this article will ere long be a 
very small item in the list
of exports. Price 29 cents per lb.</p>

<p>Ivory. The quantity brought in for
sale has been below the medium
and prices have been well sustained
$1.74 per lb being about the 
average for prime.</p>

<p>Cotton, Orchella Weed, &#8212;Gum Copal.
The quantity shipped of these 
articles has been very small
compared with former years.&#8212;
<catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.012"/>
The want of rain is the 
reason why the cotton crop
has been so small, and 
the price offered in Europe
for the Orchella weed and 
Gum copal is, I think the 
principal reason why these
articles are not shipped to as
large an extent as formerly.
When any article of produce
gets down to a low price the
natives give up growing or collecting
it as their time is not properly 
paid for.</p>

<p>Adansonian Fibre or Liconde. This is
quite a new article of export
from this port although some
years ago it was largely shipped
from the Northern ports. During
the year 1878 about 8000 Bales
were shipped from here. Owing
to the large quantity sent the 
price has fallen at home
considerably and the latest
quotation of £8.19 per ton, will
<catchwords>it</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.013"/>
it is feared prevent the 
natives from gathering it. Lately
the quantity bought has fallen
off very much. The Fibre is
the inner bark of the Baobab
tree which grows here abundantly.
The fibre is torn up into strips
and dried in the sun. Very
good ropes are made from the 
same Fibre by the natives.</p>

<p><gap/><unclear/> The prices, ruling in
March 1878 and at the 
present time for these provisions
are given beneath, vizt:-<lb/>
                                        March 1878.     March 1879.<lb/>
Farinha de Mandioca     $1.30 to $2.90   $1 to $2.20<lb/>
Milho or Indian Corn      $.90 to $1.40     $.40 to $.65<lb/>
Beans                            $.65 to $2.20     $.65 to $1.40<lb/>
<note>per arroba of 32 lbs</note></p>

<p>The greater part of the 
produce shipped from Loanda
comes from the River Quanza
some 50 to 60 miles to the South
of this, but a considerable
amount of Coffee is brought
in from the <unclear>Encofe</unclear> district a 
short distance north of Loanda
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.014"/>
the  trading port being at the 
mouth of the River Dande.</p>

<p>A line of steamers
called The Quanza River
Steam Navigation Company
runs regulary between this
and Donde a town about
180 miles up the River Quanza
making about one voyage per
week. The Company have at 
present 4 steamers; 2 of which 
are running and 2 under
repairs, they have also several
large Iron Barges for River
work. The last new steamer
built in London, draws 2 feet
of water to steam 10 knots
carrying 120 tons cargo, but she
is not exactly what is wanted
being too lightly built for towing
purposes. This is called the 
Silva Americano after the 
late consul, Mr. A. A. Silva
who was the original promoter
of this company.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.015"/>
<p>The following statement
shows the quality of Produce
brought down the River
Quanza in 1878, in the 
Quanza Company's steamers, vizt:-</p>

<p>Statement</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.016"/>
<p>The number &amp; description 
of sea going vessels entering
at Loanda during the year
1878 was as follows:<lb/>

<p>It is difficult to obtain
further particulars as to

house</p>

<p>The last American 
man of war that entered
this Port was the "Essex" in
December 1877 on her way
to the Brazils via: St. Helena</p>

<p>The Port charges are not
heavy, for vessels of over 200
<catchwords>tons</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.017"/>
tons, the amount would be 
about Rs 65,000 <note>--$70.65</note> after being
10 days in port discharging
cargo. Trading vessels 
coming to this port which
do not intend discharging 
all their cargo here, should
declare on the manifest
that they are bound to the
West Coast of Africa and
a market; and then save
great trouble and inconvenience
as should their manifest be
made out for Loanda only 
the Custom house would oblige
them to discharge the whole
of their cargo here.</p>

<p>Communication with 
Europe last year was carried 
on by two lines of steamers,
one Portuguese and one, English,
the former leave Lisbon on the 
5th of each month touching
at Madwig, St. Vincent, St. Sage,
Princes Island, St. Thoma's Island,
<catchwords>Ambriz</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0120.018"/>
Ambriz, Loanda, Bengulla
and Mossamedes while
the latter have no fixed
date of starting from Liverpool
but leave once a month and
touch at 25 to 30 ports on 
the West Coast. Since the
beginning of this year the
English line of steamers have
started from Stamberg calling
at Plimouth for mails and 
receiving the Liverpool cargo
at Bonny where they also 
transfer the homeward cargo for
Liverpool. The companies have
stuck to deposits at Bonny
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Exchange during the 
year has been at Reis 920 per dollar
or Reis 4,500 per pound sterling
The Bank rates were as 
follows:-</p>

<p>Discount for Bills at 3 months 
drawn &amp; accepted in the

<p>The following statement
shows the amount of duties

workmen sent out in 1877 to
commence a line of Railway

to the interior passing thro
the coffee districts, and for
general improvements in the
province but, for the money
spent, little or no result is 
shown beyond a single line of
telegraph from Loanda to 
Columba in the Quanza River,
a distance of 21 miles, and then
continued along the banks of the 
River for about 25 miles to a
place called Cunga. During
this rainy season the last mentioned
part of the line has been 
rendered useless on <sic>accont</sic> of
