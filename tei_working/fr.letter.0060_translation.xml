<p>
Your Eminence,

I received the two letters that Your
Imperial Highness did me the honor of
addressing to me,on the dates of January 29th and the 19th
of this month, on the subject of the armed visit
operated on the west coast of Africa
by the english warship l'alecto on the
ship the Phoenix, affected to an operation
of recruitment of blacks for our colonies.
At the time of the first of these letters
</p>

<ab>
<supplied>Your</supplied> Imperial Highness the Prince charged of the Department of
<unclear>évée</unclear> and the Colonies.
</ab>

<p>
one was arriving, I was coming from receiving
as well one from Mr. Minister of the
Navy on the same subject,  Mr. Admiral
Hamelin, in announcing to me the ulterior
commmunication of the details that were sent
to him on this affair, was asking me
to set it formerly, so that he could make
a judgment on the conduct of the delegate
and on the captain of the Phoenix, on the stretch of
coast under the jurisdiction of the
Republic of Liberia. I supposed that
my response to Mr. Minister of the Navy
would be followed by the communication that he
had forseen for me; I waited for it
in order to be capable of responding as well to the
letter from your Imperial Highness, I have not
however received anything yet. I hasten,
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_162912.jpg"/>

<p>
consequently, to transmit to your Imperial
highness a copy of what I had written
to Mr. Admiral Hamelin on the subject of the question
of Liberia, it is how she will see it, that by
the information received, either from the Minister of
Algeria and the Colonies, or from that of the Navy
that my Department could be fixed itself
on the expanse <unclear>vielle</unclear> of these limits. As for
the act of visit effected by the Alecto I am going to 
examine the circumstances and I will have care
as soon as the result of the examination has been
submitted to me, instruct your Imperial
Highness of the developments pf which this affair
will appear susceptible.
</p>

<p>
I have the honnor to be with a
respectful consideration,
Your Eminence,
</p>
