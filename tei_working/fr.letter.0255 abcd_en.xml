<p> Copy of Mr. Billinton's
Letter <unclear></unclear>
Lt. Liebrechts</p>
    
<p> Brussels the 21st of <unclear></unclear> 1887</p>
    
<p> Mr. Minister,</p>
 
<p> You have well wanted INTENDED/DELIBERATED,
in your letter from the 23 of 
this month, ce mois, m'entreteur of one 
complaint in which your Government 
had been grasped by the missionaries 
of the "American
Baptist Missionary Union"
concernany the possession 
in the<unclear></unclear> from the Congo
of their boat "Harry Reed".</p>

    <p> I hope that by some 
        explanation, to be in <unclear> meoura</unclear>
    of showing, Mr. 
    Minister, that the facts on 
    which you call to my 
    attention, souraient KNOWING even  
    less established a grief-
    fondé center my Governemtn</p>
    
 <p> Mr. <unclear> Lambert</unclear> Tree,
     Resident Minister</p>
    
    <pb></pb>
    
<p> that they are products 
in the circumstances all
exceptional and that of 
prejudice in which they could 
given rise to, was alreay
atoned fro to the satisfaction of the 
plaintiffs.</p>

<p> Il be sera oas
unnecessary to recall everything
first that Mr. Stanley
begins his last voyage 
in Africa nib cinne
representative of the State of the
Congo, but as <unclear></unclear>
an organized expedition 
by an English committee 
for the purpose of carrying help 
a Ennin Paeba dout la position dans le
Soudan avait 
éveillé les sympathies
du monde civilisé.</p>
    
<p> Due to the 
philanthropic character and <unclear> unique </unclear>
of his mission, the explorer 
was within his rights to expect</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p> on the active support of 
our authorities you 
will also not be surprised,
Mr. Minister,
that during your arrival at 
Stanley-Pool, the expedition 
finds itself dealing with
some difficulties, the commissioner 
District M. Liebrechts,
<unclear></unclear> obliged to lend
him all of his services.
And these difficulties were 
serious: us food shortage 
reigning in the district, 
the supplies barely sufficient  
there for the ordinary needs 
of the population, and the 
only average of espargner
a disaster: to the a la carvane 
was the était de la metter a même
de continuer au plus tôt
his voyage. Had presence
of this  problem. Mr. 
Stanley had to <unclear></unclear>
all of the tous les moyons de 
transport alors disposables</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p> in the Pool the Baptist
missionary granted only 
the use of his boat 
although <unclear></unclear> refusal was of the 
nature to jeapardize the 
fate of the business may be 
this consideration allows 
her to judge the arbitrary process 
with less rigor 
of which your compatriot 
had instantly appealed to in order to 
achieve his goals. My 
Government doesn't ne sourait
however approve of them, neither
<unclear></unclear> sharing
the responsibility; his agent, 
far from having them favored or 
tolerated, fled there as soon as 
they had been carrying had
his knowledge. On this 
point, we have <unclear></unclear>

themselves.</p>
    
<p> A contract finished
    by being sined, by the intervention 
    of the granted authority</p>
