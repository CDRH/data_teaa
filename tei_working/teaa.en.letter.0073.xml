<p>Sir,<lb/>
I have the honor to inform the 
Department that on the 22nd ultimo 
I visited the British Flag Ship
"Bristol" to resent my respect to 
Commodore Hornby who received 
me with cordial attention and 
saluted me with seven Guns on my 
depature. In consequence of information 
received from the British 
Consul some time since that 
the rank of Commercial Agent was
not known in the British Navy. I 
announced myself on board as United 
States Consul. The Next day 
Commodore

Commodore Hornby returned my
visit and referring to the subject 
he confirmed the British Consul's
statement and further added if 
I had sent him my card as 
Commercial Agent he would not 
have known how to act and most 
assuredly would not have saluted 
me.  The Department will please 
note that I am not in the habit of 
seeking salutes as this was my first. 
Nearly two years in office, I felt it
my duty to make this visit especially 
as this is the third British Commodore 
who has visited this port since 
my appointment as Commercial Agent.
The Commanders of British Vessels 
of War have been very kind to


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0073.003"/>
American Merchants established along 
this coast and not long since 
H M Steam Tender Pioneer, landed
at Ambrizette, Forty Armed Men 
and protected the Trading Factory 
of Mr Harvey Wickes (of New York State) 
for six days from destruction by 
the natives. The "palana" was subsequently 
settled and Mr Wickes lives 
peaceably among them.</p>

<p>The object of this Despatch is to 
show the Department the unpleasant 
situation of Commercial Agents when 
they come in contact with foreign 
vessels of War more especially the 
Commercial Agency of St Paul de 
Loanda, which from its Commercial

importance, and locality frequently  
visited by the squadrons of 
England, France, and Portugal; 
and together from the fact, England 
and Brazil support full Consuls 
here, I am in hope the Department 
will consider the expedency of 
creating the agency to a Consulate 
and thus avert the possibility of 
it's official character being 
misunderstood.</p>
