Extract from a report of the organizer on
the deliberations of the general council of Senegal
</ab>

<ab>
Session of December 1840.
</ab>

<ab>
opinion produced by the general
council
</ab>

<p>
Express the desire that the
foreign vessels be
subjugated in our ports to the
same rights that ours
pay in their country, between-others
the Americans of which the anchorage
in Gorée is one franc per
barrel while the vessels
of the colony that goes in the
Ports of the union are subject there to
the same right of 5..30Par.
</p>

<ab>
Responses presented by Mr Chief of the
administrative service of the colony
</ab>

<p>
The reciprocity reclaimed by the
general council prepare the rights paid
by the foreigners in our colony
and those which we pay in their colony
is a rational thing; but as
the current rights established
have existed for many years and
they can only be modified
by the intervention of the interested
government, that the sort that we suffer
is of a very minimal importance
I do not think there is place to
stop at the opinion emitted by
the general council, as much more
than the commerce of Gorée would have
rather need to extend its <unclear>faulités</unclear>
that to push a disposition
that would not be applied without
inconvenience to the americans
that it is in our interest to attract

in the colony. In the surplus this
question already attracted the attention of the
Department of the navy just as it
results from a dispatch from the 27th of October 1839, 26,302
by which S. E. informs
the local administration that the French
government had wound up near that of
the union in the demand of reciprocity
of right, between the two navigations
that the Minister of the King in Washington
had presented in the name of his government
however if the council of administration
thought that this reciprocity was
indispensable the department of the
Navy could authorize the local <!-- "administration" is hyphenated between 'administra-' and '-tion' -->
administration to lift the right tonnage
from the americans who frequent
Gorée as the minister by the priority
dispatch mentions the thing
as being able to take place.
</p>

<ab>
These conclusions were adapted without observations in a
session of the private council of Senegal, from February 7th 1841.
