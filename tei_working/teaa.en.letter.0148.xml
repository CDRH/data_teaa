<p>United States Consulate
at St Paul de Loanda S.W.C. Africa
Augt. 7th 1882</p>

<p>To
Honorable J.C. Bancroft Davis
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to state that Mr. Henry 
M. Stanley arrived here on board the Belgium
Steamer " Heroda" from Banana, very ill on
the 25th of July, and has resided since at
the Netherland and German Consulate.
He wll leave by the Portuguese Mail steamer
for Madenia, and perhaps Europe.
His sickness has prevented me so far 
obtainng from him any information that 
may be of value to the State Depart.</p>

<p>I have also the honor to report that the 
loss of the British African Maill S.S.
"Ethiopia" Capt Simonds. which struch
on the Indian Rocks off Indian pomit
Latt. 4'" 32' South, and 11" 45' long East
on the 29th of July 1882 7 a.m.
The steamer was abandoned by force

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0148.003"/>
to the natives by her Capt. officers and crew
comperishing 79. souls.</p>

<p>The steamer and cargo are a total loss 
but am told that both are well insured
she had on board 2 packages addressed 
to this consulate which are lost; and
having not received any news from the
U.S. last month I am afraid that it
might have been some thanks form or
othes seut to me by the state Dept.
The Indian pomt, and shoal which rim in
a W.S.W. direction to a distance of 1 3/4
miles has at its furthermass and many
sharp pointed rocks on which the 
"Ethiopia" was wrecked: The loss
of said steamer happening in day 
time, calm weather and smooth seas
cannot but be attributed to gross 
conefessoness, and rather too much
trust in the park of the master to 
some African white traders of Loanda
a Trading settlement 3 miles off Indian
point passengers witg h bornm and 
representing themselves a thoroughly
acquainted with the coast and

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0148.004"/>
<note>22.</note>
particulary the Indian pomt and shove.
The crew now here under the British
Conserl;s care are far from behaving
themselves and are daily and nightly
seen drunk, and as Bilious or green
fever and Dysentry are raging at
present among Europeans the half
of them may soon be in the hospital</p>

<p>I have the honor to be 
Sir
Your obedient servant
L de R. du Verge
U.S. Consul.</p>
