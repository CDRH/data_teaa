CABINET
OF THE
GOVERNOR

Minister
OF THE
NAVY AND THE COLONIES

4th - Direction
Colonies.

1st Office
</ab>

<ab>
On the subject of Mr. May
proposed by the Consul
of the United States to the Navy
to fill in the Reunion
the functions of Consular
Agent.
</ab>

<ab>
Saint Denis, April 20th 1876
</ab>

<p>
Mister Minister,

I have the honor of accusing with
reception Your Excellence of his dispatch
from June 21st of last confirming the
decision by which I had refused to
Mr. Georges Jenkins May, the provisory <!-- 'autorisation' is hyphenated between 'autorisa-' and 'tion' -->
authorization to exercise the functions
of Consular Agent of the United States
in the Reunion.
</p>

<p>
Your Excellence does me the honor
of demanding from me at the same time
the information on Mr. May,
for the case where his government
would desire
</p>

<ab>
To HIs Excellence the Minister of the Navy and the Colonies.
</ab>

<pb facs="20160613_120816.jpg"/>

<p>
would desire to accredit it. I already
had the occasion to transmit to
Your Excellence, by my confidential
letter on the 11th of April, those
that were sent to me and that
were far from being favorable. Mr.
Consul of France in Maurice
confirmed to me, since, the substance,
but without giving me details.
He would certainly be more explicit
toward the Department of Foreign
Affairs, if he was written to
by this Department.
</p>

<p>
Whatever it be, I can
signal to Your Excellence the facts
that are passed to St. Denis and
that demonstrate how little Mr. May
merits
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_120821.jpg"/>

<p>
merits the consideration of the authority
firstly, he put a certain
ostentation to brave the refusal of authorization <!-- 'autorisation' is hyphenated between 'au-' and 'torisation' -->
that I had notified him of
and I had to officially call him back
with the confidence that this time, he would
be held responsable. I deceive myself because,
despite these referred refusals, he committed
two times public act of Consul,
in requiring public force
to stop and imprison
a seaman of English origin
embarked on an American vessel,
and who was at the state of desertation-
put immediately in liberty by
my orders, this seaman, stopped once
more, was on the requisition
of Mr. May affirming the police force
His
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_120833.jpg"/>

<p>
His title of American Consul,
renewed with intense force to his rim.
</p>

<p>
The Consul of His Majesty
Britanic, informed of this fact, must
grasp his Government.
</p>

<p>
As for the local
administration, it deferred, without delay, Mr. May
to the justice. A judiciary instruction
was commenced and he will be rendered
guilty to the Department by a special
report. As of now, I do not hesitate to
say that, even by these facts, Mr.
May would not know the be accredited as
Consular agent in the Reunion.
</p>

<p>
I am with the most profound respect,
Mister Minister,
of Your Excellence
the very obediant servant.
The Governor.
