<p>
Citizen Minister and dear colleague,

The colony of Monrovia founded in June
1822, on the west coast of Africa, by an
American society, to serve as assistance for the 
emancipated slaves, in the United States, declared itself
independent of this society in August 1849, and constituated
itself as a Sovereign State, under the name of Republic <!-- 'République' is split and hyphenated between 'Répu-' and 'blique'. -->
of Liberia.
</p>

<p>
The following September 2nd, the government
of Liberia officially notified Mr. Chaigneau
french lieutenant commander of war,
Bougainville in station at this point, the declaration
of independence of the colony. It addressed at the
same time to this officer a counterpart of the
constitution voted the preceding July 29th, and a
map of the territory of the Republic.
</p>

<ab>
En
</ab>

<ab>
to Citizen Minister of Foreign Affairs.
</ab>

<pb facs="20160613_162438.jpg"/>

<p>
In transmitting February 21st 1848,
these documents to the Minister of the Navy and the 
Colonies, the commander of the french naval
forces on the west coast of Africa, 
informed that the commodore Hotham, in the name of
the British government, and the american officer
placed at the head of the station of the United States, recognized
the Republic of Liberia, and that they gave the order
to recognize its flag.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Montagniès of the Rogue abstained
from making the same manifestation, until he
received the instructions from the Gouvernement.
</p>

<p>
My opinion is that there is place to prescribe to his
successor, Mr Captain of vessel Baudin, to
proceed immediately to the recognition of the
new Republic. Mr Montagniès of the Rogue
only saw a single difficulty there. It consists in
what the chief of an African village, isolated in
the limits of the territory of the Republic of
Liberia, concluded with the officer who commanded the
french station, a treaty in virtue of which this chief
</p>

<p>
considers as the subject of France, et <unclear/>
did not want to accept the laws of the government
of Liberia.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe that there are any <unclear>reservations to</unclear>
make on the subject of this incident. The government
of Liberia, fills a mission on the coast of Africa <!-- 'mission' is split and hyphenated between 'mis' and '-sion' -->
of consideration that it is dignified of the French
Republic to encourage. In <unclear>votre l'insistance </unclear> of <unclear>our</unclear>
commerce we command to enter <unclear>sans notre</unclear> <unclear/>
official relations with this state, so that the <unclear/>
<unclear>remements</unclear> of England and America <unclear>que se faissait</unclear>
<unclear>puit</unclear> accorded in our absence of the <unclear/> <unclear>communications</unclear>
that would not be equally accorded to us at all.
Finally the recollection of the <unclear>predicament that we</unclear>
provoked on the coast of Africa, the <unclear>slaves</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear/>
<unclear/> and <unclear/>, must it seem to me <unclear/> <unclear>to indicate</unclear>
nothing to do that could, nous <unclear/> the <unclear>differentés</unclear>
of the same type.
</p>

<p>
I urge you, citizen Minister and dear
colleague,
