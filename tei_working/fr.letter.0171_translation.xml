                    Mister Minister,
                    on the date of September 14th
                    common, you had wanted to
                    give me knowledge of a
                    report of Mr. May, manager
                    of the vice consulate of France and
                    Sierra-Leone, you signaled,
                    as being able to <unclear/> your
                    influence in these regions,
                    the establishment of an american
                    mission that proposed
                    to stretch the field of <unclear/>
                    action until toward your
                    possessions of Sodan.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I read with interest
                    the information that Mr. May
                    gave you in his report on
                    the organization and the goal of
                    this mission. But I would
                    know <del>donc</del> to share the
                    hopes that this government official
                    seems to hasten a bit too
                    much to found on the presence
                    in Sudan the american
                    missions. One must not
                    forget that, in our colonies
                    especially, the foreign representatives
                    of religious sects <unclear/>
                    under color of <unclear>evangelic</unclear> apostolate,
                    worked on the development of <unclear/>

                    purely political influence. I
                    recognize that, in this
                    circumstance, It is a
                    mission of which the members are
                    citizens of the United States of America
                    and that the government of
                    Washington does not seem to pursue
                    in Africa any project of annexation.
                    We find ourselves nonetheless in
                    presence of protestant missionaries,
                    that will be brought to search for a
                    support, with preference to the
                    french government officials, near the
                    representatives of a nation of which
                    the population in large majority
                    belongs herseld to the
                    reformed religion, that is to say
                    near the brittanic authorities.
                    It is there for the American
                    "Soudan Mission" a
                    tendancy, without doubt rather
                    natural, that we will
                    have, I fear, the occasion
                    to see soon affirm itself.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Also it seems
                    prudent, before favoring
                    <del>comme le propse M. Alby</del> in
                    the french <del>bienui</del> territory the
                    american missionaries, just
                    as the proposal Mr. Alby, to wait
                    until it is possible to appreciate
                </p>

                    the direction that they receive, the hope
                    that brings them. Until then, the
                    more <unclear/> for us
                    seems <unclear/> to conserve regarding
                    a strict neutrality,
                    we <unclear/> to assure them
                    our our support the day where we
                    will be certain that it
                    considers in no way to
                    form against our domination
                    the assistance and the favor of the
                    <unclear>french</unclear> government officials.
