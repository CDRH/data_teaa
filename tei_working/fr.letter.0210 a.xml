<p>The Washington Times, Saturday, June 23, 1906</p>
    
<p>Slocum is Named Consul General to Congo State</p>
    
<p>Secretary Root Would 
Not Make Appointment
Antagonistic</p>
    
<p>Secretary Root has decided upon the
appointment of Clarence R. Slocum, of 
New York, present consul at Weimar,
Germany, as consul general at Boma,
Congo Free State, to fill the office
created by the provisions of the diplomatic
and consular reorganization bill which
has recently been passed by Congress.</p>
    
 <p>The appointment of a consul general
 to the Congo country, which has been
 urged for several years by the Congo
 Reform Association and the American
 missionary societies while meeting with
 their approval as giving this country an
 official representative in the land of alleged
 governmental outrages, will come
 to them as a surprise, owing to the
 personality of the appointee.</p>
    
 <p>Secretary Favored Creation of Post.</p>
    
<p>When Secretary Root finally consented 
to include the creation of a consulate general 
at Boma in his bill, on their persistent
representations, they took great
hope and at once brought pressure to 
bear through members of Congress  and
prominent citizens throughout the country
to be allowed to name some one
thoroughly in sympathy with their reform
movement for the place. Secretary 
Root could not see his way clear to do, 
this, however.</p>
    
<p>When demands for an American official
in the Congo were made this country
hesitated to take any action without
first consulting with the Belgian government
as to whether such an official 
would be acceptable. King Leopold 
replied that he would be glad for America
to have such an official in his South
African colony in order that fair and
unbiased reports on conditions there 
might be made to this government. 
Accordingly, Secretary Root decided upon
Mr. Slocum as a man who would not be
objectionable to the Belgian government
as being identified with the reform
movement.</p>
    
<p>Regardless of scores of formal
petitions and hundred of letters that have
recently reached the State Department
from different sections of the country
particularly from the New England
States, importuning this Government to
intervene in behalf of the people of the
Congo Free State in the face of alleged
conditions brought about through the 
Belgian control of the South African
country, Secretary Root still holds to
his original opinion that there are no
grounds on which the American
Government can interfere at the present
time.</p>
 
<p>Appointment Is Conservative.</p>
 
<p>The Secretary of State has repeated
this announcement to John Daniels, 
secretary of the Congo Reform Association,
of Boston, who has been in Washington
during the week working up interest 
in the Congo movement among 
Senators and Representatives and Government
officials generally. Mr. Daniels
stated that members of the association 
have taken considerable courage through
the creation of a consulate general in
the Congo Free State by the passage 
of Secretary Root's diplomatic and 
consular appropriation bill, and they would
like to recommend some man known
to be favorable to their movement to
the office. Secretary Root gave no 
encouragement in this time, but promised
Mr. Daniels that great care and pains
would be exercised in the selection of...</p>
