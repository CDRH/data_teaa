Foreign Office,
    30th January, 1919,

                                                            Conference of Missionary Societies, 
                                                                        in Great Britan and Ireland,
                                                                                    117 Victoria Street, S.W.L.
                                                                                            10th January, 1919.
Sir:-
                I am directed by the Standing Committee of 
the Conference of Missionary Societies, in which the 
missionary organizations of all the CHristian bodies
in Great Britain and Ireland other than the Roman 
Catholics are officially represented, to transmit the 
accompanying Memorandum on the subject of Christian 
missions in Africa at the Peace Conference and to ask 
for its favourable consideration by His Majesty's 
Government. 
                                    I am.,
                                 (Signed) J.H. Oldam.



<unclear/> Right Honourable,
                    Arthur J. Balfour, F.R.S., O.M., M.P.,
                            H.M. Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affair Foreign Office, 
                                                                LONDON. S.W.L

                        MEMORANDUM ON 
    CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN AFRICA AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE.

                        (1) This Memorandum is submitted by the 
Standing Commmittee of the Conference of Missionary 
Societies in which the missionary organizations of 
al the Christian bodies in Great Britain and Ireland 
other than the Roman Catholics are officially 
represented.

                        (2) The General Act of the Conference of 
Berlin in 1885 contains an article providing in 
explicit terms for freedom of conscience and religious 
toleration and for liberty for Christian missions to 
carry on their work in the parts of Africa covered by 
the Act. The full text of the article is quoted 
in an appendix. The Standing Committee of the Conference
of Missionary Societies desire to repreent to His
Majesty's Government that in the event of any internatinal
agreement with reference to the future government 
of tropical Africa being reached at the Peace Conference
the rights andliberties secured to Christian missions
under the Berlin Act should be conserved. The 
Committee are confident that Christian public opinion 
in Great Britain and Amercica will expect that in the 
endeacours of the Peace Conference to lay the foundations
of a new order based on justice and right the
disinterested and beneficent work of Christian missions 
on behalf of the native races of Africa will not be 
placed in a less favourable position than that 
accorded to it by the Berlin Act.
3. THe Committee are aware of the practical 
difficulites arising out of the war in reaffirming 
the Article of the Berlin Act in its present form. <uclear/>
do not regard all the provisions of the Article 
as essential. Having given careful thought to the
subject they desire to submit a statement of their 
views of the course that might reasonably be 
adopted in conformity with the declared policy of 
His Majesty's Government and of other governments with 
reference to Christian missions. While other Powers have
at different times entered into treaties guaranteeing 
religious toleration and freedom for the work of 
Christian missions, reference is made, here for the 
sake of brevity, only to the policy of the American 
and British Governments. 
            Policy of the American Government.
(4)  The general policy of the Government of the
United States in regard to missionaries and missions 
questions is set forth in a statement from the <unclear/>
for the Department of State in Washington communicates 
to the World Missionary Conference held in Edinburst <unclear/>
1910, and printed in Volume VII of the Report of thath
COngerence (pp.123-34). A summary of the policy as
expressed in treaties and correspondence between the 
United States and other Powers is given in the following 
quotation:
    "The policy of the United States is that missionaries 
     and merchants stand upon an equality in the eye of 
     the law; that every man, whether he be preacher 
     or man of affairs, is first of all a citizen of the
     Unitied States, and, as such, entitled to protection to 
     his person and property so far as international law
     permits, and the right, whether he be tradesman or 
     churchman, to follow his calling. Just as the United
     States has entered into innumerable commercial treaties 
     is order to secure for American industry and commerce in
     foreign parts equal rights and privileges with the 
     native, so the United States has entered into treaties with 
     various countries by the terms of which American 
     missionaries are specifically granted the right to
     reside within the territory, to acquire property
     necessary for their misison, nad to preach the Gospel 
     to natives, provided that this be done without seeking
     to disturb the political organisation of the country 
     in which they reside."
               Policy of His Majesty's Government 
             (5) The policy of His Majesty's Government 
in regard to Christian missions has recently been the 
subject of discussion between the Government and the
Conference of Missionary Societies in Great Britain and 
Ireland. As the result of these discussions the Government 
has drawn up memoranda embodying its policy. The 
memoranda in their present form deal only with India,
but it is understood thath the same policy will be applied
to other parts of the Empire. This statement of policy
<uclear/> received the approval of the Conference of Missionary 
Societies. The main features of this policy are the 
following:               
           (a) The services of Christian missions in protect
the material and moral welfare of polulations under 
British rule are recognised and their co-operatives in
the future welcomed in the opening paragraph of the 
memoranda in the following terms: 
    " Appreciating to the full the value of the work 
    done in the past by missionary and other <unclear/> 
    societies and organisations, His Majesty's Government 
    and the Government of India cordially welcome the 
    co-operation in the future in furthering the <unclear/>
    and material well-being of the peoples of India."
    (b) So far as Great Britain and America are <unclear/> 
the policy rests upon the voluntary co-operation of the 
Conference of Missionary Societies in Great Britian and 
Ireland and of the Foreign Missions Congerence of North
America with His Majesty's Government. The Conference will
submit to the Government lists of "recognised" societies
which they believe to be prepared to assume, and to be
capable of exercising, responsibility for the control
of their missionaries. No restrictions will be imposed
on missionaries of these societies. Missionaries of
societies that are not "recongised" must obtain a permit
from the Government authorising them to carry on their 
work. In any question that may arise between His 
Majesty's Government and any recognised society or 
member of such society the Government will address the
Conference, who will use their good offices to
regulate the affair.
    In regard to <unclear/> <unclear/> missions, His Majesty's
Government will lead <unclear/> Cardinal Archbishop
of Westminster who will in the same way recommend to 
His Majesty's Government a list of "recognised"
societies. 
(c) In the intersts of pyblic security missionaries
of alien enemy nationality are excluded for a period 
to be defined herafter and missionaries of other 
nationalities than British or American must obtain a 
permit authorising them to carry on their work.
THese restrictions, however, are based on the abonormal 
condiditons created by the war and the way is left open 
for their removal and for the extension of the principle
of freedom and of the voluntary co-operation of 
missionary bodies wiht His Majesty's Government when 
political conditions justify it. 
                Proposals in regard to Africa.
          (6) It is in the view of the Standig Committee
of the COnference of Missionary Societies essential 
that any new international agreement that may be 
reached in regard to the future of tropical Africa
should contain provisions guaranteeing freedom of 
conscience and religious toleration and securing to
both natives and foreigners freedom from interference 
in the exercies of their religion and from any 
political or civil disability on the ground of their 
religious beliefs or in consequence of a change of 
faith.
          (7) The Committee are further of opinion 
that Christian missions are entitled to claim thath the 
services which they have rendered in the past to the 
cause of education and civilisation should be 
revognised by the Powers and their co-operation is 
the future in promoting the material and moral
well-being of the natives of Africa should be 
explicitly welcomed. This claim they believe to 
be justified on the following grounds: 
          (a) The position already secured to Christian 
missions under the Berlin Act:
          (b) the fact that the education of the natives
of Africa has up to the present been mainly the work
of Christian missions and the further services rendered 
by them in the exploration and opening up of the
continent, in linguistic science, in the study of the
customs and habits of the people and in the advancment 
of civilisation generally; and 
          (c) because the disinterested work of Christian 
missions on behalf of the natives of Africa is a valuable
support to the principle of trusteeship which is the 
acknowledged basis of British policy in the government 
of subject races and which it is hoped will be 
embodied in the constitution of the League of Nations
to be established at the Peace Conference.
          (8) The COmmittee recognise that it may be 
necessary in consequence of the war to impose temporary 
restrictions upon missions of certain nationalites.
So long as such restrictions are imposed as temporary 
and exceptional measures rendered necessary by abnormal
conditions, they are not in conflict with the principle
of freedom for missionary work which must be the basis
of any policy that will satisfy Christian public
opinion in Great Britain and America. 
          (9) Governments may justly claim that
missionaries of foreign nationality admitted to work 
in their territories should abstain from all interference 
in the political organization of the country.
The missionary societies represented in the British 
and American Conferences are willing to give voluntarily
to any foreign government in whose territory they may
be working a declaration recognising that all the 
obedient and respect should be given to the lawfully 
constituted government and that while carefully 
abstaining from political affairs it is their desire
and purpose that their influence, so far as it may be 
properly exerted in such matters, should be so exerted 
in loyal co-operation with the government of the 
country concerned and that they will only employ agents 
who will work in this spirit. It is believed that 
missionary scieties in other countries would be 
equally willing to give such an undertaking.
          (10) It is recognised that it may sometimes 
be right and necessary for governments to impose 
temporary restrictions on missionary work in the
interests of public order and security: and, further,
that the necessity may occasionally arise of restraining
the activities of indiscreet individuals, more particularly 
of those who are not the agents of some 
responsible missionary organization. It is submitted
that if difficulties should arise in connection with 
these of other matters involving the relations of 
misisons with governments any differences that may
exist can best be adjusted by friendly discussing 
between responsible missionary bodies and the 
government concerned.
    The settlement of such difference has been 
made easier by the growth in recent years of a 
missoinary organization adapted to the purpose.
There are now in Great Britain and AMerica conferences 
in which all the important missionary 
organizations in each country, other than Roman 
Catholic, are represented. Similar organizations
exist in some of the countries on the continent of 
Europe and there are links, which may be expected
to become closer in the future, between Protestant 
missions on the contienent and the conferences in 
Great Britain and America. There are further, in the
principal mission fieldsm local conferences represented
all the missions working in each area. These bodies
which in the mission fields are composed of the most 
experienced missionaries and at home include
responsible leaders in the different churches and <unclear/>
experienced in public affairs, may be relied upon not
to put forward or support unreasonable claims. A more
detailed statement of this missionary organinzation is 
given in an appendix.
    It is respectfully submitted that the voluntary
co-operation of these responsible missionary bodies
with governments furnishes and adequate and sufficient 
means of dealing with any difficulties which may arise 
and may be expected to result in an increasing 
understanding between missions and governments and
is their more effective co-operation, each in their 
own proper sphere, in promoting the welfare of the
native races of Africa.
          (11) The Standing Committee of the Conference
of Missionary Societies have not sufficient information
regarding the probable action of the Peace Conference
with reference to tropical Africa to justify them 
in making definite proposals. But for the sake of 
<unclear/> and to indicate the practical bearing of the 
views expressed in this memorandum they suggest that,
is the event of a new international agreement being
subsituted for the Berlin Act, it should include an 
article to the following effect:
         "Freedom of conscience and religious toleration 
         are guaranteed both to natives and foreigners. 
         The followers of all religions shall be free from 
         interference in the exercise of their religion and 
         from any political or civil disability on the 
         ground of their religoius beliegs or in consequence 
         of a change of faith.
                "The Powers appreciate the value of the work
         done in the past by Christian missions and cordially 
         welcome their co-operation in the future in promoting 
         the moral and material well-being of the peoples of 
         Africa. Subject to such restrictions as they may
         find it necessary in consequence of the war to
         impose for a period on missions of certain 
         nationalitiesm the right of missions to teach the
         Christian religion, to acquire and hold property
         and to erect buildings for missionary purposes is 
         recognised."
