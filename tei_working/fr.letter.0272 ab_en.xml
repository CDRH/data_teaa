<p> Belgian Kégation
604/284.</p>

<p>Washington, the 28th of July 1910.</p>

<p>Very confidential.</p>

<p>(Copy.)</p>

<p>Mr. Minister,</p>

<p>I have the honor to refer to my report
486/236 of last June the 14th.</p>

<p>Returning before yesterday in Washington, at the end of my
consular inspection, I learned that the superior civil servant
with whom I've had conversations about the Congo 
was absent and did not return qu'on Septembre. He advised 
me to go see Mr. Adee, one of the assistant Secretaries 
of State, to whom Mr. Knox told me recently to entrust the direction 
of relative matter in the Congo. </p>

<p> I just talked with Mr. Adee. From the first 
words, this one spontaneously spoke with me of the symapathy and of the
great confidence that our King and his government inspires 
to the United States Government, in particular with 
their action towards the issues in the Congo.</p>

<p> He made the following declaration, that I also reproduce
litterally everything possible,- and a ajouré, in response to 
my question, that he speek of the name of the Secretary of State:</p>

<p>"We have examined what there is to do concerning 
the acknowledgement of the annexation of the Congo, and we have 
found that one formal declaration of acknowledgement isn't generally 
considered as necessary, nor even generally  
common.- (I told Mr. Adee that I was of the same opinon 
never having, in accordance with the views of the Government of the King, 
demanded the formal accomplishment of this act.)"</p>

<p>"We consider, - the Secretary of State
then said- that we have already recognized the de facto annexation 
of the Congo to the Belgians, -and by the recent extension of 
our minimal tarif to this colony, and by the form of</p>

<p> Mr. Davignon
Brussels Minister of 
Foreign Affaires.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p> contact form our Consuls in Congo with your authorities."</p>

<p> "When the United States annexed Alaska, and
then Hawaï they did not judge that they know to wait for 
Power one recognition in any special form." I
repeat, we have recognized the de facto annexation of the Congo" </p>

<p>"I add that your King and your Government, 
thanks to their evident wishes of establishing what we call 
non of the "reforms" (a term which was used excessively)
but the "necessary modification", possessing good wishes,
sympathy and the entire confidence for the United States 
Government. "The sentiments that I've expressed are shared by
all the members in the Department of State."</p>

<p>"You are completely authorised to repeat the declaration
that I just made to the King of Belgium and to his 
Government."</p>

<p> In thanking Mr. Adee, I told him in confidence
that we were rested up to here with the last exchanges 
of devoted writing that was linked between our two Governments,-
documents taht were not marked with the same character 
as the present declaration; and for this reason, 
this one was very well welcomed.</p>

<p> He responded to me that at the time of the Secretary of State's 
return, he was able to envisage with him the question of knowing if 
one ce <unclear></unclear> written could add someting
within reach of what he had just told me.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, Mr. Ministre, etc...
(s.) of Buisseret</p>
