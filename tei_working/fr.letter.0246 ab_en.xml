of rubber and the later placement).</p>

any commerce. If one acts to establish 
any societal trade, the status of this society 
must be deposed to the courts administration service of the Tribunal to the primary authority,
in Boma.</p>
    
<p>The religious associations don't legally recognize 
that by the grant of the civil personification; this 
one demands by the adressed requê to the Governor General,</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>she grants by the order of the Sovereign King.</p>

enclosed (Annexs I and II).</p>
    
<p>III.- Every person who wants to buy or take 
other land for lease on which it 
exists, for the profit of the outsiders, the owner's rights duly 
noted, must do it the demande either to the Secretary 
of State in Brussels, or the Governer General in Boma.</p>
    
<p>IV.- The principle taxes to acquit in the Congo are 
1o le rix d'achat or from renting the proptery, if they 
belong to the domaine of the State. (Annex III_)</p>
