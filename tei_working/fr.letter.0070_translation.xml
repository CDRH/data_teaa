Paris, July 2nd 1839

<p>
Mister Admiral and dear colleague,
according to the considerations exposed in the letters
that Mr. vice admiral of Rosamel 
adressed to the Department of Foreign Affairs,
on May 18th and November 11th 1838, Mr <del>Ae</del> Molé
had invited the Legation of S. M. in Washington
to start the process with the Federal
government so that the advantages accorded by
the act of May 9th 1828 at the origin of
our Antilles are heard by the french 
marines coming from Cayenne and Senegal
in return of the treatment that the flag of
the Union receives in its possessions and as
a result of which it finds itself assimilated there with
the french flag, in that which concerns the <supplied>rights</supplied>
of navigation on the importations from <supplied>abroad.</supplied>
</p>

<p>
The head of affairs of the King in the
United States announces to me, under the date of May
1st, that the Cabinet of Washington has

the intention to propose at the next
Congress the abolition of the differential rights on
the french <unclear>navires</unclear> coming from Cayenne, but
that it <unclear>se</unclear> <unclear/> to make a similar
proposition in <unclear>favor</unclear> of the origins of Senegal,
<unclear/> the commerce of the United States could not
<unclear>help it to profit from</unclear> the ports of this
last colony, from a treatment based on
the principle of reciprocity.
</p>

<p>
It is to you, Mister Admiral
and dear colleague, that it rests to examine
and the <unclear/> that the federal government
<unclear>offers</unclear> to the <unclear>expeditions</unclear> of Senegal for the
United States would not be more than <unclear>compensated</unclear>
by <unclear>those</unclear> that it would become necessary
to accord in this colony, to the american
commerce. I will limit myself thus to give
you communication of the note adressed
to the head of affaires of the King by Mr.
<unclear>Forsythe</unclear> and to urge you to inform
me of the determination to which

consideration.
