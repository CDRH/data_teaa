<p>
Mister Minister

After having taken the opinion of the committees of commerce of
Saint Louis and Gorée, I submitted to the council the question
posed by your dispatch from October 11th. 1838. 110. 231. The committees and the
majority of the council were of the opinion to use reciprocity with
the Americans, and to ask for a dollar per barrel the right
of anchorage to perceive on theirs vessels. This opinion is not
my own, and here are the motives on which it is based.
</p>

<p>
It is not in the interest of the treasury that the American
Government struck the right of a dollar per barrel from the French
vessels coming from Senegal. They receive so little from this
origin; that this augmentation of revenue can not be sensible
The americans, displeased with what we reject them from
Sénégambie, wanted to use reprisals as much as they
could; they thought that to protect us from a costly
right, we would make to them some concessions. The American
Government will not reduce its right of anchorage, which is not
expected. The injust measures strain too much the reason for
which they are not firstly long and hard reflected upon.
</p>

<p>
If we wear from one franc, per dollar the right
of anchorage in Gorée, is it not to be feared that the americans
will again augment that which they striked from our vessles: in
addition, the vessels of the union that only rest in Gorée 
to leave there a weak part of their cargo, will stop
in all probability going there if we rest true to the 
principle.
</p>

To His Excellence the Minister Secretary of State
of the Navy and the Colonies.
