<ab>
The Ambassador of France in Washington,
to Mister Minister of Foreign Affairs.
</ab>

<ab>
Washington, May 30th 1899.
</ab>

<p>
The negro people of the United States have just
launched a call to foreign nations to ask them
for protection.
</p>

<p>
This document is the expression of the terror <!-- 'terreur' is hyphenated between 'ter-' and 'reur' -->
that weighs on a part of the population of
this country.
</p>

<p>
Following the war of Secession, the
negroes were declared citizens and the Government
in the Southern States passed between their hands. They
kept it until 1877, time in which the
whites removed power from them, sometimes with
lively force and either by fraud or by intimidation, <!-- 'intimidation' is hyphenated between 'inti-' and 'midation -->
hindering them from voting. Ever since then,
this situation lasted: the negroes in fact did not vote <!-- 'votent' is hyphenated 'vo-' and 'tent' -->
at all.The State of Mississippi has just
adjusted this situation in submitting the exercise <!-- 'exercice' is hyphenated between 'exer-' and 'cice' -->
of the right to vote to exams on the knowledge <!-- 'connaissance is hyphenated between 'connais-' and 'sance' -->
of the Federal Constitution, that has
no worth for the whites and that will suffer to
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_103059.jpg"/>

<p>
remove the rights of the blacks. The Supreme Court decided
that this clause of the Constitution of Mississipi, <!-- 'Mississipi' is hyphenated between 'Mis-' and 'sissipi' -->
not applying to the negro race in the
capacity of race, was constitutional. One can
thus predict that it will be generalized.
</p>

<p>
In reality, all juridic guarantee is
refused to the negroes. There is not need of another
example that that of the Jury of Charleston does not condemn <!-- 'condamnant' is hyphenated between condam-' and 'nant' -->
the individuals that, in Lake City last
year, assassinated the Director of the Post
and his family because he was negro, and it is
remarkable that Judge Brawley who presided the
seats all in severely blaming the authors of the
crime declared that the authorities who had named
this Director of the Post were equally responsable. <!-- 'responsables' is hyphenated between 'respon-' and 'sables' -->
</p>

<p>
Last April 23rd, a certain Samuel
Hose assassinated a cultivator and violated his wife.
The whites took possession of him, burned him alive,
cut up his body and sold the pices
to the bids in the middle of 2000 people. He was
found by journalists to excuse the popular
violence and the same day two other negroes of which
a pastor, were hung in the same region, without
committing any crime.
</p>

<p>
Since then, there has not been one
day without us having learned that one or more
negroes were assassinated. I will give to you
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_103109.jpg"/>

<p>
an example of the death of the negro Pevug and his
wife in Atlanta, the assassinators committed at the end
of March in Arkansas in Texarkana: the number is
unknown, the triple lynchage in Texas in
Houston that just took place in these last few days,
the murders committed in Griffin (Georgia): there, there
was formed an association to oblige the facotries <!-- 'industriels' is hyphenated between 'in-' and 'dustriels' -->
to refuse to employ blacks without defense are drowned. Finally these past few days, in Fayetteville <!-- 'Fayetteville' is hyphenated between 'Fay-' and 'etteville' -->
(Gc) an inoffensive negro was taken from his own <!-- The 'c' in '(Gc)' is in superscript -->
house and killed without reason.
</p>

<p>
It is not surprising the the negroes
are arming themselves and dream of vengeance. It is just as one
saw pastor Rausom of the Methodist Church dare
to speak in the pulpit about using dynamite against the
whites. But this excess of speech can only bring <!-- 'amener' is hyphenated between 'a-' and 'mener' -->
new crimes. Other remedies are put
in advance to conjure this situation. The first
and the most natural was the political influence <!-- 'politique' is hyphenated between 'politi-' and 'que' -->
of the blacks always being brought to the side of the
Republicans, maybe it would be good to bring it <!-- 'porter' is hyphenated between 'por-' and 'ter' -->
to the side of the democrats, the Southern States belonging <!-- 'appartenant' is hyphenated between 'ap-' and 'partenant' -->
to this party.
</p>

<p>
Others like the Bishop H.M.Turner 
proclaimed that the unique remedy was the complete
separation of whites and blacks and that those who
would have to emigrate to Africa and found a Republic there, <!-- 'République' is hyphenated between 'Ré-' and 'publique' -->
Africa to the Africans.
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_103120.jpg"/>

<p>
Others finally proposed to construct
industrial villages in the North where one would not employ <!-- 'emploierait' is hyphenated between 'em-' and 'ploierait' -->
any white worker. I have fear that this
humanitarian project only hides a means for certain
factories to procure the workforce to
work well.
</p>

<p>
Whatever it be, numerous negro
families in the South leave the country and as there
8 to 10 million blacks in the United States,
that the natality in this race is considerable
one can predict that from here in a few years a redoubtable <!-- 'problème' is hyphenated between 'pro-' and 'blème' -->
problem will be posed to the country, that
may see a new servile war./.
