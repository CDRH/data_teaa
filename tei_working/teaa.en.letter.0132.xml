<p>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
16th September 1881</p>

<p>Sir,
I have the honor to 
enclose a translation of a 
Despatch received from His
Excellency the Governor General
of this Province in reply to
my request to reduce the Fees
and Charges levied on Whaling
Vessels sowing to this port.
You will notice by the translation
that His Excellency has kindly
granted my request, and
that now the charges are so
moderate that I should think
it would not keep vessels from
coming to a port where they
will find greater facilities in 
arranging Provinces or any
thing they may require,
than in any other port
<catchwords>on</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0132.003"/>
on the coast.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be 
Sir
Your most Obedient Servant
Rob S. Newton
Vice Consel</p>

<p>To the 
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington D.C.</p>

<!--enclosed translation-->

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0132.004"/>
<p>Translation of Governor
General Dantes's Despatch
dated 3rd August 1881.</p>

<p>In answer to your Despatch
dated the 14th July, His
Excellency the Governor General
has ordered me to communicate
the following:--</p>

<p>1st that Whalers are allowed 
to come into port for the span
of 6 days or for a longer time
when requested, free of all expenses
with the exception of 
400 Reis or 40 cents a day while
in port; for a Custom House
Guard and 1500 Reis or 1.62 Cents
for the Health Vesel; all the
captain of the Port charges will
be 1,500 Reis or 1.62 Cents for
bringing the ship into port, and 
1,500 Reis or 1.62 cents for beer
<catchwords>pilotage</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0132.005"/>
Pilotage out.</p>

<p>2nd That the said Whalers can
Store their Oil in the Custom
House, paying 2% ad valorem on
re-shipment; keeping it in the 
Custom House for another 6 
months it will pay 20 Reis or 
2 cents for ever 10 letres. Ships
gear etc. stored in the Custom
House are free from their last
charge. You must take note
that these advantages are only
valid in the Loanda Custom
House, not at those of Massamedes
and Benguella, as they are
not deposit Custom Houses, and
are not adapted to store large
quantities of Cash.</p>

<p>3rd Lastly, Whalers can receive
Provisions etc from the ships that
come usually every 6 months from
America with their supplies, trans-shipping
Oil to them without paying 
any duties whatever.</p>

<p>In case you have any
<catchwords>remarks</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0132.006"/>
remarks to make on what His
Excellency the Governor General
has ordered me to communicate
to you, will you kindly do so,
as His Excellency is willing to 
do all in his power, within the
Law, to facilitate Whalers coming
into this port, and harmonising
the interests of these with the
Laws to which they are subject</p>

<p>signed João José da Silva
Acting Secretary</p>

<p>To the
Vice Consul of the 
United States
St Paul de Loanda.</p>
