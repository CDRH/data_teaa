Sir,
I have the honor to acknowledge 
dispatch no 43, dated May 6th,
1886 from the Department of State
involving a draft of a new treaty 
and a "Full Power" from the President
 for you to conclude the
same.</p>
<p>I at once placed myself in
communication with His Highness
the Sultan of Zanzibar and
sent him a draft of the proposed
treaty.</p>
<p>His Highness expressed himself
as very much qualified that the
United States Goverment was
willing to make a new treaty
to his advantage.  The treaty was
immediately drawn up in the
English and Arabic languages, and
on the third July <sic>is was </sic>signed
by myself and H. H. Plenipotentiary.</p>
<p>The treaty was made in duplicate; 
our copy is enclosed
with this dispatch the other
is in His Highness's possession.</p>
<p>I have read over carefully the
English &#38; German treaties and I
cannot see that there are any advantages.
that they get that is not afforded
us.</p>
<p>His Highness the Sultan did
not raise our question but ordered
the treaty got ready.</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted to our
<unclear>Kanji Ragjah</unclear>, a native gentleman
how who is an intimate friend
of His Sultan, in getting the treaty

Sir:
I have the honor to request the
Department of State to inform me
if any allowance will be made me
for making the new treaty with the
Sultan of Zanzibar.</p>
<p>I consider that such work is
outside of the line of a Consul's duty
and it made a great deal of extra
work and trouble, as is always the
case in these Oriental countries.</p>
<p>The Treaty was to be got through
in a great hurry and it was only
from my being as any old friend of
the Sultan's that it was finished
in as short a time.</p>
<p>The salary of this Consulate is only $1000 per annum and I
consider that $500 would be a fair
recompese for my outside work on this 
new treaty</p>

Sir:
I have the honor to make 
herewith a letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the
Department of State a copy of
which he has sent to the Consulate
and which I have translated
and also enclosed herewith. </p>

<p>The sum and substance of
the communication is, a request 
of our Government to sanction
a tax on his own subjects, which
I have answered His Highness will
be undoubtedly granted him.</p>

<p>The Germans &#38; English as
a pretense for making trouble with
the Sultan, claim that he has no
right to levy any taxes or duties
on any produce raised in the 
Sultanate of Zanzibar other
than in specified in new
treaties, even on his own subjects.
The Sultan claims that he has a right to tax his own subjects
as he pleases and produce belonging
to them--</p>
<p>This is a matter which does not in the least concern
Americans or American interests in any way and which I
assume that our Government
will not care for me to take any
part in the troubles likely to arrive
from this dispute.</p>

<p>We had the honor to inform you in a telegram of the 6th August that we directed

concluded that with your country entered in force
on the 19th of August 1886 corresponding to the
Kirawahili New Year and that the Custom 
House is in our own hands.</p>
<p>I have to inform you that in the new
treaties are not mentioned fifty five articles
of produce of our <unclear></unclear> and on which we always 
had 5% duty. This produce has nothing
to do with the imports and exports by Europeans.</p>
<p>It concerns only my own people who 
do not pay any other taxes, so we continue
to tax the fifty-five articles of produce as before
at 5%. </p>
<p>We send you the names of the fifty-five 
articles of named produce in a list
joined to the letter and ask you to consider
it and sanction it.  Salaam!</p>

Zanzibar. Dec.20.1886
To the Hon.
Third Assist Secr. of State
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to inform
you that the 14th inst.
a fleet of six German Man-of-war
under Admiral Knorr
arrived at this fort followed
on the 15th by two French
and one English is now
lying in the harbor.</p>
<p>The object of this movement has not yet been made public
but it is understood that
the Sultan has been compelled 
to cede a large portion of his
Coast territory to Germany and
one seaport to England.</p>
<p>This, of course, is the end
of Arab power on this Coast forever.</p>

<p>In my opinion American
interests and all foreign interests
but Germany, will suffer
greatly by these changes and
it is greatly to be regretted
that some government would
not assist the Sultan's government against this German
robbery.</p>
<p>Considering that the Sultan's 
power to control the various
wild &#38; lawless tribes which are
under his scrutiny, will be
materially weakened and that
our large American interests
 are absolutely without protection 
in case of riot or bombardment, 
and that as the
first treaty power with the
Sultan we should be in some
way sophisticated in the important
changes and transfers soon
to take place. I recommend
that an American man-of-war
of good sire be sent to remain
here at Zanzibar until this trouble is definitely settled.</p>
 <p>I trust that the government
 will take immediate
action in this matter as it
is one which admits of no 
delay.</p>
<p>As representative of the
two largest houses in Zanzibar
I feel very anxious about the
large amount of property belonging
to me lying exposed
to fire or any incindiary acts.
Also the future of the American
trde seems very uncertain and
I fear will be very much injured
by the precedence which this affair will give Germany--

<p>To the Hon.
Third Assit. Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform
you that the German
operations on this Coast have
so far resulted in the acquistion 
of a strip of mangrove
swamp and marsh land some
forty miles long, situated on the
Coast about two hundred miles
North of Zanzibar, also a German
protectorate is acknowledged
for Witu, and the lease of two
Custom Houses on the Coast
to the German East African Trading
Company- the Sultan's author is restricted to a strip
of coast found ten miles wide extending from Tungu Bay to 
<unclear>Kapumi</unclear> and ten miles around
Each of his Bin Addah towns 
but the terms of this agreement
are I suppose more familiar <!--*2501-->
to the Department than to me. 
At the time of writing my
Despatch No. 106 in which I
suggest that a man-of-war
be sent here on account of this
German incident feeling against
white-men in town was very
bitter and there was every prospect
of trouble, but at present the
negotiations are progressing favorably
&#38; quietly and there
is now no necessity for a man-of-war
to call here, although is always <add place="above">has</add>a good effect, and 
I should very much like to 
see one of our gun-boats in
the harbor for a month or two
just at present. </p>
<p>The workings of the new 
tarrif on articles imported in 
to the island of Zanzibar
from the mainland are not
wholly satisfactory - this is
especially applicable to Ivory 
the market price of which it
is very difficult to fit and the
Sultan's Collector of Customs
at present is a most unsuitable
man for the place and who
uses his position unfairly to
further his own business; his
also, by buying small lots at
high prices keeps the price of
Ivory for above what it should
be--as my commercial position
in Zanzibar is principally to
buy Ivory this affects me directly.</p>
<p>As soon as the German
affair is settled, the Sultan
 will be forced to summon this
Collector and observe the spirit as well as the letter of the treaties.
I am financially in sympathy
with the Germans &#38; English
in this moment although
I am aware that our goverment
does not wish to interfere
in any way with the internal
affairs of the Sultan's government
but I think that a joint protest 
of the German, English and
American Consuls against this
man's continuing in office will
benefit all nationalities without
unpleasant complications.</p> 
<p>I have to report the death
of the Interpreter of this Consulate
<unclear>Joharri bin Saif</unclear> on the 29th inst.
after a service of nearly forty years:
his place will probably be filled
by an appointer of Consul Pratts
after he takes over the office.

has been recalled at the instance of Prince Bismark. </p>
<p>In this connection the
resignation of Sir John Kirk

<p>The imports from the United

nominally of refined Petroleum,

These bring the staples handled
by the American houses engaged

of this by its phenomenal cheap-ness
 has completely taken the
place of the vegetable oils in which
former times were used
exclusively for illuminating
purposes.</p>

<p>Can petroleum is often sold in 
this market as low as one dollar
and a quarter -- United 
States currency-- which fact would not
command it-to- the serious
consideration of exporters in the
America.  The yearly consumption
of East Africa--Zanzibar
being the distributing point
is upwards of 75,000 cases.</p>
<p>American cottons have for
many years been the standards
in this market but their

<p>The clause in the

<unclear>duty of</unclear> <unclear>twenty-five per cent</unclear>
in <unclear></unclear> is politically

the fact that France has

<p>Naturally, the English and German merchants objected

<p>The Sultan <unclear></unclear>

that this new rate was <unclear></unclear>
in part as a compensation for a reduction
of the duty in certain articles of the Export is not
inclaimed to allow <unclear></unclear> foreign

<p>No. 25
Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar, November 10, 1887.</p>

<p>Honorable James D. Porter,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to ask
has the Department at this 
time in relation to this Claim
of Dr. B. F. Wilson against
Sultan Abdallah, King of 
Johanna.</p> <!-- Based on timing, is this Saidi Abdallah bin Salim? -->

<p>This claim is of long
standing and the Department
has long since been <!--*3517-->
had acquainted <unclear></unclear>
<unclear></unclear> of the same.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson now appeals
again to the Government of
the United States through
the Department of State
for some relief from the
<unclear>burden</unclear> under which he 
is laboring. </p>

<fw>2</fw>
<p>To my own knowledge, he 
(Dr. Wilson) is <unclear></unclear> <!--3543-->
and is consequently
so <unclear>plussed</unclear> by his condition
in all sides as to be <unclear></unclear>
by harpoons in the proclusion
of his <unclear></unclear>
</p>
<p>By his <unclear></unclear> and
<unclear>intelligent</unclear> efforts he has
<unclear></unclear> plantation
to such a state of perfection as to make it
(if unencumbered) a most-desirable
property.</p>
<p>But with its present debt
it is quite impossible for
him to work it to a profit.</p>
<p>There is no <unclear></unclear>
that had the King of Johanna
not taken the <unclear>Contemptable</unclear>
a claim he did to injure
his prospects he (Dr. Wilson)
would have been how in
a position to realize large
<unclear>benefits</unclear> from his <unclear>imparted</unclear>
<fw>3</fw>
<unclear>Estate.</unclear> 3 September, 1885. When <!--*3609-->
Commander <unclear> P. F. Manning</unclear> for
visited Johanna in the
<unclear>"Jornata"</unclear> he made <unclear></unclear>
<unclear></unclear> the matter as far as
was possible and it was
very difficult to get away
<unclear></unclear> to go in board the
<unclear>"Jornata"</unclear> to <unclear>testify</unclear> against
the King. Knowing that at the moment the vessel left
they would be <unclear>punished</unclear>
for so <unclear>doing</unclear>.</p>
<p>Dr. William has when
opportunity offered obtained
what evidence he could 
bearing in his case: and
I am sending the same
herewith, as per the sub.
<unclear>joined</unclear> list of evidences.</p>
<p>When Captain <unclear>Pattar</unclear>
was at Johanna in the
"Lancaster" in April of last
year he was inclaimed to
take some <unclear></unclear> in the
matter.</p>


<fw>4</fw>

<p>But the arrival 
of the French gunboat
<unclear>"Chaeal"</unclear> in the harbor bearing <!--*3616-->
the Commandant of
<unclear>Mayatta</unclear>
from his government to take
from the Protectorate of the
Island but a new phase
in the affair and the
"Lancaster" <unclear></unclear> in good
<unclear></unclear>
</p>
<p><unclear></unclear> appear that
the King was coerced into
signing the treaty with the 
French in account of the
<unclear></unclear> of an American
man o'war in <unclear>Burt</unclear> from
the fact that he afterwards
<unclear></unclear> against receiving
the French resident who
was finally lauded by
<unclear>Jrei</unclear> in April of this year.</p>
<p>I am informed that
the President has recently
been negotiating a new

<fw>5</fw>
treaty with the King but I
have no idea what <unclear></unclear> <!--*3632-->
have been made.</p>
<p>From all that I
have been able to learn,
Dr. William's <unclear></unclear>
by the King's indifference
<unclear>eaunnal</unclear> of less than 300,000.</p>
<p><unclear>Besides</unclear>which he has
been a sufferer from
defamation of character
and from <unclear></unclear> on
his life.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would
<unclear></unclear>of place for
<unclear> </unclear>to say how that I
have yet to hear one word 
of derogoration of his character
<unclear></unclear>
This among my acquaintances in
<unclear>Maritatime reunion</unclear>
Madagascar and <unclear></unclear></p>
<p><unclear></unclear>This were not the case.
I imagine that he would
long since have been
compelled to have retired
from the field.</p>
<p><unclear>Notwithstanding</unclear> that The
Department would give this
matter the attention to which
I believe it is entitled.</p>
<p>I have the right to be,
Sir,
Your Obedient Servant

<p>B. F. Wilson <unclear></unclear>, M.D.
of Johanna</p>

<p>Dear Sir,
Regarding your Claim against the King of Johanna
for indemnity for the loss you have suffered through his
interference with your labor supply during the past <unclear>four</unclear>
<unclear>years</unclear>, we can say that we are well aware of the serious
injury done to you and <unclear></unclear> by the large reduction in
the quanitity of <unclear>sugar</unclear>produced by Patsy <unclear>Estate</unclear>
from that interference.</p>
<p>It is quite certain that had the Sultan not 
compelled a large number of your laborers to leave your
employment with the object of crippling your operations,
you would at this time have been able to repay in the
important advances of funds we made to you through <unclear></unclear>
<unclear></unclear> for the purpose of working your <unclear>Estate</unclear>
Your claims for indemnity is therefore clearly just 
and indisputable, and we trust the United States Government
will enforce its payment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With reference to the representation which we
learn, have been made to your government by some evil
<unclear></unclear> persona, reflecting on your moral character, we cannot 
<unclear>only say they are false and malicious</unclear>.  During the last
ten years we have been intimately acquainted with you: we 
have therefore had every opportunity of observing your
behavior both here and in Johanna, and we <unclear></unclear> found
to say you have <unclear>invariably</unclear> conducted yourself as a <!--*3904-->
gentleman of irreproachable character.</p>
<p><unclear></unclear> Dear Sir,
Yours Faithfully,

<p><unclear>Domony</unclear>, Johanna <!--*3948-->
May, 1887</p>

<p>Dear Doctor Wilson,
Having been requested to act on an effort in
estimating the damage you suffered through the acts of Sultan
Abdallah, and being personally aquainted with the affairs and
also with the unwarranted conduct of Sultan Abdallah, toward you,
I hereby state my opinion in the matter.</p>
<p>I know very well that the Sultan threatened
your life by giving orders to his armed men to shoot you when 
they would get a chance of doing so; as you did not give
them the opportunity in your house through threats of being shot at,
prevented you from attending to the work of your plantation, as well
as to any other business you may have had in hand. I have seen
also in your house several places where the boards had been cut
through by bullets fired in the night and evidently intended for
you.  I know also of the scuttling and sinking of your
steam launch while at her ancorage, and of the stealing of anchors
and chains in your boat shed, all acts perpetuated by the Sultan's
men and by his orders.</p>
<p>Regarding your labour, it is very well known to me and
to every one in the island that in year <hi rend="underline">1883</hi> the Sultan took 
away some hundred free men who were working for you, and
gave orders to the Johannamen to withdraw from your employment
any all the slaves they had in it.  This taking place while
you were in full <unclear>crop</unclear> interfered, not with that crop, but with
those that followed, as it prevented you from doing your planting
and many other important works.</p>
<p>From the quantities of sugar you made during the
preceding years, that is from 1879-1882 included, it is evident
that during that period your crops were increasing by about
one hundred tons every year.  In the year <hi rend="underline">1883</hi>, time of the 
Sultan's interference, you made only <hi rend="underline">half</hi> the quantities of sugar
of the preceding year or <hi rend="underline">three hundred tons less</hi> than you should
have made had you not been interfered with by the Sultan.
The following years, 1884-1888, show a slight increase <!--*4026-->
but not in a ratio with the first alluded to (1879-1882), and I should
say that in those last years (1884-1886), your yearly loss was 
as heavy as 1883, or about <hi rend="underline">three hundred tons yearly</hi> making
a total loss for the four years 1883-1886, of <hi rend="underline">twelve hundred tons</hi>, <!--I think this number is 1883, but he makes his threes look weird so I don't know-->
which, at the <unclear>Mauritius</unclear> market prices during these years would
be with, with interest, <hi rend="underline">Rs. 300.000.</hi></p>
<p>The above I consider to be as near as possible your losses
from the Sultan's interference with your labor in 1883 and 1884 not
speaking of the aforementioned attempts at your life, <unclear>&#38;c,</unclear> and
the general inconvenience you were you were <unclear>frat</unclear>to by such <unclear>unmanantable</unclear>
acts.</p>
<p>Trusting that the U.S. Government will give to your
case all the attention it deserves, and that you may some day
be compensated for your losses,
I remain, Dear Doctor,
Very Sincerely Yours

<p>Mohilla, October 15th, 1887 <!--*4115-->
Dr. Wilson M.D.
Patsy</p>
<p>Dear Sir,
In reply to your 
communication asking for any information
known to me concerning your late troubles
with the Sultan Abdallah and for which you are
claiming an indemnity, I can state that
your labor supply was almost entirely taken
away from you leaving scarely sufficient
people to gather in your crop, thus neglecting
all necessary work for <unclear></unclear> such as
planting, hoeing, &#38;c. Knowing as I do the
progress made in yields during the first ten years
cultivation of virgin land. I can assert that
your loss must <add place="above">have been</add>enormous.</p>
<p>From the bullet holes I have seen in your house
which were made by the Sultan's soldiers when
passing through your estate I consider your
life to have been in great danger. <unclear></unclear>
I know that it was to threaten that you
had to exercise great caution even in moving
round your house and entirely prevented
from attending to your <unclear></unclear> work. No one
can entertain any doubt about your
losses under such circumstances and
I hope that your Government will give
you the satisfaction you deserve as I
consider that you have been almost <unclear>ruined</unclear>
<unclear></unclear>been <unclear>wish</unclear></p>
<p>I remain
Your very sincerely

<p>To B. F. Wilson,
Proprietor of Patsy Estate
Johanna</p>
<p>Dear Sir,
Having been compelled by force when
imprisoned at <unclear>Baumban</unclear> by Sultan Abdallah to 
make a false statement concerning you. I now <!-- I think it's spelled Abdallah here, but I think either I am mistaking a's for u's, or it's spelled inconsistently-->
wish to declare and publish that that statement 
was false. It was written by Sultan Abdallah for
his own purpose and I was forced to sign it under
penalty of death if I did not. The statement
that he made me sign was that you had given
me money to have his men to go and fight for
Prince Mohammed <del></del> and that you would pay
ten dollars per head for slaves and fifty dollars for <!--- come back -->
free men and in case a slave died or was
killed you would pay fifty dollars to his master.</p>
<p>All this I now solemnly swear is false.
I wish here to state also I have often heard
Sultan Abdallah say that he intended to drive you
away from Johanna and take your planatation for
his own benefit and that of his own <unclear>son </unclear>. I have
heard him avow this intention many times
previous to the outbreak of trouble between him
and his brother, Prince Mohammed since
that occurred I was arrest and imprisoned
on <unclear>Baumban</unclear> because I sympathized
with Prince Mohammed although I <unclear></unclear>
for him nor visited him in any way <unclear></unclear>

<unclear></unclear></p>
<p>Dear Sir,
As you requested when I went to Johanna on behalf of
the Oriental Bank Corporation and the form of<unclear> Moudlette</unclear>
and report upon the Sultan's prayer estate at <unclear>Baumban ? </unclear>
<unclear></unclear> the estate "Patsy" belonging to Doctor Wilson. I found
Patsy estate very well managed indeed the eaves well cultivated,
and the plant of machinery in good order.  I should judge that
Dr. Wilson will this coming season turn out about you tons of sugar
and I see no reason why he should not go on increasing his 
production yearly, say from 70 to 100 tons until he makes 800 to 900
tons per annum. Dr. Wilson has done a great deal of hand and
intellectual work at Patsy, and it is my opinion that had his labour
<add place="side">supply</add><unclear></unclear>been interfered with by the Sultan since <unclear></unclear> (When he made
<unclear>527</unclear> tons of sugar). that he would have been making the 800 to 900 tons
annunally since <unclear>1870?</unclear></p>
<p>Doctor Wilson's losses from the cause above alluded to I
am sure cannot be less than one hundred <add place="above">thousand</add> pounds sterling, taking
into consideration the heavy fall in prices of sugar price that time,
interest, etc etc, besdies the lost of a certain quantity of cane abandoned 
and left in the ground, the latter taking from the <unclear></unclear> the necessary
properties for future cultivation of them.</p>
<p>The French Protectorate will I hope and trust work well
for future operations as there is an abundance of labour on the island,
and the men want to work, but as it appears were only deterred
from doing so by the Sultan who evidently does not wish to see <!--*4437-->
<unclear>success in his island. With the Protectorate he will not</unclear>
<unclear>be allowed to interfere</unclear></p>
<p><unclear>I do not consider that there is any risk whatsoever in
making advances to Wilson for working his estate.</unclear></p>

Sultan Abdallah insist upon Dr Wilson's paying him
interest for <unclear></unclear> that he had had from the Sultan
afrom the date they were retired until time of settlement,
had heard Dr. Wilson parted, but he had to give in to
the Sultan in order to come to some settlement with him.</p>
<p>It was well known that the Sultan had agreed to
supply Dr. Wilson with everything he required to make
a plantation without charging him anything
his plantation was paying. This was offered him for
the services he rendered to the Sultan Abdallah.</p>

<p>Johanna, 25 April 1886</p> <!--*4527-->
<p>Dr. B. F. Wilson has made <unclear></unclear> tons of sugar in 1882. At the
commencement of the 1882 <unclear></unclear> he was deprived of labor by
Sultan Abdallah, as that he could not extend his plantation,
and it has been <unclear></unclear> the same every year since that time
(1882) so that instead of increasing his production of sugar
yearly as he might have done had he had the required labour,
it has fallen off, so that his last crop was only 227 tons;
whereas he might have made, if not interefered with, 900 tons of 
sugar the last season: the estate being able to produce about
1500 tons of sugar, if all is put under callibration.</p>
<p>It is a very easy matter for a crop to be largely reduced by
want of labour during one season: but it is very difficult, and
requires much time to increase it again. It will take Dr. Wilson
at least four years to get his production of sugar what it
would have been had he not been interefered with.</p>
<p>I have had much experience on sugar plantations, being an
agricultural chemist, and I consider myself well able to judge 
in this case, having spent <del>the</del> last twelve years in sugar
colonies.</p>
<p>Another important consideration in connection with Dr. Wilson's
losses is the fall in the price of sugars for the last two years,
which has been more than 30%; so even if Dr. Wilson can
produce the same quanitity of sugqar as he had been able to 
produce before, he could not get the same profit.</p>

<p>Ten days ago, thhe U. S. S. Lancaster was here, Captain <!--*4747-->

I have been told to false statements against Dr. Wilson,
and placing him <unclear></unclear> false position: this letter,
bearign the signature of Prince M<del></del>hom<add place="above">m</add>ed. When Dr. Wilson
knew this he made some enquiries and learned positively
that Prince Mohom<add place="above">m</add>ed never write the letter referred to, nor
any other letter to Captain Potter, but that this letter was
written by a fellow <unclear>S. J.</unclear> Abdallah, by his orders, and <unclear>Sabeeh</unclear>
signed Mo<add place="above">m</add>ed. <unclear>Naming</unclear> got this information. Dr. Wilson
asked Captain Potter to send an officer with the letter to
Prince Mo<add place="above">m</add>ed to ascertain the fact. The "Lancaster" being
ready to sail and under steam no officer could go <del>out</del>
shore, and Captain Potter referred Dr. Wilson to the

a treaty with S. Abdallah.</p>

<p>Mauritius, August 1st, 1886</p>
<p>I hereby certify that I was in Dr. Wilson's employ on
Patsy Estate for six years, and I have heard Sultan Abdallah
say on several occasions that he intended after Dr. Wilson
had got his estate in good working condition to drive Dr.
Wilson from the island, and get his estate away from him
and give it to his son <unclear>Salim</unclear>. He also promised to make
one manage of the estate if I would assist in getting Dr.
Wilson into difficulties. I am personally acquainted with
Sultan Abdallah, and used to be very intimate with him.
He commenced to try and deprive Dr. Wilson of labour in
1882 and took away all his own slaves first from Dr.
Wilson, and then of his Queen <unclear>Baney Malala</unclear>, about 60 in
number.</p>
