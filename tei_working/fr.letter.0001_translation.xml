                    In your previous letter from July 31st,
                    you wanted to tell me
                    that you were completely in agreement with
                    me in looking over the costs of the
                    new mission that you are proposing
                    to charge Mr. D. Bayol of the occidental 
                    coast of Africa, to become, in
                    principal, incombent upon you <supplied>Administration</supplied>
                    but that you unfortunately found yourself <!-- 'malheureusement was originally hyphenated and split between 'malheureu' and 'sement' -->
                    in the impossibility of coping
                </p>
                
                <ab>
                    Mister Etienne,

                </ab>
                
                <note>

                    with the means of gathering the expenditure
                    that you are managing. Consequently,
                    you are now expressing the hope
                    that it would be possible for me to remove
                    from the special funds of the Minister
                    of Foreign Affairs, the order 
                    of 20,000 frs necessary for the success of
                    the mission in question, by adding
                    what you need, in this case, <unclear/>
                    to take the commitment of reimbursing
                    this advance later on for my
                    Department.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I hasten to inform you that
                    I could only, to my strong regret,
                    maintain the conclusions of the letter
                    that I had the honor of adressing to you,
                    on this subject, on July 28th. The
                    special funds that you are managing are
                </p>
                
                <pb facs="20160613_105501.jpg"/>
                
                <p>
                    hardly sufficient for the objects
                    to which they are assigned and I 
                    could not embezzle <unclear>a sum</unclear>
                    that important <unclear>faces<unclear> running the
                    risk of compromising the interest
                    that I am more particularly
                    held to protect ./.
                    
                    Accept, Mister Undersecretary
                    of State and Dear Colleague, the assurances
                    of my highest Consideration
