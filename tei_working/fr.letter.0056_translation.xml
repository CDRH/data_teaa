<unclear/> to independence
<supplied>Liberia</supplied>
</ab>

<p>
<del>Over the course of the month of August 1849</del> The
colony of Monrovia, founded, on the west coast
of Africa by a piety of the American Union,
to serve as a second homeland for the africans taken by
the slave traders by American cruisers and, in general
for all, colored men from the United States, declared
itself independent of this society and <unclear>s'été</unclear> <unclear/>
the State <unclear/>, under the name of Republic of
Liberia.
</p>

<p>
<del>At the same time</del> A constitution, noted, the preceding 
July 29th, <unclear>for</unclear> for the representatives of the colonies, was
<unclear/> with precision. <unclear>A</unclear> virtue of this fundamental coast,
the executive power of the new republic must
be composed of a President and a Vice President,
<unclear/>, in a unanimous vote, for two years. The legislative
power resides in two <del><unclear/></del> assemblies, the senate
and the chamber of representatives.
</p>

<p>
In a first <unclear/>, held in Monrovia
<del>de</del> during the months of January and February 1848,
the Senate and the Representatives  <unclear>renduit</unclear> a certain
number of decrees. <del><unclear>dont il qui laquelle</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear/></del> nous en <del><unclear>être</unclear></del> mention nous

<p>
<del><unclear>La</unclear> <unclear/></del>The one, qui brings the date of <unclear>January 28th 1848</unclear>,
decides that the commerce of all the nations <unclear>will make<unclear/>
a treaty with the most complete equality, and
be un full possession of the same privileges and of the same protection
in the whole extent of the territory of the republic.
However the republic reserves it to be modified later
on. If there is place, this disposition, </unclear> the
treaties of commerce.
</p>

<p>
The other decree, returned on the date of February 1st, contains
the description of the limits of the new State. <unclear>There is</unclear>
said that the territory of the republic spreads over the entire
line of the coast included between the big <unclear>Cape</unclear>
monte,in the north west, and the <unclear>big letter</unclear> in the
south east, in expectance however of some points <unclear/>
of little importance.
</p>

<p>
On September 2nd 1847 the government of Liberia
officially notified Mr. Chaigneau, french lieutenant
cammander of war bougainville, in 
station at this point, the declaration of independence
<supplied>colony</supplied>, <del>de <unclear/></del> and <del>it</del> addressed, <del><unclear>to the</unclear></del> to this officer, a counterpart of
the constitution and a map of the territory of the
republic.
</p>

<p>
In transmitting <del> <unclear/> <unclear/> </del>these documents to the minister
of the navy and the colonies, Mr. Montag niés of the
Rogue, <unclear/> commander of the french naval
division employed at the repression of the treaty of the
<unclear/>, informed that , already, the commodore
</p>

<p>
Hoham, chief of the english station on the
west coast of Africa, gave the order
to the one <del><unclear/></del> of the british cruisers to
recognize the republic of Liberia, and to
recognize the flag. The commodore <del> who <unclear/></del>
placed at the head of the station of the United States, had
made the same manifestation.
</p>

<p>
As for the commander of the french division
he<unclear>remained on</unclear> the reserve and he demanded the
instructions of the gouvernement.
</p>

<p>
There could be a difficulty to raise before
all. Here is what it consists of: on the map <del><unclear/></del>
<del>au <unclear>capitain</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear/></del> of the territory of the
republic that was <unclear/> to captain chaigneau,
there are three points on which France has the rights
à faire voloir: The includes: l'<unclear/> <unclear>of the fishermen, situated</unclear>
near the big <unclear>Baffa</unclear>; the big Boutul and
<unclear/>. These last two <unclear>en clares</unclear> can not
make the subject of an expected contestation that the
government of Liberia recognizes that it <supplied>belongs</supplied>
to France.# But the position of the <unclear/> of the <supplied>Fishermen</supplied>
<unclear>is</unclear> different. This little territory is under the domination
of the Chief Big Water, with whom we made a 
treaty, <del><unclear>and</unclear></del> who <unclear>considers</unclear> it as submitting to France,
who declares to not want to accept the sovereignty <supplied>of</supplied>
the republic of Libreria.  On its side the <supplied>government</supplied>
of this State pretends that the territory, occupied by <unclear>Big</unclear>

1836 by the force of arms.
</p>

<p>
The question is to know if it is in our interest
to maintain our rights on the angle of the Fishermen
Mr. Montagniès of the Rogue <unclear/> that this point is
advantageuous, either for forming there a deposit of coal
or for founding there a <unclear>factory</unclear> <unclear>Il a jointe that we</unclear>
must not abandon the points that belong

<del><unclear/> <unclear/></del> keep these <unclear>divisions</unclear> as
means of engaging the government of Liberia to
favorably treat our commerce.
</p>

<p>
Mr <unclear>Captain of vailleou Bouet Willamez</unclear>, in the special
light of who the department of the navy 
appealed, thinks that our rights of property and of <unclear/>
on the three points designed above, are certain
but, in his opinion, rather than contrasting
rigorously our rights with the government of
Monrovia, maybe it would be preferable to
not trouble it in the action <unclear>civilisatrice</unclear> that it
is exercising on the coastline under its authority.

<p>
Citizen minister and dear colleague,

The colony of Monrovia, founded in June
1822, on the west coast of Africa, by an
american society, to serve d'<unclear/> the
men of color liberated in the United States,
declared itself independent of this society, in
august 1847, and constituated itself as a sovereign state,
under the name of Republic of Liberia.
</p>

<p>
The following September 2nd, the government
of Liberia officially notified Mr.Chaigne,
commander of the french war ship,
Bougainville, in station at this point, the
declaration of independance of the colonies; and
he <unclear>addressa</unclear> at the same time to this officer a counterpart of the
voted constitution, the preceding July 29th, and a
map of the territory of the republic.
</p>

<p>
In transmitting, on February 29th 1848, these documents
to the minister of the navy and the colonies, the
commander of the french naval forces on
</p>

<note>
fr.
</note>

<pb facs="20160613_162610.jpg"/>

<p>
the west coast of Africa informed that
the commodore Hotham, in the name of the British
government, and the american <del>english</del> officer, placed
at the head of the station of the United States recognized
the republic of Liberia and that they gave
the order to recognize its flag.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Montagniés de la Roque abstained
from making the same manifestation until he
had received the instructions of the government.
</p>

<p>
My opinion is that there is place to prescribe à son
<unclear>successor</unclear> Mr. le cape. de vaisseau Boudin to
proceed immediately with the recognition of
the new republic. Mr. Montagniés de la
Roque only saw one difficulty with that. It consists
in what the chief of an African village, isolated
in the limits of the territory of the republic, 
concluded, in 1848, with the officer who cammanded
the french station, a treaty in vitue of which
this chief considered as the subject of France and
declared to not want to <del><unclear/></del> accept the
laws of the government of Liberia.
</p>

<p>
I do not believe that there are <del><unclear/></del>  reservations <del><unclear/></del>
to make on the subject of this incident. The government of Liberia
fills, on the African coast, a <unclear/> of
civilization that it is dignified of the french republic
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_162617.jpg"/>

<p>
to encourage. Furthermore <del><unclear/></del> the interest <del><unclear>under command</unclear></del> of our commerce
to enter, without delay, in official relations with
this state so that the governments of England 
and America do not make the accord at all, in
our absence, of the commerical privileges that will not
be equally accorded to us. Last the reminder of the predicament <del>qu</del> that we aroused <del>à la politique</del> on the coast
<del>french</del> of africa the enclaves such <del><unclear>que</unclear></del> as Albréda,
<unclear>en Porterdick</unclear> <del><unclear>et</unclear></del>, must, it seems to me, move away from us
to do nothing <del><unclear>puis pas</unclear> <unclear/></del> that could appeal to us,
<del><unclear>gratuitement</unclear></del> the difficulties of the same war.
</p>

<p>
I urge you, citizen minister and dear colleague
<del><unclear>des</unclear> <unclear/> <unclear/></del> to inform me of your opinion on
the question. If you think, like me, that there <del><unclear>est</unclear></del><unclear>y</unclear>
<del>argent</del> is place <del><unclear/> <unclear/></del> to recognize the
republic of Liberia, <del><unclear/></del> I would be obliged to you
to <del><unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/></del> <del><unclear>mal écrire</unclear></del> <unclear/> me the <unclear/> that you
<del>so that I can give, without delay, the orders</del> <unclear>generation-must take with these words the commander</unclear>
