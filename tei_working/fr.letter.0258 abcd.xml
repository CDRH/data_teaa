<p>Legation of the United States
Brussels December 23, 1887</p>
    
<p>Sir:</p>
    
<p>In accordance with instructions from my
Government, I have the honor to bring to your
attention a case of flagrant wrongs, which
are said to have been inflicted upon the
American Baptist Missionary Union,
composed of American citizens, and engaged
in missionary work in the Congo Free State by
Officials of the State. </p>
    
<p>It appears from a letter addressed by the 
Reverend A. Billington, representative of the
Union at Stanley Pool, to the American Consul
at St. Paul and Lounds a copy of which I enclose 
herewith, that the Union owns a small Steamer on</p>
    
<p>To Mr. Edmund Van Ectvelde
General Administrator of the
Department of Foreign Affairs and of Justice
of the Independent State of the Congo</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>on the waters of the Upper Congo, called the
"Henry Reed" for the purpose of conveying Missionaries
and their goods to its Stations. That in April
last Mr. Henry M. Stanley arriced at Stanley 
Pool, and applied for the use of the Steamer
but that the circumstances or the missionaries
were such that they could not do as he wishes,
that he - Stanley - thereupon in the most 
arbitrary and lawless manner attempted
to take the Steamer by force, by placing an
armed band at the entrance of the Mission
Station, and another at the place where the
Steamer was at anchor, and then sent 
a letter demanding the instant surrender
of the Steamer; in case of non-compliance
his officers had orders to enforce the demand
at any risk either to Mr. Billington or those
concerned. That before anything was done,</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>the Chief of the Station of the Congo Free State at
Stanley Pool protested against Mr. Stanley's
action in the name of the tate, and the armed
forces were withdrawn. The Chief of the Station
then applied for the Steamer, but the circumstances
remaining unaltered, the missionaries were
obliged to refuse its use. That it however
became so clear to them from conversations
and correspondance, that the Steamer would
be taken, that they ultimately handed her
over to the authorities of the Free State under
protest, for Mr. Stanley's use for the space 
of 45 days.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that while the
Chief of the Station ostensibly protested against
the threatened violence of Stanley is evidenced
by his posting on armed force at the entrance 
of the Mission, and another at the place </p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>where the Steamer was at anchor and
his unwarranted and insolent demand
for the instant surrender of the private property
of these missionaries, yet it is entirely apparent
from the Statement of Mr. Billington that
he aided and abetted Stanley in his
lawlessness, and that these missionaries
were obliged to deliver their property up to
the authorities of the Free State for the use
of Stanley because they could not help
themselves.</p>
    
<p>But another an still more serious 
and flagrant wrong to these missionaries
by persons connected with the Government
of the Congo Free State remains to be stated.</p>
    
 <p>It seems that the steamer was kept
 considerably beyond the 45 days by the</p>
 
<pb></pb>
 
<p>Legation of the United States of America
Brusels 1887</p>

 <p>Stanley, and then where she had been sent
 away by him to be returned to her oweners,
the American Baptist Missionary Union,
she was seized before reaching Stanley-Pool
by another officer of the Free State. </p>
 
<p>This seizure was made at Bangala by
Lieut <unclear>Vangele</unclear>. This officer, it appears, first
applied for the use of the Steamer of the English
Baptist Mission, she being there at the time
but on being refused he at once marched
20 armed soldiers on board the "Henry Reed".
His action was protested against by some of those
in charge of the Steamer but <unclear></unclear> effect
and up to the 3rd of August - the date of the 
letter - she had not been returned to her
owners.</p>
 
<p>Assuming the facts to be correctly </p>
 
<pb></pb>
 
<p>stated, and there seems to be no present reason
to doubt that they are. I desire most earnestly
to remonstrate in the name of my Government,
against the arbitrary and lawless acts of 
interference with the enjoyment of the rights 
of private property by the persons connected
with the Government of the Independent State
of the Congo, as  indicated by the circumstances
I have detailed. </p>
 
<p>The Goverment of the United-States
could not fail to regard with profound regret
and displeasure such abuses of the rights
of any of its citizens in the Congo Free
State by officials of the State, and especially
in the case of the unselfish and selfsacrificing
men, who, braving the dangers of climate
and the <unclear>pirations</unclear> incident to a savage</p>

<pb></pb>

 <p>unsettled country, have posted themselves 
 there as aids of humanity and religion.
 No settlers could be more valuable to the
 Government of the New Country in its efforts
 to spread the blessings of civilization, or are
 entitled to greater protection and more tender
 consideration at the hands of the Governmental
 authorities than the brave and singleminded
 men and women who are occupying the
 field of the Congo State as missionaries <unclear></unclear>
no missionaries more than those who go
 from America. They go from, and are citizens
 of a country, whose Government was the
 first to recognize the Congo flag, and which 
 has been unfaltering in its sympathy
 and aid to towards the establishing of a
 liberal and civilized Government in</p>
