<p>This article from the Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Afro-American</hi> praises Ernest J. Lyon, the United States envoy to Liberia, for graciously welcoming a commission sent from the U.S. to Liberia. Liberia was facing external threats to its sovereignty from neighboring European colonial powers, and Lyon was a "crucial liaison" between Liberia and the United States Government. The article alludes to the visit of Roland Falkner, George Sale, and the African American Emmett J. Scott, recommended by Booker T. Washington. The men were sent by President Taft to assess the difficulties in Liberia. The country was in dispute over its boundary with the neighboring colony of Sierra Leone, governed by Britain. It looked to the United States to assist in settling those issues, help pay off some of its loans, and to help train a frontier force. The commission was welcomed by Liberian citizens, and Scott, in particular, was singled out for praise.</p>

<p>Lyon was a diplomat at a particularly difficult time. In 1905, the French began to encroach on Liberian territory, the country was facing a weak currency crisis, a national deficit and trouble paying back loans to European banks, as well as having to deal with conflicts between its indigenous population and the Americo-Liberian settlers. He advocated on Liberia's behalf, urging the U.S. Government to intervene and support the country financially. In asking for U.S. intervention in Liberia, Lyon stressed ancestral ties between the two countries. He extolled the strategic benefits to the U.S. of continued engagement with Liberia and to see it as a foothold in Africa. He privately wrote to Booker T. Washington in 1906 to intervene with the U.S. President and to rally support for the African nation.</p>
