<p><hi rend="italics">Chants for the Boer</hi> is a book of verse by Western American poet Joaquin Miller. Published in 1900, in the midst of the Second Boer War in Southern Africa, Miller's poems voice a popular position in the United States: full-throated support of the Boers&#8212;"so like ourselves a century back"&#8212;against the British. He concludes "To the Boers," for example, with the rousing cry, "Give her such welcome with such will/As Boston gave in battle's whir/That red, dread day at Bunker Hill." In his preface, Miller includes a quotation from a letter by Herbert Spencer, in order to demonstrate that many British subjects also opposed the actions of their government. Among the poems found in Miller's book are "Usland to the Boers ["Usland" being Miller's acronymic neologism for the U.S.]," "Fight a Boy of Your Size," and "To Oom Paul Kruger, on his Seventy-Fifth Birthday." Not all of the poems included in the book, however, address the Second Boer War; "Mother Egypt" criticizes England's occupation of Egypt in a manner similar to Miller's "Africa." Of Egypt, he writes, "If she be dead, respect the dead ... She suckled at her tawny dugs/Your Moses while you reeked in wars/And prowled your woods, nude, painted thugs." On the subject of modern black Africans, including those affected by the Second Boer War, Miller is silent.</p>
