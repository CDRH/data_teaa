<p>Anna Boardman Smith was a missionary stationed in Africa from 1902 to 1914 at the Kunso Wesleyan Mission and Kono Station in Sierra Leone. She wrote a narrative about her time in Africa to not only "increase...interest in foreign missions throughout" her denomination, but also to target American Christian women specifically. She wrote: "O happy Christian women of America! Can we not do something to lighten the loads of our overburdened sisters in this darkened land?" (183). Smith traveled to Africa with her first husband Willard Boardman, who died at the mission from "a common attack of African fever" (43). She and Willard had both attended the Wesleyan-affiliated Houghton College in New York and evangelized together for three years before they traveled to Africa. After Willard's death, Boardman married another missionary, J. Hal Smith, while at the mission. Smith used her narrative to provide information about specific African peoples, mostly the Temne and Limba, and to persuade her Christian readers that there were "jewels" (converts) to be "gathered" in Africa as a whole, which required evangelists willing to live in—not merely visit—the continent for some considerable amount of time. Smith ended her narrative with "A Plea for Africa," replete with racist, denigrating images of Africans as "heathens" and Africa as "pathetic beyond description" (273). She vouches that everything she has witnessed, felt, and heard in Africa—as relayed in the narrative—is true. Thus, she argued that "God needs our best for Africa" (275). Smith's appeal replicated that belief found in many American and European missionary narratives, which claimed the redemption of Africa could only commence through the continent's Christianity. This was also a refrain in contemporaneous imperialist literature about Africa.</p>
