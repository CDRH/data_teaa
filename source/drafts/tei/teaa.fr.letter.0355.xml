<p>Legation of the United States of America</p>
    
<p>Brussels 4 February 1888</p>

<p>Sir:</p>
    
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the reception of your esteemed note of the
28th ultimo which I have read with
interest.</p>
    
<p>You therein confirm what I supposed
would be the case, that your Government
and mine, are in entire accord on the
point that the General act of the Berlin <fw type="catch">Conference</fw>
    
<fw type="footer">Mr. Edmund Van Eetvelde
Administrateur General of the
Department of Foreign Affairs
etc. etc. etc</fw>
    
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.002.jpg"/>
    
Conference opens to the flags of all
nationalities without distinction, free
access to the navigation of the Congo
and its affluents, whether parties to 
the Convention or not.</p>
    
<p>We equally agree on the general 
principle that the enforcement by the
State through which a free river flows, 
of police regulations, with a view to the
preservation of public order and the
protection of pubic health, within its
territories, is not inconsistent with the
enjoyment of the free use of the river for 
the purposes of navigation, trade and
commerce. I am not able to see <fw type="catch">however</fw>
 

however that the demand on the part 
of such State that foreign vessels traversing
free waters, shall display the flag of
the State, or that the authorities of the 
State may properly exercise the right
of deciding upon the sufficiency of the
papers on board establishing the vessels'
nationality, as a pre-requisite to her
flying another flag than that of the
riparian State, is in any sense, a police
regulation. If this demand is founded
on law, the principle in this instance, 
must be sought for discretion than in
the right to make and enforce police
regulations.</p> <fw type="catch">Nor</fw>
 
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.003.jpg"/>
 
<p>Nor am I prepared to admit,
while fully recognizing the benevolent
and kindly motives which activate
the authorities of the State, that the
freedom of navigation of the water of 
the Congo, is assured, when the undisturbed
enjoyment of this right can
be obtained for foreign vessels, only
on the condition of flying the flag
recognized or respected by the people
of the riparian State. It is possible
that such vessels might be more free 
from danger, but if they are obliged,
for any reason, to conceal their own
flag or hoist the colours of the
 
 
riparian State as a condition to the
navigation of these waters, dedicated to
the free commerce of the world, it is
evident that the navigation would not
be free in point of fact, no matter
whether all nations without distinction
were subjected to the same terms.</p>
 
<p>It is quite true that is happens
every day that foreign vessels hoist at the
foremast, as a matter of courtesy, the flag
of the nation whose ports they are entering
or departing from, but I believe it will
clearly be seriously contended that the
extension of a courtesy, for however long
a period it may have been practiced <fw type="catch">constitutes</fw>
 
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.004.jpg"/>
 
constitutes a sufficient basis for the
assertion of an absolute right.</p>
 
<p>So far as the question of law is
concerned, it being conceded that the
Congo river and its affluents are free
waters, and open to the commerce
of the world without distinction of flag,
it seems to me it must inevitably
follow, that wherever a vessel may
go, she may carry the flag of the
nationality of which her owners are
citizens, and that she is not bound
to carry any other flag. Indeed,
as a general rule, the display of the
flags of two different nations on the <fw type="catch">same</fw>
 

 
same vessel, renders her liable to
suspicion, and even puts in doubt her
nationality. This principle is not
in conflict with municipal laws requiring
the display of quarantine flags, pilot
ensigns etc, which do not claim to be
flags of nationality.</p>

<p>I regret that I am not able
to concur with you, on the question raised
as to the right of your Government to 
determine upon the sufficiency of the
papers on board of a vessel, to establish
its nationality.</p>
 
<p>There could be no better illustration
of the danger of the exercise <fw type="catch">of</fw>
 
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.005.jpg"/>
 
of such power by the authorities of
one state of the vessels of another,
than that which is furnished in your 
own communication, to which I am
now having the honor to respond.</p>
 
<p>You have therein kindly
called my attention to Section 226 
of the Consular Regulations of the
United States of 1874, as evidence
that only vessels registered at a Custom
House may carry the American flag.</p>
 
<p>It is quite natural for foreigners
to fall into ever in construing the
meaning and effect of the local 
regulations of another country, because
they cannot be expected to be familiar <fw type="catch">with</fw>
 

 
with the history of such regulations, the
circumstances which precede their adoption,
or the purposes to be subserved
in controlling or directing the agents
of the Government.</p>
 
<p>Without entering into any explanation
at length, of the section of the Consular
regulation to which you have referenced,
I present to you at once, the best evidence
possible that you have misapprehended
the section you have quoted. Intended 
as it was, chiefly, to put a stop to the
practice which had grown up with 
our Consuls, of issuing certificates of
ownership to vessels - a practice <fw type="catch">clearly</fw>



<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.006.jpg"/>
 
clearly unauthorized by law.</p>
 
<p>That you have misapprehended
its scope, you will readily see from
the terms of sections 338 and 339, to
be found in the Consular Regulations
of the United States of 1881 at page 54.</p>

<p>The sections referenced to, read as
follows:</p>
 
<p>Section 338. "The right of
American citizens to acquire property
in foreign ships has been held to be
a natural right, independent of
Statutory law, and such property is
no more nor less entitled to protection
by the United States, than any other
property of an American citizen."</p>
 

 
<p>Section 339. "The existing
General Regulations of the Treasury
Department, under customs and
navigation laws (Customs Regulations
of 1874) recognize the right of property
in vessels of this character, and declare
them to be entitled to the protection of
the authorities and to the flag of the
United States, although no register
enrollment, license or other marine
document prescribed by the laws of 
the United States can lawfully be
issued to such vessels whether they
are American or foreign built.</p>

<p>The former practice of issuing <fw type="catch">Sea-letters</fw>
 
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.007.jpg"/>
 
Sea-letters in the case of the purchase
abroad of American or foreign vessels
by citizens of the United States, is no
longer authorized and will not be
permitted."</p>
 
<p>I have already explained
in my communication of the 9th ultimo
that America vessels may be either
registered or unregistered.</p>
 
<p>A registered vessel is one which is
built in the United States and wholly
owned by citizens thereof.</p>
 
<p>An unregistered vessel is one not
built in the United States but wholly
owned by citizens thereof. <fw type="catch">While</fw>
 


While registered vessels, with the view of
encouraging ship building, are entitled
to certain privileges and exemptions not
extended to unregistered vessels, both are
nevertheless entitled to carry the American 
flag, and to claim the protection of
the Government.</p>
 
<p>The registration of vessels is
a matter of local or municipal
regulation, differing in different countries.
I am not aware of any rules of international 
law which required a ship to have a 
register, or any other document expressive
of her national character.She may
plough the sea and other free waters, <fw type="catch">of</fw>

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.008.jpg"/>
 
of the world, without the possession of
any such papers, and cannot be
lawfully disturbed, so long as she
is engaged in peaceful pursuits, and
molests no one. The flag which 
she carries is the symbol of her
nationality, and it is prima facie
evidence to the world of the national character of 
her owners, just as a register, sea letter
or other document is. True ownership 
of a vessel is a matter in pais, to 
be proved like any other fact. It
may be shown by a bill of sale, the
ordinary instrument used for the
purpose of transferring property in <fw type="catch">a</fw>
 


a ship, or in the absence of a bill
of sale, it may be shown by parol
testimony.</p>
 
<p>On the other hand, as a national
flag is prima facie evidence in free
waters, that the nationality of the ship
carrying it, corresponds to that of the
flag. So under well established principles
of law, if a vessel is navigation under
the flag of a foreign country, she is to
be considered as bearing the National
Character of the Counter under whose
flag she sails. She makes a 
part of its navigation, and is in
every respect liable to be considered <fw type="catch">as</fw>
 
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.009.jpg"/>
 
as a vessel of the country.</p>
 
<p>Thus it is apparent under the
rules of law, that if the decree of the
30th of April requiring vessels to hoist 
the flag of the Congo State is enforced,
it invests the authorities of the State
with the power of making a prima
facie transfer of foreign vessels,
without the consent of the owners, to
the Marine of the Congo State. I 
am not able to find any warrant
in the law for the exercise of such
a power by the State.</p>
 
<p>While my Government watches
with the deepest interest and sympathy <fw type="catch">the</fw>
 

the progress which is being steadily made,
by the royal and illustrious founder of
the Independent State of the Congo,
in giving to that land, the blessings
of Civilized Government, and fully
appreciates that the Government which
he guides, has the loftiest purposes in
view, and fosters no aims, which are 
not conceived with the intention of
advancing the highest ends of Good
Government, it yet esteems it a duty,
that it should not, by its silence,
sum to accent to a proposal, to
inflict a fine on an American vessel,
which fails to hoist a foreign flag <fw type="catch">on</fw>
 
<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.0355.010.jpg"/>

on waters, which without distinction,
are free to the flags of the world.</p>
 
<p>I avail myself of the 
opportunity to renew to you Sir,
the assurances of my most distinguished consideration</p>
 
<p>Lambert Tree</p>
