<p>Consulate of the United States
of America at Sierra Leone<lb/>
22nd March 1862.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to forward to 
the Department of State by the 
bark "Orlando" of Boston, Sparks, 
master the local Ordinances of 
the colony of Sierra Leone up to 
the 31st December 1860. These properly, 
should have been forwarded 
through the acting U.S. Consul 
at Gambia under whom, I at 
present hold my appointment, 
but as the only communication 
between this port and the Gambia 
is through the English mail 
packets, I thought I should be 
justified in forwarding direct 
to save expense.</p>

<p>I desire most respectfully to 
<catchwords>lay</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon. William H. Seward<lb/> 
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</fw>

<pb n="55"/>

lay before you the following request 
and earnestly hope that it may 
meet with your favorable attention; 
it is that I may be appointed 
Consul of the United 
States for this Colony and its 
dependencies, and receive a commission as such.</p>

<p>The following are my reasons 
for wishing this appointment, the 
French and Spanish consular officers 
now in this place arrived 
here as vice consuls, about the 
time I received my commission 
as consular agent, which was in 
the month of September 1860, I 
was recognized by the Governor 
of the colony as vice consul of 
the United States, and consequently, 
was on an equal with
those gentlemen as regards rank,
subsequently, however, both gentlemen 
have received commissions 
from their respective governments 
<catchwords>appointing</catchwords> 

<pb n="56"/>

appointing them consuls, with 
salaries, to the French consul
including fees about £900, and 
to the Spanish consul £1000.</p>

<p>The acting consul at Gambia 
is an Englishman, there being no 
American in that place, I am 
an American, native born, 
my birth place being Salem, Massachusetts. 
I have been a resident 
of this colony for about three 
years and expect to remain 
here a number of years longer, 
such being the case it is very 
unpleasant to hold an inferior 
position in the service of my 
own Government subject to an 
Englishmen holding a superior 
office, more especially as the 
English generally, at the present 
time, are not disposed to be 
very friendly towards our 
free Northern States.</p>

<p>Sierra Leone has a population 
of about 45,000 souls, and is frequently 
<catchwords>termed</catchwords>

<pb n="57"/>

termed the Metropolis of the west 
coast of Africa, and commercially 
it is an important and rising 
place, the Americans do a large 
business here and there are frequently 
from eight to ten American 
vessels in the harbor, Gambia 
is a small place of about 4000 
inhabitants, with very little 
American commercial intercourse.</p> 

<p>Port Praya, Gambia and Liberia all 
places of less importance have superior 
consular officers.</p>

<p>Should the appointment be 
given to me, I shall pay the 
strictest attention to all the duties 
required of me, having an earnest 
desire to increase the commercial 
importance of our country.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your most obdt servant<lb/>
Henry Rider<lb/>
U.S. Consular Agent</p>
