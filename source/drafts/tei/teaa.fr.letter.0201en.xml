<p> No. 16
SUBJECT:
Letter report on the 
Tshela route to Lukula by
Maba</p>

    <p> Mr. Commissioner General</p>
    
    <p> I am honored to bring to your attention that I have 
        returned to Lakula by the Maba, Leange, Tuidi Zambi and
        Punze chiefdoms. I took this journey, following the declarations of
        Chief Thomas Lutete during his visit to Tshela. </p>
 <p> In his chiefdom, he would have recieved Mr. American Consul, accompanied by
     the Vungu Missionary acting as an interpreter. </p>
    <p> The latter asked throughout his travels, in what
        way they manage their territory and moreover, how many times the            chiefs whipped the natives when they did not pay their tax. </p>
    <p> The Agents of the Colonies equally posed relative questions to the          recruitment workers.</p>
    <p> I pointed out to Thomas Lutete the gravity of his declarations
        and he told me to keep them.</p>
    
    <p> He has furthermore, as well as the decorated chief Paoli de Moduda,
        the intention for this motive; to return to Boma next. He complains
        equally of the name Thomas Dedé, cathéchiste of the Kinkenzi mission,
    who authorizes a lot of abuses in his chiefdom and to recognize 
    his authority of being a decorated chief.</p>
    
    <p> A lot of indigineous subchiefs having complained about it
        he askes me if you could not send him a magistrate, in order for
        all men to see reason for once. There is a question of the
        chief's arrest for the settling of accounts then a judgment
        arrived in a palaber by the name of Thomas Dede, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Commissioner General</p>
<p>commissioner of the district of Bas-Congo</p>
<p>Boma</p>
