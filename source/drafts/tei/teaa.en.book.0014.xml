<p>The Continent of the Future</p>

<p>Africa and its Wonderful Development&#8212;Exploration,
Gold Mining, Trade, Missions and Elevation.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The tide of modern civilization and religious development
is sweeping round the globe. With the rapid advance of India,
the unparalleled strides of Japan, and the steady progress of China to
the new era, Africa is about to reveal its long-kept secrets and its possibilities
of contributing to the elevation of its inhabitants and the
welfare of the world. Commerce, capital, science, philanthropy and
religion have joined hands to penetrate the mysterious land and cast
light on its gloomiest portions. Africa is very nearly everwhere regarded
as the continent of the future.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENTAL.&#8212; France seems about to absorb Tunis and Tripoli,
and to unite Algeria to her Senegal possessions. The Chambers
have voted eight millions of francs ($1,600,000) for two railroads: (1)
from Algiers to Timbuctoo, across the Sahara, and (2) from Saint Louis,
Senegal, to Bamaka and Sego. Two millions of francs ($400,000) have
also been appropriated for the construction of a telegraph line from
Dakar to Saint Vincent, to place Senegal in telegraphic connection
with Europe. A loan is proposed of forty-five millions of francs ($9,000,000)
for the formation of three hundred villages and the introduction
of two hundred thousand colonists into Algeria. This expanding
colony is just fifty years old. In 1830 the total exports and imports
did not amount to two million francs ($400,000.) They have 
now reached three hundred and sixty-five million francs, ($63,100,000.)</p>

<p>M. Soleillet and M. Doponchel give the result of their long and
thorough <sic>reconnoissance</sic> as highly favorable to the project of crossing
the Sahara by steam, and they describe the desert as far more fertile
than is commonly believed. The latter says: "What is being so
successfully accomplished by England in India, by the United States
in North America, and by Russia in Central Asia, that should we try
to do in emulation of their example&#8212;seek a continent whereon to
extend our beneficent influence, and find, by the employment of our

<pb xml:id="p002" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.002"/>

idle capital, at once a new market for the products of our industries
and manufactures, and a vast centre of agricultural production, able
to supply us, at small cost, with the raw materials not indigenous to
our soil, which we now only obtain with difficulty from foreign sources.</p>

<p>The expedition under Gallieni is stated to have reached Saint 
Louis from Timbuctoo, having completed a survey for a railroad between
those points which is pronounced to be entirely feasible. He 
met with a friendly reception, and formed treaties with numerous 
tribes, whereby France is granted a right of, way, and may establish
ambassadorial or military representatives at the proposed principal
stations. M. Matheis has been commissioned by the French Government 
to explore the country from the bend of the Niger to Lake
Tchad. M. L. Vassian, an attache of the French Department for Foreign
Affairs, is to reside for a time at Khartoum, to study the nature of 
the commercial relations to be formed with Soudan.</p>
 
<p>At a conference at Paris in relation to the territories between Sierra
Leone and the Gambia, it is understood that the decision reached 
was that the French are to retain the Mellacouri and the English the
Scarcies. The newly appointed Governor of Sierra Leone, Arthur Elibank Havelock, Esq., was one of the representatives of the British
Government at the conference.</p>

<p>Portugal is actively caring for her extensive African domain.
The Governor-General of Angola has been directed to organize a system
of colonization in that province, by selecting a region best adapted
for its salubrity, fertility of soil, abundance of water and facility 
of communication, and to prepare accommodations for one hundred 
colonists and their families, an emigration having begun from
Madeira. Lorenzo Marquez, the port of Delagoa Bay, has been ceded 
to Great Britain. It is the best harbor on the south-eastern coast, 
while its geographical relation to Natal, Zululand and the 
Transvaal makes its possession of importance to England. 
The latter guarantees to Portugal the exclusive right to the 
territory between the Ambriz and Congo rivers. The concession made 
by the Portuguese Government to the Andrada Land Company, extending 
from the Shire to the Kafrio, at Nyampanga Island, about 
seven hundred miles, is in course of examination by a party of French
mining engineers. The Commercial Association of Lisbon is raising 
funds by subscription to be offered to the Government to co-operate 
with it in the foundation of civilizing stations in the Portuguese African colonies.</p>

<p>Spain is meditating a protectorate of Morocco. Messers Bolliglia,
Mamoli and Pastori, of the "Italian Society for Promoting Commercial

<pb xml:id="p003" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.003"/>

Exploration in Africa," have left Tripoli to examine the elevated
plain of Barka and to found trading posts at Bengasi, Derna and Tebreck,
and afterwards others on the oasis bordering the road to Uadai
and Bornu. The Italian Government has contributed generously to
outfit the expedition. The same Society has dispatched M. Demeitri
and M. Michieli from Khartoum for the Red Sea, with a caravan 
of seven hundred camels laden with various kinds of merchandise
for trade. The Egyptian Government has sent the learned Rohlfs to
the King of Abyssinia to arrange mutual relations on a friendly basis.
The Sultan of Zanzibar has engaged the intrepid Thomson to conduct 
a geographical investigation of the Rovouma.</p>

<p>THE SLAVE TRADE.&#8212;It is estimated that fifty thousand natives 
are annually conveyed to the Turkish and Egyptian ports of the Red
Sea, where they are disposed of to dealers. The Sultan of Zanzibar 
has dispatched an armed force of five hundred men, commanded by 
an officer detailed from the British Army, in the direction of Lake
Tanganyika, and the British Government is to establish consuls at
Suakin and Khartoum, with authority to travel in Egypt and on the Red
Sea, "to heal the open sore of the world." The French Government is 
to make earnest efforts and to co-operate with England in all measures
having in view the same humane object. The Khedive has appointed 
Comte Della Salla to the special office of repressing the 
slave traffic in lower Egypt. It is to be regretted that at the Berlin
Congress in 1878, which afforded an excellent opportunity for concerting
a treaty on slavery between the Powers of Europe, this good 
result was rendered impossible by the action of the English representatives.</p>

<p>EXPLORATIONS.&#8212;In the exploration of Africa the Germans keep
the lead, of which almost nothing is known until they appear after
an absence of a few years, with a fund of knowledge that is astonishing.
Witness, for instance, the apparition of Lenz from a journey 
from Morocco to Timbuctoo, and thence to Medina and St. Louis. 
This famous traveler reports passing through towns of from ten 
to thirty thousand inhabitants, and of having made discoveries which
explode the theory of converting the Sahara into an ocean. He states
that the most depressed portion of El Juff, the body of the desert, is
some five hundred feet above the level of the sea, and that there
exist in several oases points which promise to be of great utility for the proposed Sahara railway.</p>

<p>Dr. Pogge is penetrating the country inland from St. Paul de Loando,
the German Government having asked for him the protection 
of the Portuguese Government in its African jurisdiction. Dr. Holub,

<pb xml:id="p004" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.004"/>

who has made interesting researches on the Zambesi, intends to cross 
the continent from south to north. Starting from the Cape of Good 
Hope he is to strike the Zambesi, thence the watershed district between
that river and the Congo, and on to Egypt through Darfur.</p>

<p>Dr. Stocker is exploring Lake Toana. M. Piaggia is traversing Soudan,
south of Khartoum, between the Blue and White Nile, M. Lombard, corresponding secretary of the Normandy Society of Geography, 
has entered on a scientific mission to Abyssinia. M. J. Chouver, 
a Hollander of fortune and experience as a traveler, has reached the
Galla country on his way to the Cape of Good Hope. Capt. Ferreira,
Governor of Benguela, and several officers of the army, have offered
their services to the Geographical Society of Lisbon for a Portuguese expedition across Africa, starting from the West Coast. M. Antusa 
is organizing a commercial station at Zomba, where he is to be joined 
by workmen whom the Portuguese Government has promised to furnish 
to erect buildings. The learned Dr. Schweinfurth has returned 
from a visit to the Island of Socotra, off the coast of Aden, and affirms
that it is very fertile, with a splendid and varied vegetation. One-fourth of its plants are peculiar to the locality.</p>

<p>M. Moustier, who in 1879, with M. Zweifel, discovered the source 
of the Niger, is again to start from Freetown on a trading venture and 
to fix the exact geographical position of " the rise of the mysterious river." 
Lieut. Dumbleton and Surgeon Browning, R. A., are in charge of
an expedition to penetrate, by the Gambia, into the valley of the
Niger to Timbuctoo. Dr. Gouldsbury lately led an exploring
party from the river Gambia, via Timbo and Port Lokko, to Sierra 
Leone, the outlay for which from the colonial treasury was 
Â£2,400, ($12,000.)</p>

<p>THE CONGO.&#8212;The illustrious Stanley has reached his second station on the Congo, Isangila, about 30 miles above Vivi, which point
was gained only after faithful but weary toil, and against every kind
of difficulty. He was obliged to throw bridges across the streams, 
open, hatchet in hand, a route across dense forests, blow up rocks;
leading the way with a group of pioneers, and after advancing a 
little, to make a halt, pitch a camp, then go back to bring by instalments 
the rest of the convoy, till all were united. Count de Brazza 
has ascended the Ogowe to its headwaters, reaching thereby
the sources of several of the affluents of the Congo. Descending
one of these, the Alima, partly along the shore and partly by 
boats, he struck the Congo below Stanley Pool, and coming down 
the river he met Stanley, It is suggested that a more practicable
route to the interior than that by the lower Congo may be opened by

<pb xml:id="p005" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.005"/>

the Ogowe and the streams which rise near its source. The Count is 
again to descend the Alima, this time in a transportable steam launch,
and then to make a thorough examination of the valley of the Congo
&#8212;the area of which is estimated to be four times that of France.</p>

<p>TELEGRAPHIC.&#8212;Telegraphic communication has been established
 between Elmina and Cape Coast. The Portuguese Commissioner of 
Public Works has constructed in Angola a telegraphic line from St.
Paul de Loando to Dondo and Calcullo. Preparations are making
for its extension. The French Government proposes to connect Tunis
with Corsica by cable. A third cable has been laid from Marseilles to
Algiers. A second telegraphic line is in operation between Algeria 
and Tunis.</p>

<p>GOLD MINES.&#8212;Six companies are working on the Gold Coast
with encouraging prospects. Improved machinery has been shipped
by the African Company, and its mine is reported to be one of extraordinary 
richness. The success of the Gold Coast Company places it 
in the highest rank of gold mine enterprise. At meetings of the Effuenta
Company (July 7 and 21) resolutions were adopted to create an 
additional two thousand shares of Â£5 each, ($25,) to be distributed
among the existing shareholders proportional to their present holding.
The number of shares applied for was more than double the 
amount to be issued. The Akankoo Gold Coast Company&#8212;a new
organization&#8212;has acquired territory on the borders of the river Ancobra, 
and the celebrated Cameron has been engaged to open up the 
property. The British authorities have placed a civil commandant 
with a police force at Tacquah. Much of the delay experienced in 
the production of the precious metal is attributed in some cases to error
of management, perhaps unavoidable, and in all to the many difficulties
encountered in an almost unknown region, with the additional disadvantages of a very unhealthy climate for Europeans.</p>

<p>FINANCIAL.&#8212;A prospectus has appeared for the establishment of
"The Bank of West Africa," capital ,Â£500,000, ($2,500,000,) in fifty
thousand shares of Â£10 each, ($50.) The chief office is to be in London,
with branches at Sierra Leone and Lagos. The shares of the 
Standard Bank of South Africa, Â£25, ($125,) paid, are quoted at 57, 
and the dividends paid for the last two years have been sixteen per
cent. Postal money order offices have been opened between Sierra 
Leone and the Gambia, at the rate of three shillings (75 cents) per
Â£10, ($50.)</p>

<p>COMMERCIAL.&#8212;Africa contains resources upon which large portions
of the enlightened world will in no very remote future be dependent, 
and it possesses the very highest capacity for the consumption

<pb xml:id="p006" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.006"/>

of many of the productions of civilization. One of the marked
developments is the numerous orders for utensils and simple machinery 
of various kinds, to be worked by hand or with light power, and 
for mechanical tools and agricultural implements. The business is 
already extensive and is likely to be of immense magnitude. Dr. Holub
describes Prince Sechele, chief of the Bechuanas, as living in a 
grand abode, which he had erected in European style, at a cost of $15,000. 
Khartoum is making astonishing progress. Magnificent stores 
have been built within the last three years, and everything in modern
civilization can now be had there. The Northwest Company is extending
commerce at Cape Juby. The security afforded since 
the "annexation" by England of Lagos has powerfully helped 
it to become the "Liverpool of Africa." The declared value of its exports
in 1878 was Â£577,346, ($2,886,730.) The number, tonnage, &amp;c, 
of steam vessels which entered Lagos in the same year is thus given:</p>

<p>"The Lagos Warehouse and Commission Company," capital Â£50,000,
($250,000) in Â£5 ($25) shares, has been formed, for the purpose of
founding a wholesale warehouse at Lagos, and, when desirable, at other
important points on the West Coast. Thus a native merchant will
be put in possession of two thirds of the net value of his consignment
immediately the Company is in possession of his produce, and he will 
be enabled to have all his produce realized in the home market.</p>

<p>STEAMERS.&#8212;Twenty-five years ago it took a passenger from the
United States one hundred and thirty days to reach Corisco; now a
trip via Liverpool of about a month, in a palace compared with the
pent-up quarters of a sailing ship, and tables furnish with luxuries instead 
of ringing the changes of salt beef and hard bread from day to 
day. Twenty-eight steamships afford weekly communication between
Liverpool and the West Coast. The vessels of "the African Steamship
Company" are named as follows: Africa, Akassa, Ambriz, Benin, 
Biafra, Ethiopia, Landana, Mayumba, Nubia, Opobo, Whydah and 
Winnebah, and those of "the British and African Steam Navigation 
Company" bear the following names: Benguela, Bonny, Cameroon,
Congo, Corisco, Dodo, Forcades, Formoso, Gaboon, Kinsembo, Loando,
Lualaba, Ramos, Roquelle, Senegal and Volta. "The West African 
Steam Navigation Company" also employ a number of steamships

ships in the West African trade. Messrs. Rubattino &amp; Co. announce
their intention to put on several steamers between Genoa and Bengasi.
Not a steamer from the United States to Africa!</p>

<p>A company has been formed in New York for "the establishment
of a line of steamships for passengers, mail and freight, between New
York, Madeira, St. Thomas and Teneriffe, Cape de Verde, the Western
Islands, the Canary Islands, and the ports of the West Coast of
Africa." The capital stock is $100,000; and may be increased to $4,000,000;
shares $100. Such a line would open cheap and rapid communication
between the Liberian Republic and our own, furnishing
facilities for the thousands of people of color who desire to obtain an
expansive field for their energies, and bringing to our market the valuable
staples of its productive soil. In relation to this important project
an experienced missionary writes: "Often, during these twenty 
years, I have been surprised at the apparent indifference of American
capitalists and ship owners to the share that they might have obtained
in the profits of the African trade, other than slaves. I have 
seen two English lines of steamers (the South and the West, having 
their termini respectively at the Cape of Good Hope and the mouth 
of the Niger) develop by rich opposition to five, and the termini of
three of them extended from the Niger down to the Congo-Livingstone,
and literally every nation of Europe engaged in their profits, 
while America has scarcely a showing." A subsidy or liberal legislation
by Congress is counted upon before additional steps in this enterprise
are taken. And among other public action tending to success is the
creation and appointment of consuls at the Gold Coast, Lagos and
Bonny; and vice-consuls at smaller points between Monrovia and the 
Niger, to be under the supervision of the Minister Resident to Liberia.</p>

<p>RAILROAD SURVEY.&#8212;While the United States flagship Ticonderoga,
Commodore Shufeldt, was on the West African coast, two of her 
officers, Lieut. Drake and Master Vreeland, assisted by eleven men
from the ship and twenty-seven natives furnished by the Liberian
Government, made a survey of the St. Paul's river, and ran a line of
levels along its northern bank and some distance inland, to determine 
the feasibility of constructing a railroad to connect Monrovia with 
the Soudan Valley, via Boporo. This <sic>reconnoissance</sic> proved that the
engineering difficulties would be comparatively trifling. There is no
doubt that Monrovia would be the most available point for the
starting of such a road, as it would pass through an entirely virgin
country and penetrate to a salubrious region, whose resources for 
trade, known to be prodigious, are as yet untouched. Such a connection
with the interior, with the various appliances of civilization

<pb xml:id="p009" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.009"/>

which must follow would be one of the most effective agencies for
promoting vigorous colonization, of the immigrants, who would at 
once reach a healthy and fertile district, and would prove great
practical power in the advancement of missionary work, and immediately
become an important auxiliary in developing and <sic>controling</sic> an 
immense and valuable commerce.</p>

<p>This <sic>reconnoissance</sic> was the first made in that quarter, and it has 
done much toward bringing the interior tribes into commercial and
friendly relations with the Liberians. Other surveys were conducted 
by the same bold and public-spirited officers, including that of the
Sugaree and Marfa rivers. The presence of the Ticonderoga and Commodore
Shufeldt will long be pleasantly remembered, and good 
continue to result. This accomplished officer, in letter dated April
1881, remarks: "In view of the many failures which have been recorded 
in every age of the world, Liberia may be regarded as success. 
* * * This, the first effort of the African race to establish a
free government upon its own soil, merits and should receive the
sympathy and encouragement of every man, woman and child in America."</p>

<p>LIBERIA COFFEE.&#8212;The species of coffee which indigenous to
Liberia promises to have an important influence on the industry of 
those countries in which the coffee blight has almost extinguished the
Arabian coffee plant. In Dominica, W. I., the Liberia coffee, from seedings planted in 1874, has proved impervious to the ravages of the blight, and its productiveness matter of astonishment. The 
stranger described as "much larger than that of Arabia, being, indeed,
in its native state small tree, its leaves much larger the berries 
are twice the size of the ordinary coffee bean, and the
flavor is excellent." The Liberia coffee seed has been introduced
into Ceylon, and Liberian coffee from that isle commands much 
higher price than the Ceylon, (Arabian) coffee. The bark Elverton
took from Liberia to Rio Janerio some one hundred 
thousand coffee plants and fifty thousand pounds of coffee seed, 
and returning to Monrovia, readily obtained a similar cargo for the 
same parties in Brazil. A German trading firm extending the
coffee culture a short distance inland, near the Gaboon, with scions
procured in Liberia. The Republic in its infancy with regard to the
cultivation of the far-famed berry. The crop last year said to have
reached half million of pounds.</p>

<p>MOHAMMEDANISM.&#8212;Enthusiastic propagandists of Islam, without
commission or compensation of any kind, but trusting wholly to that
hospitality which the pride of the Oriental, pass from village to village

<pb xml:id="p010" facs="teaa.en.book.0014.010"/>

reading the Koran and giving instructions to wondering groups 
of natives. Whole tribes are stated to be converted to the Mahommedan
faith. The eminent scholar and writer, Rev. Dr. Blyden,* says: 
"Africans are continually going to and fro between the Atlantic Ocean 
and the Red Sea. I have met in Liberia and in its eastern frontiers,
Mohammedan Negroes born in Mecca, the holy city of Arabia, who thought they were telling of nothing extraordinary when they were detailing the
incidents of their journey, and of the journey of their friends, from the
banks of the Niger&#8212;from the neighborhood of Sierra Leone and Liberia&#8212;
across the continent to Egypt, Arabia and Jerusalem. I saw in Cairo 
and Jerusalem, some years ago, West Africans who had come on business 
and on religious pilgrimage from their distant homes in Senegambia." 
The promoters of Christianity are using these native travelers 
and missionaries of the false prophet. Copies of the Holy Scriptures 
in Arabic, printed at Beyrout, are sent to Egypt and for circulation 
in the Delta and along the valley of the Nile, and to Liberia, whence
they are distributed among the inhabitants of vast outstretching 
realms whose vernacular is the Arabic.</p>

<p>POPULATION.&#8212;The population of Africa, exclusive of its Islands,
is estimated by Dr. Behm, in Peterman's "Mittheilungun," at 201,787,000.
Of these the number of Protestant communicants in the various 
colonial and mission churches was reported in 1880 as 122,700; the 
number composing the communities connected with these churches 
506,966; the number of Jews, 350,000; of Coptic, Abyssinian and similar
Christians, 4,535,000; of Mohammedans, 51,170,000; of heathen,
145,225,000.</p>

<p>To carry the gospel to these millions, sixty four societies are at
work. In South Africa and the colonies and Sierra Leone and Liberia 
there are connected with colonial churches 468 ministers, evangelists 
and teachers, of whom 54 are natives. The other white missionaries 
and teachers on the continent, are reported as 662, with 1095 
natives, making 1757 mission workers proper, and 2,255 ministers,
missionaries and teachers of all kinds, engaged in religious labors.</p>

<p>The population of Liberia, including Medina, may be 1,400,000. 
The largest proportion of the natives are Mohammedans, perhaps 
1,000,000. There are 26 Baptist churches, reporting 24 ministers and
1,928 communicants. The Protestant Episcopal Church of the United 
States reports one bishop and 31 others, missionaries, teachers and
assistants, 361 communicants, 597 Sunday-school scholars and 415 in
