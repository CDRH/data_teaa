S.E. the Cr Walewski a P.E. Admiral
Hamelin.
</ab>

<ab>
January 21st 1859
</ab>

<p>
Mr. Admiral C.C. you, by
your letter from the 18th of this month,
expressed to me the desire to be fixed on
the expanse of coast under the
jurisdiction of the Republic of
Liberia and on the precise limits
that in the actual state the treaties
the government of the Emperor recognized
in this state. I hasten to
inform you that my Department
does not possess any information
on this subject that I can transmit
to you. There was not until now,
in effect, in that which concerned it
directly, any motive to preoccupy
it with this question of
limit. The government of the Emperor
concluded, without doubt a treaty with
the Republic of Liberia; but
this convention was only
for the objective of regulating our reports
of commerce and navigation
with this state and no circumstance
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_162748.jpg"/>

<p>
brought us to research on 
this occasion what were the
limits that it was suitable to assign 
to the Republic of Liberia.
If it had been otherwise, at a different time,
your Department would have
been informed like mine,
since it is by the intermediary
of the Governor in chief of our
station of the West coast
of Africa, Mr. Captain of
vaisseau Baudin that was negociatd
the treaty signed in Monrovia
on April 20th 1852 upon my
proposition by the Emperor
and ratified on October 18th 1856. The
only document that the Minister
of Foreign Affairs has relatively
on this question of limits is
a letter that you did me the 
honor of writing yourself
on July 11th 1857, without the stamp
of the Direction of the Colonies
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_162754.jpg"/>

<p>
to signal to me the exterior
that seemed to want to take
the Republic of Liberia and
the inconveniences that you saw
there for us as well as
for Great Britain.
I had believed the obligation to these remarks,
and according to what you wrote to me,
to provoke on this question
the opinion of the English Governor, but
he abstained from formulating
any opinion. You
indicate yourself, in surplus,
in the letter that I have just
recalled which seem to you
to be the legitimate limits of
the Republic of Liberia.
I only knew to refer myself
to these indications that your
Department is surely by the
reports that reach it
the most likely to furnish
than that of Foreign
Affairs.
