Grand Bassam, January 29th 1894

The Governor to Mister

<p>
Mister Under Secretary of State,

I have the honor to address to you hereinafter
the information that you
demanded from me on the application in the
Colony of the Act of the Conference of
Brussels, in execution of the act. 82 of
the precited act
</p>

<p>
The application of the dispositions of the Act
of Brussels in that which concerns the treatment
of slaves is equally better obeserved,
than in the territories of the Côte d'Ivoire
slavery
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_153724.jpg"/>

<p>
slavery does not exist. The administration
only intervened over the course of the year<!-- 'l'année' is split across lines between ' l' ' and 'année' -->
1893 against the isolated acts that
only consisted in excess of protection that
some indigenous pretended to exercise towards
the domestics or isolated peoples that
wanted to distance themselves against the convenience of their masters.
</p>

<p>
On the interior, the Colony established posts
of Administrators on the Lahou and the Comsè,
and none of these people had the occasion
to signal to me throughout the year of 1893
the reports of the selling of slaves.
</p>

<p>
The Government of the Côte d'Ivoire
equally established throughout the year
posts of administrators and of customs officers
on all of the coastline between Fresco and the Republic
of Liberia. In view of predicting the illegal
engagement of negroes on the part of the Côte said of
Virou, the local government assured the
regulation; and the depart of the workers of this
coast is put under control of the Administration
No
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_153731.jpg"/>

<p>
No engagement illicits a little thus occurs.
</p>

<p>
The establishment of these diverse posts was equally
for effect of submitting <unclear/> the <unclear/> to Jeu
to a control on this part of the coast like that which already existed of the <unclear/> <unclear/> in Fresco on all
the arms apart from the <unclear/> in <unclear/> my <unclear/>,
and the ammmunitions apart from the <unclear/> of treatment
are banned in the Colonie.
</p>

<p>
It only made <unclear>exceptions</unclear>in favor of
some notable persons who were authorized
to <unclear/> hunting weapons <unclear/>
<unclear/> <unclear/>. The number of these authorizations
did not <unclear/> 20.
</p>

<p>
In that which concerns the alcohol in the <unclear/> <unclear/> H9o
the only one who could <unclear/>, the rights rose
to 0.60 per liter. They were sufficiently
risen to prevent that this commerce did not
take a more <unclear/> <unclear/>.
</p>

<p>
I am with a profound Respect,
Mister Under Secretary of State,
Your very obedient server
<unclear/> <!-- Signature -->
