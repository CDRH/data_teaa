                    Mister Admiral and dear colleague,
                    
                    I have the honor of informing you that
                    Mr. William A. Garesché has just been named
                    Consul of the United States in
                    Martinique. I hasten to address to you,
                    following custom, the exequatur addressed to Mr. Garesché
                    and I will be obliged to you to send to him
                    this unit and inviting Mr. Governor
                    of Martinique to take the necessary measures
                    so that this officer is admitted to free exercise of
                    his duties.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Mr. Minister of the United States of America

                    the necessary instructions to Mr. Governor
                    of Senegal so that this officer may be recognized in
                    the said quality and admitted to stand in for the Consul,
                    Mr. Pierre Strickland, in case of absence or
                    impediment.

                <p>
                    I have the honor of informing you as well
                   that Mr. Le Roy, Consul of Italy in St. Denis (Reunion),
                    having been obliged to leave this colony for reasons
                    of health has just resigned from his duties. The
                    Italian government has the intention to name,
                    in replacement of Mr. Le Roy, Mr. Chrétien
                    (henri), french citizen, born in St. Denis, July 27th
                    1855, and who already filled the roll of Vice-Consul
                    with this consulat. However, before making
                    a decision in this regard, and by demand of 
                    <unclear>S. Epec.</unclear> Mr. Ambassador of Italy in Paris, I will
                    obliged to you to tell me if by his social position
                    and by his morality, Mr. Chrétien would be worthy of taking on
                    the duties for which he is designated and if Mr. 
                    Governor of the Reunion has any objection to 
                    raise against his nomination.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Accept, Mister Admiral and dear colleague, the
                    new assurances of my highest consideration.
                </p>

                    For the minister, by authorization
