Mr. Alby, Manager of the Vice-Consulate <!-- 'Vice-Consulat' is split across lines between 'Vice-' and 'Consulat' -->
of France in Freetown (Sierra-Leone)
to Mr. Develle, Minister of Foreign
Affairs. Paris.
</ab>

<ab>
Freetown (Sierra Leone), July 21st 1893
</ab>

<p>
I had the honor to report
to V.E. in a letter from the
12th of July, of the existence on the
territory of Sierra Leone of an
american mission that projects
to grow its establishments
into our new possessions <!-- 'possessions' is hyphenated between 'posses-' and 'sions' -->
of Sudan - Here is the complementary<!-- 'renseignements' is hyphenated between 'ren-' and 'seignements' -->
information that
I could obtain on this subject.
</p>

<p>
"The American Sudan Mission"
after unfortunate temptations. 
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121541.jpg"/>

<p>
A few years ago, there was
founded in the "International
Missionary Alliance" which has its
headquarters in New-York. Its Superior
Mr. E. Sampson, General
Superintendent, has just made a trip
around the world in the interest of the
development of this association.
He has not yet returned
to New-York, but he assured me
that he passed the Tonking
where it is of question to establish a
mission
</p>

<p>
The mission established in
the Colony of Sierra-Leone is
in very good terms with the Anglican
Bishop of Freetown and the other
religious sects that proliferate there.
"The American Sudan Mission,"
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121550.jpg"/>

<p>
still designed without this name
to distinguish it from the other
branches of "the international
Missionary Alliance" counts
twenty missionaries for this
Colony; on this number, six are
on leave in America, the
other fourteen, are distributed,
without the direction of Mr. H.W.
Hubby, in the diverse establishments <!-- 'établissements' is hyphenated between 'établis-' and 'sements' -->
of Sierra Leone.
</p>

<p>
Three are in convalescence in
Freetown, the others are in
Mahera, in Magbele and in Magbeu-Kete, <!-- 'Magbeu-Kete' is hyphenated between 'Magbeu-' and 'Kete' -->
little towns or villages
situated on the banks of the
Rokelle River. Magbele indicated
on the map under the name of
Mabelin, and in the official
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121601.jpg"/>

<p>
documents under the name of Magbelli,
(A map of Sierra Leone and
neighbouring Territories For use
in Schools 1887 - 51 South Castle
Street. Liverpool) counts, they say,
6,000 indigenous habitants, whom
would be nearly three times more than any
count of our villages of
Guinée. - There is not a post
office. - It is the limit of
navigation in vapor on the
river Rokell, that upstream from
Magbele takes the name of Magbele. <!-- 'Magbele' is hyphenated between 'Mag-' and '-bele' -->
</p>

<p>
There is thus one of
these missionaries in Rokonson,
or Kounson, a village near which
is found a very important
farm belonging to a
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121606.jpg"/>

<p>
missionnary of another sect,
named Mr. Johnston, one <unclear/>
coffee, <unclear/>, and millet in rather
large quantity.
</p>

<p>
The mission of Sierra
Leone proposes to  <unclear/> in
the next season <unclear/> until
 <unclear/> of Niger, then to descend <!-- 'descendre' is hyphenated between 'descen-' and '-dre' -->
the river until  <unclear/>,
and even farther,
founding stations there where this
will be possible.
</p>

<p>
In its beginnings, about five or
six years ago, the mission
lost nearly all of its members
by default of the experience of the country
where it was searching to install itself;
today it is more
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121616.jpg"/>

<p>
satisfied with the obtained results.
It expects to have next year <!-- 'prochaine' is hyphenated between 'pro-' and '-chaine' -->
a little steamer that
will be charged with stocking it
and facilitating its communications
by the Rokell-the biggest
difficulty being there, as in
all of the colonies of the west coast <!-- 'occidentale' is hyphenated between 'occiden-' and '-tale' -->
of Africa, to procure the
necessary supplies to those that
can nourish themselves exclusively
with rice or millet; furthermore, the
unhealthy parties of this territory
being those that neighbor the mouth
of the rivers, as soon as
one finds themself at the altitudes of
one to two hundred meters, the climate
there becomes perfectly supportable
and just as healthy as elsewhere 
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121621.jpg"/>

<p>
under exceptional circumstances. These
considerations encourage the "American
Mission" to pursue its work of
penetration in Sudan. Its
members are people of a
certain instruction that do
topographic studies and possess
information of which I hope
to obtain the communication - it
seems that the precited map is
very inexact and it was given to me
as an example of the distance of
the route between <unclear>Magbele and Magbeu Kète</unclear>
which is 22 miles and that of
<unclear>RouKonson to Magbeukète</unclear> that
measures around 60 miles toward
the E.N-E - while the map
gives this last distance
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121704.jpg"/>

<p>
as sensibly shorter than
the preceding.
</p>

<p>
To return to the
"International Missionary Alliance",
this society would count around 170.
missionnaries, of which 20 in the
mission of Sudan; 30 in the
mission of the Congo, in the State
Belgium, but near the french
border, in Bouma and in Veva;
70 in the Indies; 4 in Palestine;
20/30 in China; some
in South America.
</p>

<p>
The action of these missionaries <!-- 'missionnaires' is hyphenated between 'mission-' and '-naires' -->
consists, they say, in the example <!-- 'l'exemple' is split across lines between ' l' ' and 'exemple' -->
of work, the austerity of the
customs, good behavior; their
means of progress, outside of
all political propaganda, are
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121709.jpg"/>

<p>
agricultural installations, farms,
cultures, foundation of families, good
relations with the Indigenous, etc . . .
On the side of this "American Soudan
Mission" it would have existed until
last year, on the base of Niger,
the "English Sudan Mission" that
tried to retake Niger in
leaving Lagos. But this mission
lead by Rév. Wilmot Brook,
without the high direction of the Anglican
Bishop Sierra Leone, was
abandoned in 1892, following
the death of Rév. W. Brook and
the majority of his companions.
One of them however,
retourned to England and
decided another Evangelic
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121727.jpg"/>

<p>
Association to take the suite
of this entreprise.
</p>

<p>
It is that who leads the
"American Mission" to think that
soon it will meet on
the Niger with the "English Mission."
</p>

<p>
These different attempts
of penetration of Sudan by
foreigners, to which title that
this be, appeared to be of the nature to
interest Your Excellence and
maybe you will judge Mr.
Minister, that for lack of french
agents in state of initiating the
indigenous of these distant regions <!-- 'lointaines' is hyphenated between 'loin-' and '-taines' -->
from our civilization, there
could be place to interest <!-- 'd'intéresser' is hyphenated between 'd'inté-' and '-résser' -->
to our cause or simply <!-- 'simplement' is hyphenated between 'sim-' and '-plement' -->
to favor those of
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_121738.jpg"/>

<p>
these Missionnaries that seem
by their origin and the neutral
character of their entreprise, the
more capable of us render
service, or at least to
not harm us./.
</p>

<note>
This guarantee does not
<unclear/> me. In <unclear/>
the<unclear/> foreign
always seems <unclear/>.

It <unclear/> to know first
if this american Sudan
Mission is not <unclear/>
