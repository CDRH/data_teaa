<p>
Mister Minister,

After having taken the opinion of the committees of commerce
of St Louis and Gorée, I submitted to the council the question posed
by your dispatch from the 11th <unclear>x</unclear> 1838 <unclear>110</unclear> 231. The councils, and the
majority of the council was of the opinion of<unclear/> of reciprocity towards
the Americans, and to put to a dollar per barrel the right
of average to perceive on their vessels. This opinion is not
my own, and here are the motives on which it is based.
</p>

<p>
It is not in the interest of the treasury that the American
Government stirked from the right of a dollar per barrel the french
vessels coming from Senegal. They receive so little from this
origin, that this augmentation of revenue can not be sensible.
The Americans displeased by that which we repel from
Sénégambie, wanted to use reprisals as much as they
could; they thought that to protect us from a costly
right, we would make some concession to them. The American
government will not reduce its right of anchorage, which is
not expected. The injust measures strains too much the reason for
which they are not first considered long and hard.
</p>

<p>
If we bear one franc, to one dollar the right of anchorage
in Gorée, it is not feared that the Americans augment
still that which they striked from our vessels: furthermore, the vessels of
the Union that do not release in Gorée unless to leave there a weak
part
</p>

<ab>
To His Excellence the Minister Secretary of State
of the Navy and the Colonies
