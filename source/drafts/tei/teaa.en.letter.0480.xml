U.S. Consulate
Sierra Leone, August 11, 1875

W.Hunter Aug 
Second Assistant Secretary
Department of State
Washington DC

Sir,
I had the honor to receive your dispatch No.3 dated June 30, a.c.m. questing me to transmit to your Department the statement of the aggregate of fees collected at this place for the year 1874. I regret that I am not able to comply with your request as during the time in question there was no Consular Officer of the U.S. here and consequently no entries whatever were made. For the future I shall not fail to fulfill the prescription of the Consular Regulations. 

I have the honor to be, Sir
Your obedient servant
WMandall
U.S. Consul
for Sierra Leone
