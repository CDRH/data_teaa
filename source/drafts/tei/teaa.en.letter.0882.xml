<p>Treasury Department<lb/>
Feb 10th 1862</p>

<p>Sir.</p>

<p>I have the honor to return herewith
the letter of C. P. Clark of 20th Ulto &amp; accompanying
papers, upon which you have requested my views.</p>

<p>I find by a reference to the correspondence
of this Department with the Department of State
that Mr Secy Cass on the 4 Feb 1859 addressed
Mr Secy Cobb, a letter requesting to know upon what
"terms Liberian vessels will be admitted into the
ports of the U States." Mr Cobb replied on 8th
Feb. /59 – "as the law now stands Liberian vessels
would be subjected in ports of the U States
to a duty of One dollar per ton, and their
Cargoes to a discriminating duty of 10 pr ct."
He adds–"Whether in view of the information

<pb n="Roll2-0027.jpg"/>

communicated by the US. Consul they should be
exempted from the discriminating duties of tonnage
and imposts, is for the President to determine
under authority conferred upon him by the 1st 
Section of the Act 24 May 1828." Mr. Cobb
returned the papers upon which this letter
was founded to your Department.</p>

<p>By the Act of 24 May 1828 (Laws Vol 4. p. 308)
where "no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost
are levied in the ports of any "foreign nation"
upon vessels of the US," the President of the
U States is authorized to issue his proclamation
declaring that the foreign discriminating duties
of tonnage and impost within the U States
shall be suspended, so far as respects the
vessels of said foreign nation and the produce
or merchandize imported into the U. States

<pb n="Roll2-0028.jpg"/>

in the vessels from said foreign nation"</p>

<p>Proclamations under this Act have been issued
by John Q. Adams, in behalf of Hanover, and by Andrew
Jackson in favor of Austria and Oldenburg.</p>

<p>I have no question that Liberia is de facto
a nation, and a "foreign nation": and so soon as the
act now before Congress shall have passed Liberia will
then be a nation within the provisions of the Act of 
24 May 1828. In the mean time it is perhaps, inexpedient
to raise the question whether Liberia, being already a
foreign nation within the equitable constitution of the
Act and imposing no discriminating duties on American
tonnage or imports, the President should, in absence of
formal recognition, issue the proclamation as in cases
of Hanover, Austria and Oldenburg.</p>

<p>With great respect<lb/>
S P Chase<lb/>
Secretary of the Treasury</p>

<p>Department of State,<lb/>
Washington, January 27, 1862.</p>

<p>Hon. S. P. Chase,<lb/>
Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Your letter of the 23d instant,
acknowledging the receipt of C. P. Clark's
which had been addressed to this Department,
and enclosing another letter form
Mr. Clark, addressed to you, has been received.</p>

<p>In regard to the papers which Mr.
Clark requests you to obtain from this
Department, the one first mentioned merely
contained a printed copy of a message
from President Benson to the Legislature
of Liberia, which has been mislaid, but a
new copy of which has just been procured
and is herewith transmitted to you; the second
(of 23d August, 1859) was never received;
and the third and last (dated 5th November, 1858)

<pb n="Roll2-0019.jpg"/>

was sent to the Secretary of the Treasury
in a letter from this Department of 4th February, 1859.</p>

<p>I beg leave to suggest that all
the additional information desired may
be found in the Report of the Foreign Commerce
made by the Secretary of State for 1858–
Part 2d of Ex. Docs. No. 4, H.R., 36th Congress,
1st session, pp. 207, 208, and 287, and also
in the similar Report for 1860–Part 2d of
Ex. Docs. No. 6, Senate, 36th Congress, 2d Session,
pp. 171, 172, and 238.</p>

<p>Mr. Clark's letter to you is herewith
returned.</p>

<p>I am, sir, your obedient servant,<lb/>
F. W. Seward,<lb/>
Acting Secretary</p>
