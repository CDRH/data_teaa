<p>Sir.
I have the honor to

(3) Records of official
official</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1267.jpg"/>

<p>Official fees (4), Miscelleneous
expenses with vouchers (5)
and General, account (6)</p>

<p>Permit me to express my
deep regret that I have not
forwarded these returns in
regular order (quarterly): My
reason for not doing so, was
that Mr. Taylor requested me
not to, until his return,
which would have been before
the ending of December quarter,
last, according to his arrangement,
and not until I had
entered upon the quarter ending
this date did I hear of his
resignation did forwarded
my Bond.</p>

<p>I have put no house
house</p>

<p>rent in the account, but there
is one quarter <unclear></unclear> Mr Sharp,
to date: having no authority to
settle same. I have requested
him to await until I can
get advice in reference to the
matter.</p>

<p>I have further to state in
explanation of my account
record, that the bill of Mr. R. A.
Sherman, is for landing the case
Stationary to consigned to the
Legation when Mr. Taylor was
in charge, which was claimed
to the Leeward, and landed a
few days after Mr Taylor's
departure. The Bill of Messers
G. Moore &amp; Son is for <unclear></unclear>
whichever necessary to be

<p>be had for the cleanliness of, and
light for safety of the Legation.
The two boys Thomas Robeik,
and Wanjeh Lan's were left at
the Legation by Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>I trust my report will be
in order and satisfactory, as
Mr. Taylor left the Legation to
return in two and a half months,
and matter very scattered and
aukward.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir
Your very obedient Servant</p>

<p>Beverly Y Payne.</p>
