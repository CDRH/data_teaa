<note>Department of State Received May 5 1888</note>

<p>No 7.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States.<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, March 31, 1888.</p>

<p>Mr. B. Y. Payne to the Assistant
Secretary of State</p>

<p>Subject.</p>

<p>Returns for Quarter ended
March 31st 1888.</p>

<p>Sir.</p>

<p>I have the honor to
respectfully transmit the
following as my returns or
<unclear>report</unclear> since my incumbency
October 1887 to date, which
consist of Digest of Invoice
book (1) of Arrivals and departure
of American vessels (2)
Summary of Consular business
(3) Record of official
<catchwords>official</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1267.jpg"/>

official fees (4), <sic>Miscelleneous</sic>
expenses with vouchers (5)
and General account (6)</p>

<p>Permit me to express my
deep regret that I have not
forwarded these returns in
regular order (quarterly): My
reason for not doing so, was
that Mr. Taylor requested me,
not to, until his return,
which would have been before
the ending of December quarter,
last, according to his arrangement,
and not until I had
entered upon the quarter ending
this date did I hear of his
resignation, and forwarded
my Bond.</p>

<p>I have put no house

rent in the account, but there
is one quarter due Mr Sharp,
to date: having no authority to
settle same, I have requested
him to await until I can
get advice in reference to the
matter.</p>

<p>I have further to state in
explanation of my account
rendered, that the bill of Mr R. A.
Sherman, is for landing the case
Stationary &amp;c consigned to the
Legation when Mr Taylor was
in charge, which was carried
to the Leeward, and landed a
few days after Mr Taylor's
departure. The Bill of Messers
G. Moore &amp; Son, is for sundries
which ever necessary to be
<catchwords>be</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1269.jpg"/>

be had for the cleanliness of, and
light for safety of the Legation.</p>

<p>The two boys Thomas Roberts,
and <unclear extent="one name"/> were left at
the Legation by Mr Taylor.</p>

<p>I trust my report will be
in order and satisfactory, as
Mr. Taylor left the Legation to
return in two and a half months,
and matters very scattered and
awkward.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your very obedient Servant<lb/>
Beverly Y Payne.</p>
