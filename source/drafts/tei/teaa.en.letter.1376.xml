<note>Department of State Received Nov 21 1881</note>

<p>No. 84.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the U.S.,<lb/>
Monrovia, La, Oct. 4, 1881.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Smyth to the<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Annual report for the Liberian fiscal year which ended September 30, 1881.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>

<p>Characteristics of Liberian coffee, imports and exports, and tonnage of American vessels.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-2404.jpg"/>

<p>No. 84.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the U.S.,<lb/>
Monrovia, La, Oct. 4, 1881.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to submit the within paper "Liberian coffee Its characteristics &amp;c &amp;c", No. 1, prepared by my request–as contained in enclosure No. 2; and Liberian exports and imports, No. 3; for the <sic>the</sic> Liberian fiscal year which ended Sept. 30th, 1881.</p>

<p>I had hoped to furnish as an annual report, a full and exhaustive statement as to Liberian agriculture, but have to regret that I have been unable to do so.</p>

<p>I indulge the hope however, that this paper upon Liberian coffee, the result of the long experience <catchwords>of</catchwords> 

<fw type="address">Hon. R. R. Hitt,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-2405.jpg"/>

of a coffee grower, of a gentleman of scientific and scholarly attainment, from the pen of the most learned <sic>agricuturist</sic> in Liberia, and perhaps–West Africa, Mr. H. K. W. Johnson, late professor in Liberia College; may be satisfactory–as presenting fully all the necessary and important general information upon this particular industry together with new facts about this product which has occupied so much space in despatches heretofore sent the Department by myself and the distinguished gentlemen who preceded me in this office.</p>

<p>I may be permitted to observe that I share in the opinion of some of the most successful agriculturists of this country that, Liberia, in that better time <catchwords>hoped</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2406.jpg"/>

hoped for by the patriotic here and the friend of the Negro everywhere, is to be an agricultural country, and with such prospect before it that, all encouragement to that end from without will meet with the hearty cooperation of the most progressive class of Negro emigrants here, the farmer class, who are successfully struggling mid poverty and illiteracy by industry, and are destined to contribute more toward the glorious future that awaits Africa through this feeble beginning than any other class in the state.</p>

<p>I have watched, for three years, with very sincere interest the farming classes of this young state, and I respectfully ask for them the consideration of the capitalist &amp; <catchwords>philanthropic</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2407.jpg"/>

philanthropic classes of our country, who can make no safer and more profitable investment abroad than in aiding in the cultivation of coffee &amp; sugar here, and advancing the educational interests of the people by more extended commercial relations with Liberia.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obd't serv't,<lb/>
Jno. H. Smyth, U.S.<lb/>
Consul General</p>
