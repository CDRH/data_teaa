<dateline>United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda
Deceb.er 14, 1882</dateline>

<note>Hon: W. Hunter
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.</note>

<p>Sir
I have the honor of acknowledge the receipt of
your dispatch No. 10, in regard to agents appointed
by the until <unclear>appnored</unclear> by the Hon: Secty. of State,
it was and still is with the intention of promoting 
Am: Commerce in this part of the world, beside
putting a stop to <unclear>rimauray</unclear> seamen, for abuse
received on board Am: Whalers: and while
enforcing the N. S. Laur over this jurisdiction, to 
give pr justice to seamen, masters or officers.
"Massamedes" will in a few years become important
large fields of wheat, corn, sugar cane, and 
<unclear>cottau</unclear> are now in cultivation. </p>
<p>The Portuguese Govt. is organizing small colonies
all over that district, the Biers in "Whellah" and
"Humpata" are cutting conformity with
the Portuguese, a route from the interior; so 
that these crops and the reuslt of their bounty,
such as, Hidis Ivory ostrich features, can
be carried to Massamedes; these colonies
as well as the Baire; -and <unclear>iveu</unclear> the natives
of the interior who seem to follow now the

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0164.002"/>
    
example of the Bvers -well snow wank
farming implements; and I do not 
know if any to the compared with those
of the U. S. for simplicity, donability and 
cheapness. The merchants and large land builders will need also steam
mills, and other machinery for making 
rum, sugar, grinding corn and wheats
cleaning and pressing <unclear>cattou jnja</unclear>
Am. Wahlers seem to make their head quarters
<unclear>noer</unclear> at that place, "although the last inducements
have been granted to them by the Portuguese going."
at Loauda.</p>
<p>I understand that non Whalers men
there during last two months. Now the 
"Eliza Adams" three learn a <unclear>aivay</unclear> and
from the "Alice Knowles" a man was discharged
by reason of sickness; these seamen have
been sent to me from Messamedes at a 
great expense, and I find myself compelled
to keep them until I am able to forward
them to Sautrago Capesendes by mail steaming,
which only takes the occasionally more
as a <unclear>javor</unclear>, although I pay to the Capt.
L 5.0.0, for each man.</p>
<p>Mr. J.L. Fores that I appointed until
appored by the Hon: Sectry. of State is the
Largest merchant of Messamedes, a young

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0164.003"/>

man, full of energy, and ambitious to
promote the commerce and development
of Massamedes.</p>
<p>It is only upon close enquiry, as to his
capacity, integrity, capability <unclear>jajs</unclear> that
I appointed him. If the State Dept. has
any objections to these appointments, I 
will notify them at once as not having
been <unclear>accop</unclear> by this State Dept.</p>
<p>I have never seen either of the gentlemen 
of Anclry, Bengnella or Massamedes;
but I am confident that an agent is
needed at Massamedes for the interest
of Am: Commerce and protection of
Am: Seamen and others visiting that
port.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant</p>
