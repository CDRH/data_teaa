<p>Vice-Commercial Agency of the
United States of America.<lb/>
Sierra Leone August 1st 1868.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of a despatch 
from the Department of State dated 
June 26th, 1868 - No. 7 - informing me 
that my assumption of the charge of 
the Commercial Agency's Office at 
this settlement had been approved 
of by the Department, - that accordingly 
I had been appointed Vice 
Commercial Agent, subject to 
the conditions of law and the 
Consular regulations, and that 
the certificate of my appointment 
<catchwords>had</catchwords>

<fw>F. W. Seward Esqre<lb/>
Assistant Secretary</fw>

<pb n="107"/>

had been sent to the Legation of the 
United States at London for the 
purpose of obtaining my official recognition 
by the British Government.</p>

<p>I have also to acknowledge 
the receipt of the Forms of Consular 
Bond, oath of Office and allegiance 
and Circulars N: 68, N: 69, N: 70.</p>

<p>I beg to thank the Department 
for my appointment and will 
to the best of my abilities endeavor 
to carry out <sic>it's</sic> instructions and 
guard the interest of the United 
States Government and <sic>it's</sic> Citizens.</p>

<p>I am a native of Hamburg 
in Germany, but resident in this 
settlement since January 1847; 
my appointment emanated from 
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="108"/> 

the despatch to which I have the 
honor to reply at present.</p> 

<p>Not knowing anybody in 
the United States sufficiently to 
ask to become bond for me I have 
written to my Bankers in London 
to procure me the requisite Bondsmen, 
citizens of the United States, 
conceiving that such only the Department 
requires, on the receipt 
of the names of my Bondsmen I 
shall forward the Bond forthwith.</p>

<p>Being a naturalized British subject 
I cannot consistently take the 
oath of allegiance as prescribed in 
the printed form, having in substance 
subscribed to a similar 
oath to the British Government.</p>

<p>Not knowing whether the

<pb n="109"/>

Department keeps other forms <del>of</del>
of oaths I have taken the liberty 
to alter the form sent, consistent 
with my conscience, sworn 
to it before a Police Magistrate 
of this place, and enclose it.</p> 

<p>I have communicated 
my appointment to Sir Arthur 
E. Kennedy of the Governor-in-Chief 
of the West African 
Settlements, who provisionally
recognises it subject to <sic>it's</sic> 
approval by the British Government. </p>

<p>In conclusion I beg 
to inform the Department 
that I am Consul for the 
Netherlands and Consul 
for the Republic of Liberia 
<catchwords>for</catchwords> 

<pb n="110"/>

for both of which Offices 
I hold the Exequatur of 
Her Majesty the Queen of 
Great Britain.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
Rosenbush<lb/>
U.S. Vice-Comm: Agent.</p>
