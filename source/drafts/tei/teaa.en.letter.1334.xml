<note>Department of State Received Jan 26 1880</note>

<p>No. 43.</p>

<p>Consulate Gen'l of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, Dec. 15, 1879</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Smyth to the Ass't Sec'y of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Commerce &amp; the supervision <unclear>of</unclear> American interests.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>

<p>Importance of the commerce of Accra, Whydah, Lagos, <unclear extent="one word"/> Gaboon; absence of consular representatives at these ports.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-2242.jpg"/>

<p>No. 43.</p>

<p>Consulate Gen'l of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, Dec. 15, 1879</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to call attention to some facts with respect to the following named ports–on the West Coast of Africa with which the Department may not be familiar, viz. Accra, Whydah, Lagos, <unclear extent="one word"/> and Gaboon.</p>

<p><catchwords>We</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon. F. W. Seward,<lb/>
Ass't Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-2241.jpg"/>

We are at present without a consular representation at these ports, the last place having been made vacant by the death of Rev. Bushnell, Consul.</p>

<p>Most of our vessels that <unclear>come</unclear> to West Africa touch <unclear>on</unclear> these ports.</p>

<p>The European world <unclear>is</unclear> taking advantage of every <unclear extent="one word"/> on the coast where opportunity is given, and <unclear>having</unclear> their best efforts to <unclear>reach</unclear> and control the interior <unclear extent="one word"/>; and the U.S. with an increasing <catchwords>population</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2240.jpg"/>

population that, monthly statistics of emigration show may not be unwise with reference to future <unclear>contingency</unclear> for the Government to be advised that Africa is <unclear>at</unclear> <unclear>most</unclear> for our industries too important to be left <unclear>unregarded</unclear> or to be indifferently allowed to be occupied by others without concern on the part of the United States.</p>

<p>I have learned though not officially that the consul <catchwords>appointed</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2239.jpg"/>

appointed at Elmina (Accra Coast) <unclear>is</unclear> to be transferred to the East <unclear>Indes</unclear>.</p>

<p>Whydah is the principal port of the King of Dahomy, <unclear>a</unclear> powerful heathen monarch, <unclear>not</unclear> a man said to be deeply interested in the commerce of his county, as I have <unclear>learned</unclear> from an educated and wealthy <unclear>Dahomian</unclear> merchant–resident <unclear>of</unclear> Quitta–though largely engaged in trade at Whydah.</p>

<p>The commerce of this country is–oil, palm nuts, cam wood <unclear>and</unclear> ivory. <catchwords>Lagos</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2238.jpg"/>

Lagos is the richest port on the West Coast,–producing <unclear extent="one word"/> the British government a revenue nearly double that of Sierra Leone colony.</p>

<p>Missionary Herald, Nov., 1879. Boston–pg. 443, not 4. <unclear>Journey</unclear> Society of Arts, June 13, 1879, p. 645. <unclear>In</unclear> 1875, English produce–imported at Lagos was valued at £459,737, African <unclear>produce</unclear> exported £517,536, a total of £977,373 = $4,590,000.</p>

<p>Lagos, may be properly <unclear>called</unclear> the gateway to Abeokuta, a most important place in the <unclear><sic>Yoraba</sic></unclear> country, the land of <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2237.jpg"/>

the great Aku and Egbo or Ebo nations.</p>

<p>These people have resisted successfully the encroachments of the King of Dahomy, have a <unclear extent="one word"/> country and in thrift–<unclear extent="one or two words"/> <unclear>Aku</unclear> is the Isrealite of Africa, and is rapidly <unclear>displaying</unclear> <unclear>a</unclear> Christian civilization–through <unclear>zealous</unclear> labors of their <unclear>learned</unclear> countryman Bishop Crowther. <unclear>This</unclear> efficient coop of educated ministers and teachers have recently declared themselves a nation &amp; adopted an ensign. <catchwords>Sierra</catchwords></p>

<pb n="Roll3-2251.jpg"/>

<p>Sierra Leone was settled largely by recaptured Akus &amp; Eboes, and the sons of these Sierra Leonians who have been educated at Freetown and in England, have gone in large numbers to the land of their parents, and have thus contributed to the advancement of this portion of Africa. We are without a representative at Lagos.</p>

<p>Bonny, a country governed by a Christian King, George Pepple, whose father abolished the slave trade in his kingdom <catchwords>is</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2252.jpg"/>

is the most important oil port on the coast.</p>

<p>From personal acquaintance with His Majesty, I can with confidence–assure the Department, from various conversations had with him, while in London that, an American consular officer and American commerce in his country, would be mutually profitable.</p>

<p>I would respectfully suggest that some supervision be had over these ports in the interest of Americans.</p>

<p><catchwords>Having</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2253.jpg"/>

Having recently received a letter from Messrs. Upton and Stephens with regard to a lease of lands from the King of Danoe in the Bight of Benin, a copy of which I enclose, I was induce to write the foregoing.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obd't serv't,<lb/>
Jno. H. Smyth,<lb/>
U.S. Consul Gen'l.</p>

<p>Inclosure.</p>

<p>Copy of letter Upton &amp; Stephens to J. H. Smyth</p>

<note>True copy of letter rec'd Dec. 6, 1879.</note>

<p>Addah, Nov. 18, 1879–</p>

<p>Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Some six weeks ago we Upton &amp; Stephens leased a land in the Bight of Benin called Danoe for Trading Port for ourselves–and any other Americans or Foreigners outside of the British jurisdiction from the King &amp; His Chiefs. We wish to know if the lease will have to be registered in your office, by informing us you will of course do us a great favor, and any costs will be paid by us.</p>

<p>Hoping you are well–we remain yours.<lb/>
Upton &amp; Stephens.</p>
