Hon.W.H.Seward
Washington 

Sir

Your communication of July 
3rd, and Circular of August 28th with
the form of the Oath of Allegiance 
have been received. The duties of 
the Agency in Gaboon have not been 
onerous. In consequence of the Presidents
Proclamation of July, I think, 
relating to Citizens of the United 
States returning to the States,
I gave a certificate of citizenship
to Miss Jane A. VanAllen, who 
sailed from this port Nov. 1st in its 
Big Ocean Eagle', Phillip P. Yates Minister,
bound to New York. As <unclear></unclear> is 
a free port, + neither any duties as 
a Missionary permitting on the interest
of humanity requiring, I did not 
perform any official duties toward 
the <unclear></unclear>. 
I also am in doubt whether 
your better of July 3rd authroizing 
any such official acts.

But it is now my painful duty 
to inform you of the death of 
Capt. R.E.Lawlin of New York.
Agent for James Bishop Heo. of 
No,G. Beaver I heed New York.
Captain Lawlin was a trader of 
thirty years standing on this Coast.
He died at Camma, about 150.
Unites South of the Gaboon. His 
principla business was at that 
place. He had no responsible 
person about him. I have send 
the herd man I could find, to go 
+ take charge of the property until
I can find the means of 
bringing it to this place. I have 
written to the U.S. Sloop Saiatoga,
+ the French Commodere, Baron 
<unclear></unclear> has offered any 
assistance in his power. But I shall 
not be able to give you particular 
information before
the departure of this month's 
mail. I have not means of 
estimating the amount of property 
ledt in Comma*. It is in the 
midst of a barbarous people. 

2

21st. I have just returned from 
paying a visit to the Commiodere. He 
told me at once that he had read 
a communication the enclosed which I lead 
the rumor to address to him on the 
18th <unclear></unclear>, at his request for a written
statement of the Case of Capt. Lawlin.
The purposed at once to send a steamer 
to <unclear></unclear> the property in case 
the natives made any resistance 
to its removal. End

In regard to the Oath of Allegiance 
he said there was no one here authorized
to administer the oath, but he 
would direct the Commanddant on
shere to writing may signature to 
it this I will attend to at any earliest
convience, [The Commicdere* 
apured me that the simple request 
as an American citizen, for assistance 
to secure the property of an 
American citizen was all he required.
I have engaged an English Barque 
to go + bring the goods to this place.
I have written very full to refers
Janes Bishop H.O, + have requested 

3

them to despatch an Agent immediately 
to take charge of this business 
I shall try + keep within the law 
in my business transactions +
must beg your indulgence for 
any information in my communications.

I would simply add that after
considerable inquiry, I suppose 
the amount of African produce 
+ goods in the factory at Camma
must be between $10,000 +
$15,000 ten thousand + fifteen
thousand dollars. They associate 
in Missionary labor, Rev. J. M. 
Preston, will go to Comma in
the vessel to attend to the shippinh 
of the goods + settling up Capt.
Lawlins business there. The is a 
perfectly reliable <unclear> </unclear>. It seems
to be impossible for me to go.

I am Sir,
Your obedient Servant 
W.Walker
