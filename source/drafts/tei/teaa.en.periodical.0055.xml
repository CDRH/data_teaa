<p>African Colonization*

*An Address delivered at the Sixty-second Annual Meeting of the American Col-
onization Society, Washington, D.C., January 21, 1879, by the Rt. Rev. M.A. DeWolfe
Iiowe, D.D., Bishop of Central Pennsylvania.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>No thoughtful American can withhold the acknowledgment that
there is due to people of African descent, in this country, the best that
can be done for their welfare and happiness. Their ancestors did not,
like those of European stock, come here as colonists of their own ac-
cord to find new homes, and achieve a higher destiny. They were the
victims of a policy then common to the civilized world. France, Spain
and England drew from the shores of Africa unwilling servants to toil
for them in their colonial possessions. And so, all along our Atlantic
border, the children of Ham, were, before we became a nation, "hew-
ers of wood and drawers of water,"- menials in house and field to
other families of the human race.</p>
<p>In the progress of human events, their descendants, now numbered
by millions, are here no longer in involuntary servitude. All legal im-
pediments to their advancement are removed. They are now free to
aspire after any social or civil position to which their intelligence, edu-
cation, and moral worth may entitle them. They may amass wealth,
wield influence, hold office, like any other citizens. And individuals of
their race have achieved such distinction among us. I think there are
very few who are offended by these examples of men who have strug-
gled up from the general abasement of their people, disarmed prejudice,
and fairly secured positions of prominence and respect. Enthusiasts,
who once espoused their cause when all this was impossible, and who
have visions of the future of the race which, I apprehend, can never be
realized on this continent, say, -why not let them remain where they
are, on their native soil, and work out the problem of life, under the ad-
vantages which now are accorded to them by the amended Constitution!
Doubtless, the great mass of them will continue; and get, and hold
possession of all the titular rights which belong to American citizens.
The removal of 5,000,000 of people across the ocean is too vast an en-
terprise to be seriously considered; most of them will abide where
Providence, favoring or adverse, has fixed their lot. Yet it will be a
new chapter in human history if with all the inherent difficulties of
their position- difficulties which no change in the laws of the land can
possibly annul- they can attain to the same level of social, commercial,
and civil progression to which a dominant race of overshadowing num-
bers has long ago risen. And this perpetual inferiority will not be in
any great degree attributable to the prejudice which persists in looking
down upon a people who have once been in bondage. It is equally
true that the Indian, -civilize him as much as you will,- and the Mongo-
lain, -in whatever swarms he may come to our shores- can never com-
pete on the same arena with the race that for a thousand years has been
in the van of human progress, and has the advantage of prepossession of
education, property and power. And so, the African, impeded by his
condition and history in this country, and crowded off from the track
of progress by competitors of traditional precedence and overwhelming
numbers, will, save in a few exceptional cases, earn a precarious liveli-
hood by the sweat of his brow, hated and spurned by the laborers of
another race who dig and delve at his side.</p>
<p>The more intelligent and aspiring of African stock have a far more
inviting field of enterprise open before them on their ancestral shores.
A free Colony, which has now risen to the dignity of an independent
Republic, and which ahs been planted long enough to demonstrate that
it has in it the elements of permanency and progression, offers them an
unstinted share in its noble mission, and in its exalted destiny. There <!--there is italicized-->
is an unencumbered field in which they may seek advancement in all
that man esteems honorable without encountering invidious rivalry or
universal and indomitable prejudice. Here, at a disadvantage, because
their civilization is inferior to that which surrounds and overshadows
them, -thither they can carry a degree of moral and mental enlighten-
ment which shall entitle them at once to social respect, and incite them
to strive for the prizes of fortune and the honors of office.</p>
<p>For, most of the colonists who have already found a home in Liberia
immigrated under far less favorable circumstances than theirs who now,
and hereafter, may embark on the same great life enterprise. They
went in comparative ignorance, just released from the tutelage of servi-
tude, and invested with the terrible responsibilities of liberty in a strange
land. These have been for half a generation in the hard school of self-
dependence- introduced by philanthropists to the rudiments of book-
learning, and through freedom have regained the consciousness, and are 
fired with the ambitions of manhood. They can contribute to the com-
mon stock of society there more of the ingredients which constitute
national strength, prosperity, and honor, than their predecessors could
afford.</p>
<p>The pioneers have broken up the waste and made it ready, and have
beaten back the savages that would drive them from the strand;- now
is the time; and here are the men qualified by a special Providence to
go in with the winnowed grain of a higher civilization, to "possess the
land which the Lord sware unto their fathers."</p>
<p>The time for colonization has not passed by:- "the fulness" of it
has just come. The tokens of this fact are found both here and in Af-
rica. The experiment of political equality, now tried among us for
nearly a score of years has not shown that all distinctions of race are or
will be forgotten. Centuries cannot efface even the factitious lines
of demarkation between the races, which a century of untoward re-
lations has produced, and deeply scored. Nature forbids them to
blend; and history pronounces that they cannot stand side by side on
the same plane of elevation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Africa was never so attractive as now. The
American Colony, to which this Society has sent out more than 15,000
settlers, is more prosperous than ever. It is recognized in the family of
Nations. Its productions and exports are increasing year by year. Its
intercourse with the more intelligent tribes of the interior is constant-
ly widening and becoming more profitable. Its schools and other
institutions for the advancement of the people; its laws and admin-
istration of government, are growing more efficient and better adapted
to their needs. It has had no inconsiderable share in the suppression
of the slave trade, which is now denounced by all civilized nations,
and by the vigilance of their navies is almost banished from the seas.
Just considered as a home for the colored race, where there are none
to jostle them out of the way of progress- no impediment of law or 
prejudice, or preoccupation on the arena of manly effort, where suc-
ceeding generations may reasonably hope to surpass their fathers in all
that ennobles man and makes his life a joy to himself and a blessing
to others, Liberia is, I believe, the most inviting spot on the habita-
ble earth!</p>
<p>But, regarding the Colony on the Coast of Africa, planted, enlarged,
cultivated, and defended by colored emigrants from the United States,
as a theatre on which men of the same race can most hopefully ex-
ercise and develop the manhood that is in them, we do not half ap-
preciate its advantages, if we think of it as a mere isolated commu-
nity, bounded by the geographical limits, defined in the treaties with
the barbarous tribes that compass it about; it is the gate of entrance
to interior Africa. And, what interior Africa is we are only begin-
ning to know. The researches of Barth and Livingstone, and our own
Stanley, reveal to us that it is swarming with intelligent people, far su-
perior to the tribes which on the sea coast have been debased by in-
cessant wars, waged for the capture of prisoners to be sole to the
slave traders; that the population of the Continent is estimated at two
from the South, to the Hampton school for an education, what they
thought of going to Liberia. A dozen hands went quickly up. I in-
quired of each one the ground of his idea. A variety of reasons was
given that, I believe, fairly illustrates the status of the negro mind on
the Liberia question.</p>
<p>One yound man had, in the spirit of Christian discipleship, consecrat-
ed himself to the work of preaching the gospel in that land; several
felt that in this country the negro never will be, as they expressed it,
"free;" that the black man is and will be far from being free to
all that is open to the white man, and that only in a land of their
own can they be on even terms with all, and find the freedom which
they seek.</p>
<p>The students had heard of coffee culture in Liberia and of other in-
ducements to go; but, on the other hand, some were awaiting letters
from friends who had gone over promising to write how they got on,
but had never been heard from; some had heard of great havoc among
emigrants, and there was a general sense of insecurity and uncertainty 
as to that country.</p>
<p>One fair-skinned, bright girl had an uncle who had organized sixteen
churches in Liberia and was full of hope and enthusiasm. She meant
to go as a missionary; other young women had the same idea; the great
majority had no thought of emigration, and many had decided notions
against the Republic.</p>
<p>As a whole, the students of Hamptom expect to remain in this coun-
try, their idea being expressed by one who said "The colored man
is better off here than anywhere else in the world."</p>
<p>Our students have, more than once, been addressed by prominent
Southern men who have said to them, in effect: "Many of you are
Virginians; we must work together to build up this Commonwealth.
We believe in this work of education; you shall have your share of the
school money and we will protect you in your rights."</p>
<p>This is the tone of progressive men at the South, and their strength is
indicated by the fact that, at least in Virginia, no Democratic candi-
date dares venture, in his canvas for election to office, to denounce the
public school system.</p>
<p>The intelligent colored men and women who are honestly working for
the real welfare of their people in the Southern States, are, so far as I
know about them, winning the respect, good-will and moral support of 
the people of all classes, and in spite of many discouragements, are gen-
erally cheerful and contented. Even the average freedman does not care
to change his home. Yet, in some quarters, there are grievous com-
plaints of hard times, poor pay and bad treatment, which create
a desire for a place where living may be easier.</p>
<p>It would be strange if among the four millions of Anglo-Africans
there were not men of honest purpose and good capacity, anxious to
try a country of their own. The missionary idea is gaining strength
every year. The little company of graduates from negro schools in 
America, one of them from Hampton, who are doing excellent work at
the Mendi Mission, under the American Missionary Association, near to
Liberia, is proof that the peculiar field of the enlightened freedmen of
this country is not forgotten.</p>
<p>The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in Bos-
ton, is looking to the South for men to enter the grand field opened up
by Stanley whenever the means shall be in hand; and I do not think it
will seek in vain.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago an earnest but unsuccessful effort was made by that
Board to secure colored missionaries for Africa; yet there were many
scores of educaed negroes in the Northern States.</p>
<p>We are likely, I believe, to find in the South the finest products of
Anglo-African civilization, a better, simpler, more straight-forward de-
velopment. Thence, not exclusively of course, will go across the sea
the men who will best illustrate to the world the capabilities of their
race. White men will get a large part of the money that is to be made
from African trade, but I will have faith that colored men will do their full
share in the work of regeneration waiting to be done there, the
need of which is the most piteous "Macedonian Cry" that ever was
sent over to Christendom.</p>
<p>Africa - Liberia as one of its open doors- is the field for an Anglo-
African crusade. No other region is for a moment to be thought of
compared with this. Just as, in the Providence of God, His people are
set free, and the yound and earnest and able among them are rising to a
plane of Christian manhood and womanhood, the wonders and resources
of the Dark Continent are unfolded. Who doubts the final triumph of
right over wrong in the carrying back there of the very Christ to build
up whose Kingdom the slave-hunters were unconscious agents.</p>
<p>But there must be men and women of pure devotion and lives, of
clear, wise heads, and endowed with common sense. The requisition
for common sense will be the hardest to fill.</p>
<p>Among our colored people there is a discontented class; on edge with
things here; much occupied with its grievances, and, those of this class
who are plucky and adventurous, are disposed to try the Colored Re-
public.</p>
<p>As things are here, the finer the cultivation of a colored man, the
keener his sufferings- especially in the North, where his mental and
moral wants are so lavishly supplied, but his social cravings neglected,
and his tinted skin is a taboo<!--taboo in italics--> from congenial association. I think I
am right in stating that their advanced culture in America tends to
skepticism. The old religious nature is, to an educated negro, with-
ered by the pain that comes from finding that that which God made,
his complexion, is as a sign set against him- a mark of degradation.</p>
<p>Yet among the colored people themselves there is a prejudice of color,
here unobserved, because overpowered by that of the whites which lumps
together under its ban the purest black and the clearest white (provided
a few drops of negro blood can be traced to the latter,) and by making
common cause between them forces them into one social body. Remove
this pressure from the outside and those of pure and mixed blood become
mutually jealous; the latter assuming a superiority by reason of the
white or "Norman" blood in their veins, and the pure being proud of
their purity. This is illustrated in Jamaica where the whites, col-
ored and blacks, are completely severed socially. A trustee of Libe-
ria College told me that this question had given some trouble in the
appointments at that institution, and it appears in Liberian politics.
Going over there is not entire escape from prejudice of color.</p>
<p>There was evinced, in my conversation with the students at Hampton,
much curiosity about Liberia. They represent a class of negroes who
take a very matter-of-fact view of that country; they wish to "better
themselves," and in their pinching poverty, and in the money famine of
the South, turn eagerly to brighter prospects.</p>
<p>Wise, just treatmet of the colored laborer in the South is far from
universal. I never saw or heard of a successful Southern farmer who
did not believe in negro labor as "the best in the world;" yet one of
the leading agricultural journals says, "We are cursed with negro
labor."</p>
<p>The "darkey" is a convenient scapegoat for those who want to blame
somebody if ends don't meet. Good, kind management and wise di-
recting heads are indispensable to success with colored workmen, and
that they don't always get; the latter depend very much for the value
of their labor upon favorable outward conditions, the frequent absence
of which is to be expected in their circumstances.</p>
<p>Liberia, as giving to the enterprising but discontented or ill-treated
negro laborer scope and challenge for all his powers, is a most impor-
tant factor in reconstruction. It is simple justice, very inadequate, but
so far as it goes is a recognition of his claim to try the land he was torn 
from.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, statesmen like Clay and Webster talked of the na-
tion's debt to the negro, and this inspired the Colonization scheme,
which comanded a strong support from the South. After slapping
the abolitionists in the face with their talk of right and wrong, a later
generation freed the slave, as a war measure enfranchised him, used his
vote as political capital, and, after squandering it, have left the burden
of his education and improvement to the old slave-holders. The ac-
count has not yet been squared. It is as true to-day as it was thirty
years ago that there is debt to the race brought here by violence and
wrong, and a part of that debt is a fair chance in the land of their fathers.</p>
<p>A difficulty in the Liberian question is the negroes' self-distrust. The
race has sadly, perhaps inevitably, adopted the white man's idea of
itself. It has, as a whole, no enthusiasm, no idea or sentiment.</p>
<p>It lacks organizing power, guiding instincts. It has not genius for
throwing and keeping uppermost its best and ablest men; it has plenty
of feeling, but no flow of it, no tendency to any clear and general end
or purpose. Such tendency is developed slowly, by long experience, by
endless struggle with difficulty ending in victory, and that the citizens
of Liberia have just commenced. The ex-slave is not easily allured to a
country ruled by his own people. I have an impression that the Libe-
rians are lacking, like the race here, in esprit de corps <!--esprit de corps italics-->, in patriotic sen-
timent and in strong administration.</p>
<p>There should be accorded to the freedmen the widest opportunity to
make for themselves homes on African shores if they choose to try it.
I rejoice in the existence of the Colonization Society, believing in its
work, the founding of an African Republic. I believe in it as a begin-
ning, not as an end; a hopeful beginning; a good showing for thirty
years of effort. It is not a power; but is it not a germ of power? Gen-
erations alone can answer this. To disparage it by contrast is to re-
proach the negro for being unfortunate. It were better to blame the
Almighty directly for His doiings in permitting suffering, injustice and
misfortune to exist.</p>
<p>Give the negro a chance. You don't despise the tottering steps of a
little child: time and hard knocks only can bring strength. Let the
black man's slender self-respect stiffen by struggle, and his race pride
gain by race effort. In the United States it is a curse to be black; the
highly educated negro is like a man without a country. Help him to
make one for himself.</p>
<p>The African race has been pushed suddenly from the depths of bon-
dage to the highest liberty; it has skipped centuries in the line of devel-
opment. On its unaccustomed height it is confused; it is in its own
way; easily victimized by bad men, and troubles are inevitable.</p>
<p>Genuine progress is slow, and is the result not so much of struggle, as
of successful struggle. The thing must not only be attempted, but it
must be done, and there should be a century in which to do it.</p>
<p>When a Northern man recently asked me "Have the colored people
improved in morals in the past ten years," I asked him, "Has New Eng-
land improved in morals in the past ten years?" Every stage of civili-
zation has its peculiar difficulties and nations forge slowly ahead.</p>
<p>Progress is a moral rather than a material thing. All that is good in
civilization is "The sum of the sacrifices of those who have gone before
us."</p>
<p>The African question, at bottom, is whether there will be enough men
and women of that race who shall unselfishly and wisely devote them-
selves to its welfare. Whatever shall be fine in their future will rest on
this foundation of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Has Liberia the men, or can she get them from here? With them her
future is assured, and she will move Africa.</p>
<p>Ten such men would save her.</p>
<p>The Colonization Society claims much for its success so far. Consid-
ering that it has planted exotic ideas where men have for ages been fixed
in the lowest conditions, the Republic may be considered a wonder.
Compare it with the early stages of our own country's growth and there
is nothing to discourage.</p>
<p>We know too little about her. The roll of pamphlets sent to me to read
contains no exhaustive statement of facs, but general expresisons of
praise. I never felt really informed about Liberia till I read the letters
of Mr. Williams, correspondent of the Charleston News and Courier, <!--Charleston News and Courier in italics-->
whose mingled criticism and commendation made the Republic appear
like any new terrestrial region, full of advantages and of disadvantages.
For the first time I found what an intelligent man would say against it.
There is need of a fair, forcible account of that country, with maps and
pictures, that shall be to the colored man what a chart is to a sailor- a
guide to success and a guard against disaster.</p>
<p>How about colored communities in the United States?</p>
<p>A colony composed of the 450 manumitted slaves of John Randolph
was, in 1846, placed in Miami County, Ohio. "They suffered much at
"first from prejudice, yet soon found kind friends. While producing
"nothing remarkable, the old have died off and the new generation has
"made considerable advancement. They, however, owe more to exter-
"nal influences than to inherent qualities." This statement I gleaned
from an apparently reliable letter to the New York Tribune. <!--New York Tribune in italics--></p>
<p>There are negro communities of which I have no definite knowledge,
notably one or two in Canada; but all, I believe, were established by
an influence from without. Certainly, in America, the negroes show no
tendency in themselves to segregate.</p>
<p>They drift to the cities in throngs, where their mortality increases and
their self-respect, as a class, seems to diminish.</p>
<p>In a simple, industrious, country life, the freedmen gain in numbers
and in average prosperity and worth.</p>
<p>Against this background of life in America, stands Liberia, attempt-
ing achievements whose success its record here makes doubtful.</p>
<p>Let us wait and see the negro on his own ground, on his own resour-
ces, blundering away, but slowly learning from his blunders- as we all
do- getting experience and digesting it. Let the negro race maintain
a respectable republic, and it will furnish the best possible answer to
the charge so often made, "The negro has done nothing."
