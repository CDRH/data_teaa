<p>Memorial Concerning Conditions in the Independent State of the Kongo.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>April 19, 1904.&#8212;Presented by Mr. Morgan, referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, and ordered to be printed.</p>

<p>To the Congress of the United States of America:</p>

<p>As authorized representatives of American organizations conducting missionary and philanthropic work in the Independent State of the Kongo, in Africa, we would respectfully invite the attention of your honorable bodies to certain conditions at present existing in that State which affect vitally the well-being of the people, and concern also the rights and interests of persons from other countries desiring to reside in that State and conduct business or philanthropic enterprises. In the gravity of the case as related both to the present and future well-being of so vast a multitude of people and to our own interests and our honorable obligation as a nation, in the fact that statements are widely circulated not only making denial of the existence of these conditions, but tending to confuse the issue presented, and in the seriousness of the action we ask from you, is our excuse for dwelling at length upon the considerations which we submit for your judgment.</p>

<p>The Independent State of the Kongo A Creation of Western Powers.</p>

<p>You will recall that the Government known as the Independent State of the Kongo was unique in its origin. It came into being by act of an

<pb n="p4"/>

assembly representing all the nations of the Western World. In the original movement looking toward the creation of this Government, Leopold, the king of Belgium, bore a leading part. A company of geographers, travelers, and philanthropists, representing a number of European countries, had been called together by him in September, 1876. By this conference an organization known as the International African Association was constituted. A few years later a society was organized for a purpose described by one of its members as that of "studying what might be made of the Kongo River and its basin." This society, including at first representatives of several European countries of prominence in the commercial and monetary world, soon came almost exclusively under Belgian control. Having the same officers with the original International Association, it soon practically superseded that organization and, though in no true sense international, it renamed itself the International Association of the Kongo.</p>

<p>The United States Foremost in Favorable Action.</p>

<p>After some years spent in visits of exploration to the Kongo State, the association reported that it had entered into treaty relations with more than four hundred and fifty chiefs of the Kongo territory, and sought recognition as a quasi political power. Other plans found favor with certain European powers. A treaty was tentatively concluded between England and Portugal, involving large recognition of the rights of the latter country in Western Africa. Representatives of the International Association appealed strongly to our own Government in the interest of opposition to this treaty, and to any other form of agreement unsatisfactory to the association. As a result of this appeal, after favorable recommendation by President Arthur, the United States Government on April 22, 1884, granted recognition to the association in the following terms:</p>

<pb n="p5"/>

<q>In harmony with the traditional policy of the United States, 
which enjoins a proper regard for the commercial interests of 
their citizens, while at the same time avoiding interference 
with controversies between other powers, as well as alliances 
with other nations, the Government of the United States announces its sympathy with and approval of the humane and 
benevolent purposes of the International Association of the 
Kongo, administering, as it does, the interests of the free states there established, and will order the officers of the United States, both on land and sea, to recognize the flag of the International Association as the flag of a friendly government.</q>
 
<p>This action, taken at this critical juncture, proved determinative of the issue presented in the claims preferred by the International Association. The Government of Germany soon assumed a favorable attitude. The Anglo-Portuguese treaty 
was withdrawn. Conventions were made with the association by Great Britain and other powers. Meanwhile, a conference in which fourteen states were represented, including the American Government, was convened at Berlin, as a result of which, in January, 1885, definite sanction was given to the establishment of a free state in the basin of the Kongo, and principles regulative of its powers were adopted. Six months later, on the 1st of August, 1885, the association adopted formally the new title of the Independent State of the Kongo. Thus a new state, of which Leopold II was recognized as 
sovereign and sole administrator, was constituted. Such is the remarkable story of the way by which an individual attained to power, unlimited by internal legislative or judicial restraint, over a territory four times as great as that of France or the German Empire.</p>
 
<p>Territory, Climate, and People.</p>

<p>The Independent State of the Kongo includes a territory upwards of a million square miles in extent. Having a frontage of about 400 miles upon the Atlantic coast, it broadens vastly in the interior, comprising nearly all the basin of the Kongo River. This great river, second only to the Amazon in the 
volume of its waters, with innumerable tributary

<pb n="p6"/> 

streams, both enriches the land and affords access to all sections of the great area.</p>
 
<p>The climate in the coast district is unfavorable 
for protracted residence, but the elevated plateaus 
of the interior districts offer an attractive temperature 
and conditions in general favorable to 
health. Grazing for cattle is found on the grassy 
plains, and the timber lands, when cleared, prove 
at once reasonably fertile, producing the vegetables 
common in our markets, while the forests abound 
in tropical fruits. The most valuable product of 
the forest is supplied by the india rubber vine, the 
Independent State of the Kongo leading all other 
sections of the earth in its supply of this commercial product. It is evident that the resources 
of the country, rightly conserved and developed, 
would secure for it wealth indefinitely great and a 
corresponding position in the world's commerce.</p>
 
<p>The native peoples, of many tribes and languages, are variously estimated as numbering between 20,000,000 and 30,000,000. The earliest white visitors to the country give pleasant testimony to the traits of native character. As a rule they were welcomed and found the people ready to receive instruction. In certain sections considerable progress had been made in the development of the arts. Doctor Hinde, for example, who accompanied the expedition of Baron Dhanis for the overthrow of the Arab slave power, speaks of his surprise in finding "masons, brickmakers, agriculturalists, and ironworkers." (The Fall of the Kongo Arabs, p. 194, cited in Civilization in Kongoland, by H. R. Fox-Bourne, p. 159.) Independence, alertness of mind, curiosity, and readiness to adopt new customs are noted by travelers as characteristics of the people. In no country has missionary work found a people more hospitable or more responsive.</p>
 
<p>There was, therefore, apparently all ground for the hope that the work upon which this newly created government was entering by sanction of the nations, while encountering many difficulties,

<pb n="p7"/> 
 
would result in a constantly broadening development by which increasing blessings should come to the people, and the land should offer an attractive home to neighboring peoples and to any persons in our own country of African descent who might desire to find a home in their ancestral land.</p>
 
<p>The Profession of Disinterested Philanthropy.</p>
 
<p>This hope was encouraged by the profession made by those seeking recognition for the State. The enterprise of King Leopold found favor because it was supposed to represent two noble ideals,&#8212;a generous philanthropy and impartial freedom of commerce for all the world. The announcement made by promoters of the enterprise was definite and reiterated. The proposed State was not to exist for exploitation of the resources of the country with a view to gain to accrue to those establishing it; it was to exist for the .benefit of the native people. Indeed, at one stage the secretary of the association had written declaring that the movement had in contemplation "the establishment of a republican confederation of free negroes, the king simply reserving the right to name the president of the confederation." This thought was discredited by other promoters of the enterprise as offering too high an ideal for early realization; but the affirmation of the philanthropic character of the enterprise was incessant. Mr. Stanley, when speaking in advocacy of the movement before the London Chan1ber of Commerce, said:</p>
 
<q>The founders of the International Association have been called dreamers. Some cannot appreciate rightly, because there are no dividends attaching to it, this restless, ardent sentiment which seeks to extend civilizing influences among the dark races, and to brighten up with a glow of civilization the dark places of sad-browed Africa.</q>
 
<p>Our own Government, in taking the leadership in granting recognition to the State, emphasized the high ideals which it was thought to represent.

<pb n="p8"/> 
 
In his message to Congress in December, 1883, President Arthur dwelt upon the exalted character of these ideals. He said:</p>
 
<q>The objects of this society are philanthropic. It does not aim at permanent political control, but seeks the neutrality of the valley.</q>

<p>Our Government's recognition of the State was, in express terms, an announcement of "its sympathy with and approval of the humane and benevolent purposes" of the association.</p> 

<p>Equally explicit was the understanding determining the action of the conference at Berlin, in which our Government participated, but whose action it did not formally ratify because of the ideal controlling relations with foreign states. The preamble of the "General act of the Berlin conference" declares that the conference is "concerned as to the means of furthering the moral and material well-being of the native populations."</p> 

<p>Prince Bismarck, in an introductory address to the conference, declared that in convening it the Imperial Government of Germany was guided&#8212;</p>
 
<q>by the conviction that all the governments invited agreed in wishing to bring the natives of Africa within the pale of civilization * * * by giving its inhabitants the means of instructing themselves, by encouraging missions and enterprises calculated to spread useful knowledge, and by preparing the way for the overthrow of slavery.</q>
 
<p>At the close of the sessions of the conference Prince Bismarck paid honor to "His Majesty, King of the Belgians," as "the founder of a work * * * which should confer precious service on the cause of humanity," and added:</p>
 
<q>I pray for the prosperous development of the State, and for the fulfillment of the noble aspirations of its illustrious founder.</q>

<p>These expectations were based on the purpose avowed by the King of Belgium himself. "Our only programme, I am anxious to repeat," he said in a published letter, "is the work of moral and material regeneration." President Cleveland was

<pb n="p9"/> 
 
true to the impression widely made when, in announcing the organization of the Independent State of the Kongo, he wrote in his first annual message in December, 1885:</p>
 
<q>It is fortunate that a benighted region, owing all it has of quickening civilization to the beneficence and philanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have the advantage and security of his benevolent supervision.</q> 

<p>Freedom of Trade Guaranteed.</p>

<p>And not only is it true that the aim professedly controlling the founding of the Independent State of the Kongo was philanthropic, the understanding was definite that nothing of the nature of an individual monopoly was contemplated. The State was to be open to unrestricted commerce. This understanding appears in letters written by the promoters of the enterprise before its recognition by our Government, in the language of our state papers, in the pledges recorded in the act of the conference at Berlin, and in the explicit declaration made by the King when the name The Independent State of the Kongo was adopted. It was declared, indeed, that neither directly nor indirectly would the government of the State trade or traffic.</p>
 
<p>President Arthur, in his message of December, 1884, says:</p>
 
<q>The importance of the rich prospective trade of the Kongo Valley has led to the general conviction that it should be opened to all nations on equal terms.</q>
 
<p>Opposition to the tentative treaty by which England proposed recognition of the rights of Portugal in the Kongo Valley was based explicitly upon the fear that under Portuguese administration the commercial rights of other nations would not be safeguarded.</p>
 
<p>The general act adopted by the Berlin conference is explicit in its provision for assuring respect for the full and equal commercial rights of all nations. Its first article provides, under the heading "Declaration relative to freedom of trade in the basin of 

<pb n="p10"/> 

the Kongo, its mouths, and circumjacent regions,' that "the trade of all nations shall enjoy complete freedom."</p>
 
<p>In closing the conference Prince Bismarck said:</p> 

<q>The resolutions we are on the point of sanctioning secure to the commerce of all nations free access to the center of the African continent. The guaranties which will be provided for freedom of trade in the Kongo basin are of a nature to offer to the industries of all nations the conditions most favorable to the development of their security.</q>

<p>Such was the understanding and the purpose of those through whose action the Independent State was constituted. It was not because national governments desired to give to one man commercial privileges of vast value that they consigned the government of this newly-opened territory to his care; it was because they would retain these commercial privileges as a due possession for all peoples that this new State was given its being.</p>
 
<p>The Catalogue of Wrongs.</p>

<p>The fact to which our information concerning conditions in the Independent State of the Kongo makes it our painful duty to ask your attention is that the anticipated realization of these humane, liberal, and just ideals has not been reached by the Government of the Kongo State, but has been and is now directly thwarted by the methods of administration which the Government has adopted. Fidelity to the facts known to us compels the statement that the country to-day, throughout great sections, is suffering from a grievous oppression characterized by well-nigh incredible abuses of the people.</p>
 
<p>The story of personal sufferings is heartrending. Among the wrongs alleged in the documents accompanying our memorial are forced labor; the forced contribution of food stuffs and other supplies for the State stations and the stations of monopolist companies licensed by the State and for the 30,000 men of the regular and irregular militia; 

<pb n="p11"/> 
 
forced military service under conditions unjust alike to the soldiers and the people; direct imposts dependent upon the arbitrary will of subordinate officials or commanders of detachments of the militia, and the exaction throughout the rubber-producing districts of a heavy toll of this product; all this without respect to the consent or desire, and with slight regard to the ability, of the people. The requirements become more and more burdensome as the population diminishes and the supplies obtainable in the territories adjoining native villages are exhausted. In many instances the people are required to make contributions to the State of articles which they do not possess and which they must purchase at a cost greatly in excess of the price allowed them for supplying it. Remuneration for the contributions made is slight. The right to remuneration indeed has been denied. An exponent of the policy of the King's Government declared in the Belgian Parliament that whatever remuneration is given is a gratuity.</p>
 
<p>It is&#8212;so the testimony presented by us indicates&#8212;in connection with the enforcement of these demands made by the State upon the people that the cruelties by which the land is scourged have developed. The native is driven to his task by a remorseless physical compulsion. For evasion of the task, or for failure to perform it to the full on account of whatever inability, punishments of most shocking character are appointed. They include the seizure of women, who, chained neck to neck, are forced away from their homes and held as so-called hostages; the burning of villages; the indiscriminate slaughter of the people, pursued and hunted in the forests to which they flee; the mutilation of the living and the dead.</p>
 
<p>Horror is added to horror in the dreadful catalogue of reported wrongs. It would be difficult to name a form of atrocity belonging to any history of shameless conquest or of primitive savagery which fails to find a place in this record. The impressing of recruits for the army and for the forces
 
<pb n="p12"/>
 
of laborers is accomplished by use of the methods made familiar by the slave raids which it was thought to be the high mission of the government of this State to abolish. Slavery practically is restored throughout the State by the exaction of long terms of service for those professedly free from bondage, and in certain sections the slave market is wide open under government protection. Gruesome stories are told of the custom of leaders of scattered bands of the militia of bringing in the hands of the dead as proof that the retribution required from them has been inflicted, and of orgies of cannibals systematically permitted to prey upon the bodies of their victims as reward for their work of slaughter.</p>
 
<p>The testimony to these enormities is of such a character that, morally incredible as the stories seem, we are unable to doubt that they reproduce all too faithfully conditions prevailing through wide sections of the Independent Kongo State. This testimony, now for many years, has come to the outer world from residents of the State in a steady, unintermittent stream. The list of witnesses includes missionaries, travelers, explorers, consular residents, and agents of the State who have wearied of the work in which confessedly they had participated.</p> 

<p>The Reluctant Testimony of Missionaries.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the missionary is a reluctant witness against the government under which he lives. It is his desire, and it is for his personal interest, to cultivate the favor of the government, and the missionary devoted to his work will bear much rather than risk a total loss of power to be of service to the people. The testimony of missionaries connected with our American societies, as offered by us, includes that of Rev. G. B. Murphy (Document I), whose statement was published in the London Times, November 18, 1895; that of Rev. J. V. Sjoblom (Document II), presented to the British Government in 

<pb n="p13"/>

the year 1898, of whose testimony, as given at a meeting of the Aborigines Protection Society, Sir Charles Dilke, who was present at the meeting, has recently said:</p>
 
<q>I undertake to say that there was not a single person present who was not constrained to believe every syllable he uttered. His statement has never been shaken in any way.</q> 

<p>Another witness adds:</p>
 
<q>Apparently almost a dying man, he spoke with broken voice but intense earnestness, in simple language that left none of his hearers in doubt as to the absolute truthfulness with which he recounted his experience of five years' residence in the Equateur district.</q>
 
<p>Rev. Joseph Clark (Document III), Rev. A. Billington (Document IV), and Rev. C. L. Whitman (Document V), who are now at stations on the Upper Kongo River; and Edwin A. Layton, M.D. (Document VI), and Rev. W. M. Morrison (Document VII), who are now in this country and able, if this is desired, to supplement their testimony by personal words.</p>
 
<p>We would call particular attention to the testimony of Mr. Sjoblom, and to that of Mr. Morrison; the first, relating to a time seven years ago, is graphic and detailed, and the latter makes the reader almost a spectator of the scenes of horror as they are revealed in certain sections of the Kongo State at this very hour. Note his description of his colleague's visit to the stockade where a marauding band of cannibal savages in the service of the State had murdered helpless prisoners, and where 81 severed hands were slowly drying over a fire.</p>
 
<p>To this missionary testimony we would add also that of two missionaries of the English Baptist Mission, Rev. John H. Weeks (Document VIII) and Rev. A. E. Scrivener (Document IX). Both are living in the far interior of the State; the former tells the story of impressions made upon him on a recent return to Africa after a time of furlough, and the latter gives a detailed record of a

<pb n="p14"/>
 
journey made by him in the summer of 1903 through the Domaine Privé of the King.</p>
 
<p>Witnesses of Many Callings.</p>
 
<p>This testimony of missionaries finds impressive reinforcement in the testimony of more transient dwellers in the land: that of Mr. Ewart S. Grogan, who, in the volume From the Cape to Cairo, tells the story of a journey made by him in the year 1899 (see p. 227); that of Mr. Pickersgill, consul of the British Government, given in an official report in 1898 (see citations from this report in Civilization in Kongoland, by Mr. H. R. Fox-Bourne, pp. 177-180); that of Colonel Williams (see Affairs of West Africa, by E. D. Morel, p. 320), an officer in King Leopold's army, who in the year 1891 denounced to the King the outrages occurring under his administration; that of Major Parminter, a pioneer of the earlier days, who in 1892 sought the assistance of the Aborigines Protection Society in exposing the conduct of the Kongo Government, but who afterward was pacified by the King (see pp. 132-134, Civilization in Kongoland); that of M. Moray (see p. 252 of Civilization in Kongoland), a former agent of one of the great monopolist companies now licensed by the King; that of Senator M. Edouard Pickard, a member of the Belgian Senate, who wrote of impressions made during a visit to the Kongo in 1896 (see En Congolie, pp. 95-97, as cited in Civilization in Kongoland, pp. 244-245, 248-249).</p>
 
<p>In these testimonies the same features grow cruelly familiar&#8212;the lash, the raids of soldiers, the terror of the villagers, the weighing of baskets of rubber brought in by trembling natives, the scourging with the chicotte of hippopotamus hide, the burning of villages, indiscriminate massacre, the severed hands, the excesses of cannibalism.</p> 

<p>A Companion of Mr. Stanley.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one of these testimonies made in published volumes is more significant than that of 

<pb n="p15"/>

Mr. E. J. Glave, for a time a subordinate of Mr. Stanley in the Kongo International Association, the author of the volume Six Years in the Kongo, published in 1892, for which Mr. Stanley wrote an introduction in which he gave strong commendation of the character of the author. Mr. Glave revisited the Kongo after an absence of six years, and his record of the scenes witnessed by him as he made his way over the route followed previously with Mr. Stanley is given in articles contributed to the Century Magazine (see articles New Conditions in Central Africa, vols. 53, 54). At first he is perplexed and incredulous.</p>
 
<p>December 6 he writes:</p> 

<q>I do not think the Belgians are going the right way to work.</q> 

<p>December 7:</p> 

<q>It is said, but I must have it corroborated, that the white officer * * * has commissioned several chiefs to make raids and bring him the slaves. They are supposed to be taken out of slavery and freed, but I fail to see how this can be argued out * * *. Peaceful families have been broken up. If these conditions are to exist, I fail to see how the antislavery movement is to benefit the native. (See Century Magazine, vol. 53, p. 907·) </q>

<p>As he advances, the entries in his journal reveal the growth of his deep indignation and abhorrence. December 11 he writes: </p>

<q>The whole country is being beset by the dreadful and thoroughly unjustifiable conduct of the soldiers. (Vol. 53, p. 913.)</q>

<p>December 17 he writes again:</p>
 
<q>I do not think the natives are making much out of this partition of Africa. This antislavery movement has its dark side also. In stations in charge of white men&#8212;government soldiers&#8212;one sees strings of poor emaciated old women, some of them mere skeletons, tramping about in gangs with a rope about the neck, * * * naked, except for a miserable patch of cloth. They are prisoners of war. They form a miserable spectacle. (Vol. 53, p. 912.)</q> 

<p>January 3:</p> 

<q>This station is surrounded by villages paying tribute. It has 5,000 auxiliaries, who are sent all over the country to beat the natives into submission. (Vol. 53, p. 915.)</q>

<pb n="p16"/>

<p>February 28:</p> 

<q>We left Equateur after taking on a cargo of one hundred small slaves, principally boys seven or eight years old, with a few girls among the batch, all stolen from the natives. They talk of philanthropy and civilization. Where it is I do not know. (Vol. 54, p. 708.)</q> 

<p>March 12:</p>
 
<q>Everywhere I hear the same news of the doings of the Kongo Free State&#8212;rubber and murder, slavery in its worst form. (Vol. 54, p. 709.)</q>

<p>April 5:</p> 

<q>I saw the dead body of a carrier lying on the trail. He was nothing but skin and bone. These posts ought to give some care to porters. The heartless disregard for life is abominable. No wonder the State is hated. (Vol. 54. p. 713.)</q> 

<p>Arriving at Matadi, where his death occurred a few days later, Mr. Glave wrote, April 5:</p>

<q>If the Arabs had been the masters, this would be styled "iniquitous trafficking in human flesh and blood," but, being under the administration of the Kongo Free State, it is merely a part of their philanthropic system of liberating the natives. (Vol. 54, p. 796.)</q> 

<p>Report of British Consul&#8212;Action By British Parliament.</p>

<p>A notable confirmation and reinforcement of all this testimony is found in an official report made in February of the present year by Mr. Roger Casement, His Britannic Majesty's consul in the Independent State of the Kongo, by whom official service has been rendered to our own Government in the absence of consular representation in this State. We submit herewith his painstaking and comprehensive testimony, given after a journey through interior districts, the straightforward, regretful fidelity of which, we think, cannot fail to be apparent to every fair-minded reader. (Document X.) A single citation from the elaborate document will illustrate its character. Mr. Casement paid a visit to a large company of refugees who had sought an asylum beyond the borders of the Kongo State. He says:</p> 

<pb n="p17"/>
 
I saw and questioned several groups of these people whom I found to be industrious blacksmiths and brass workers. 1 he statements made to me by them were of such a nature that J could not believe them to be true. * * * On reaching Bolobo in September I obtained information amply confirming the statements. (For extended account of interview with these natives and the stories of massacre and mutilation given by them, see report of Mr. Casement, pp. 60 to 64.) 
In this connection we would call your attention t the fact that, even before the testilTIOny of l\fr. Cas lnent had been received, the British ParJialTICnt, after an exhaustive investigation of the te tilnony submitted to it, by unanimous vote took action looking to intervention by the signa
ory parties of the Berlin agreement. It has addrE.ssed these powers upon the subject and has placed in their hands the report of 1fr. Casement. The British premier publicly declared that the 
lroofs of the existence of grave abuses WF)re over"\ yhelming . 
.\RR. IG_ 'r 1E ¥T IN GER}"IANY AND IN THE BELGIAN 
PARLIAMENT. 
It is note"worthy also that the Gern1an Colonial Societ.y, a body 'with a men1bership of 32,000, has i sued a public appeal in a sinlilar vein, expressing its conviction of the conclusiveness of testimony as to ('onditions in this State. Even in the Belgian Jiouse of Representatives a resolution was strongly 
Llpported demanding inq1liry into adnlinistration of 1he governnient of the Kongo State on the around that the charges against it ,vere established beyond disproof or contradiction. 
The doc1lmcnts and citations presented we offer in part as direct testimony and in part as collateral reports in support of the position we would urge, namely; That there is ample ground for inquiry into conditions in the K ngo State by those to whonl right of inquiry belongs. The testimony varies in the gravity of conditions indicated, reports beconling more dark as districts more renlote from the coast are touched. Of the situation in regions far rem.oved from missionary sta
18 A 1VIe11'torial to Congress. 
tions and the path of travelers, where the native soldiers are quite without restraint in following out their ilnpulses, suggestion is given in the record of the journey of Mr. Scrivener through a section f the Domaine Prive and in a chapter of the report -of Mr. Casement. 
PROOF MADE SUPERFLUOUS BY OPEN ADOPTION OF 
AN I)l"DEFE)l"SIBLE SYSTEM. 
But vV{~ have now to remind you that, decisive as 1S the evidence of wrong suffered by the natives 'under the rule of the Independent State of the Kongo, the presentation of specific proofs of wrong is lnade almost superfluous. For the government of the Independent State of the I-(ongo undeniably has followed a course which involves apparently a central breach of faith with the pov,rers creating it and with the native people WhODl it "vas appointed to serve, and this course is such that by it the v,rrongs to which the testimony cited bears witness are invited and made inevitable. The root of administrative evils in the governm nt of the Independent State of the I-(ongo is in its lTIonopolization of the territory and the resources of the tate. 
The astonishing claitn leading to this action is now traceable in a docun1ent issued July I, 1885, which at the tim ,vas supposed to be dictated by concern for the rights of the natives. It declar d that" no one Inay dislossess any native of lands occupied by hitn," adding that" all vacant land is considered as b longing to the State.' , Later, through successive pu lic dicts, it becal11e cl ar that the term" vacant" was to be interpreted as meaning all territory in the tate with the exception of the sites of the native villag s and the gardens of such villages. rrhus ,vas con un1mat d, without offer of comp nation to th natives, this appropriation by the gOY rntnent of all the Yast Kongo territory save th little areas occupied by ,-illages and gard ns. 
Certain 1110110polist c0111panies hav heen created

in which the Kil1g has controlling financial interest, either through ownership of a majority of the stock or through demands upon the revenues; but hundreds of thousands of acres are set apart as the (( Domaine Prive " of the King. Forest and plain, hill and valley, the river and its affiuents, are his private possession. 
And the claim appli s not simply to the territory, but al1 products of this immense region, native or developed by cultivation, are claimed as the King's personal property, even the produce of the gardens. 1'he natives may not trade in these products; they may only bring them to the King's agents for such compensation as the agents choose to allow. 
AN ARMY OF SAVAGES. 
The relation of these extraordinary claims to the evils from vvhich the land is suffering is easily traced. The products of the country must he collected by the natives, and, all true motive for industry having been d.estroyed, no resort remains but that of cOlnpulsion. A body of armed men is required for enforcement of the King's will. This body 111ust be secured through raids upon the native tribes, and the more savage tribes are chosen by preference. The captives are taken far from their homes and after a time of restraint are comn1issioned for the appointed service. This " force publique" in 1896 "vas a body of 8,500 lTIen; six years later it had more than doubled in nun1bers. In addition to this native force, the monopolist companies are allo\tved to raise auxiliary forces, and savage tribes are nlade the allies of the State for prosecution of the same ends. This force as a whole is now believed to comprise a body of 30,000 men. 
The character of the work of these men is indicated in the words of 11. Edouard Pickard, a member of the Belgian Senate: "Their ferocity equals that of a pack of hounds hunting their quarry." (En Congolie, p. 201 -see citation in Civilization 
20 A llle1JlOrial to Congress. 
in Kongoland, p. 249.) Unrestrained by natural sentiments of cOInpassion, held severely responsible for securing at any cost the appointed tributes from the people, officered by nlen incited to their task by promise of ' , bounties proportionate to the results obtained," the e barbaric hordes are let loose upon the people. 1'heir representative in the villages is " the sentry," ,\'hose work is to secure the appointed levy of rubber or other products, and who is practically ,\~ithout restraint upon hi savage propensities. He is described by one visitor to the country as a " dare-devil aboriginal armed with a rifle, his pO\f\Ter limited only by such repression as the Government chooses to use." It ,vas of the e I11en 1\1r. Glave wrote: 
The black soldiers are bent on fighting and raiding: they want no peaceful settlement. They have good rifles and ammunition, realize their superiority over the natives with their bows and arrows, and they want to shoot and kill and rob * * * whether the victim be man, woman, or child. and no matter how defenseless. (Century Magazine, vol. 53. P 908.) 
It is apparent that of such a systelu wrongs and atrocities are the certain product. 
It should be borne in mind that the subordinate agents of Government, if continuing in its service, are made practically helpless. Receiving instruction to furnish a given number of soldiers and a certain amount of rubber, \f\Tith the understanding that they luuSt employ ,vhatever means are necessary, they know of no methods adequate for the end except those involving appeal to fear. Mr. Glave say that n1any -whit offic rs are averse to the india rubber r /O-ilne of the tate, but the laws comnland it. It ,,"ould be unjust not to recognize that the conditions prevailing have aroused distress in men connected with the GOyeminent, ) et it is to be fared that it is only a fe\\'" of these who have the inter sts of th people at heart, and these are po,verless to stenl the tide of oppr sion.

not reach the evil. The fault is not theirs prin1arily. I t belongs to the system and to the authority responsible for the establishlnent and enforcement of that systelTI. Proofs of individual guilt become of secondary consequence as compared with the question as to the essential character and the certain results of the system which the Government of the State has ordained. 
THE T'YO-FOLD BETR.\.Y AL OF TRUST -I. THE DEFRAUDING OF THE PEOPLE. 
From the onsiderations thus presented it is al parent that the course pursued by the Sovereign of th Independent State of the Kongo has laid his GO\ ernment open to question in respect to viola-ion of the trusts comlnitted to it. Apparently hut 'TOVemment has not been true to the faith $ len1nly plighted in behalf of the native peoples. Befor the world and before God, the Sovereign pledged hirnself in the Berlin Conference to safeguard the interests of the natives and to insure to thelTI the benefits of peace and of civilization. The few specin1ens obtainable of the treaties made by 
Ir. Stanley with native chiefs in the name of the International Association, before the Berlin Confer -nee had been convened, show that that Association pledged itself to protect the people from oppre ~ion, but, in plaee of protection and fostering car f01 their welfare, under the Government in \ rhich the rights and powers of that Association were Inerged they have suffered from every form of ill usage "which a savage inhumanity could devise, and the ruler who promised them protection has imposed upon the-m the one wholesale "wrong, the parent of all lesser acts of injustice, the cruelty of dispossessing them of their ancient rights in their native land. In these lands they held dOll1inion under tribal government, hunting in the forests and gathering the products of forest and field. Now the people practically are slaves upon their native soil. They tnay not for their own benefit e l1eet its produce; they tnay not barter

it for Inerchandise; they may only bring it to the .agents of the I ongo for such r turn as it is the
r 
pleasure of the agent to make. This is slavery in fact. I t is the imposition of bondage under the name of governlnent. 
THE T'wO-FOLD BETR. YAL OF TRuST -II. THE 
DEFRAUDL YG OF THE ~. TIO~S. 
And the crime against the natives is a crin1€ 
against the nations. The people may not trade, 
and have nothing with which to trade. So the 
trader from another land lnay not buy. The 
Berlin agreement, in it opening article, affirmed 
that the trade of all nations should enj y complete 
freedom. So solicitous was the conferenc at 
Berlin for th safeguarding of this right that, in the 
protocol of the general act of Berlin, it was pro
vided that no modifications of the agre Inent 
should be introduced tending to hamper the liberty 
of trade. No other thought could have been in the 
minds of the members of this conference than that 
of freedom in the onl"\T kind of trade possible in 
Africa, -the collecting and sale by the natives 
of their products in exchange for such European 
merchandise as th y should de ire to secure. 
To-day, with the exception of the narrow district 
of the lo"wer Kongo, where free trade, hampered 
by taxation, still exists in diminishing volume, 
the entire territori s of tbe Kongo State have been 
converted into a vast monopoly. 
Above Stan1ey Pool trade do not exist. For 
fifteen years the gr at t rritory of the Domaine 
Prive of the King ha been clo cd to all COll1
mercial enterpris . Th t rritory along the

has no"w been forced into a 1110nopoly, with the

froln the country. The purchase of products from a native by a foreign trader is nOVl a crime, exposing the trader to severe legal penalties and severer arbitrary punishn1ents. The story of the execu
ion of 1'11'. Charles Henry Stokes (see Civilization in r""ongoland, pp. 200-202, 266-270), a trader in ivory who was hanged by a representative of the Governnlent in r895, and that of the arrest and subsequent death of I-Ierr Rabinek, who originally possessed a license for trade but was refused recognition after reorganization of the I-(atanga COlnpany, are suggestive of the fortune appointed for those who presume upon the binding force of the 1 ledges given originally by the government of th "" Kongo State. 
Such is the system and policy openly adopted 
'lnd defended by the Government of the Indepen
lent State of the Kongo -apparently, the direct 
negation of the two principles made prominent in 
its original professions and determinative of the 
acti n at Berlin. 
But a presentment against the Government of 
the Independent State of the Kongo might not 
inappropriately be based also on another gro1.md, 
that of the results following from this rule. The 
levelopment confidently looked for has not re
sulted fr01TI the experiment entered upon with the 
solemn sanction of western powers. 
ACCUSING FIGURES. 
One need but consult official reports to discover 
conclusive evidence of this. Among public ex
penses we find an iten1 of 7,700,000 francs for the 
public force, the soldiery by whom the exactions of 
goven1ment are enforced, while for public works 
the expenditure is r ,000,000 francs. 
~ Tot less sugge tive are figures relating to the 
COl11merce of the country. For the year 190 I 
exportation was ' 10,035,200; of this amount 
exports of rubber and ivory represented $9,585,800. 
Thus the exportation of other products, represen
tative of such industries as develop the capabilities 
24 4. 111e11101'ial to Col1gress. 
of the people and the resources of the country, were but $449,400. It should be added that about 97 per cent of the small general trade thus reported is almost exclusively the exportation of palm products from the Lower Kongo by the Dutch house. Of the export of rubber, about SO per cent is from the private domain of the King, the remainder from territories worked by the monopolist companies. 
Equally instructive is the comparative table of exports and imports. During a period of four years we find a total exportation of $36,800,000, the imports during the same period being $17,346,000 -the importation thus representing less than one half the exportation -a situation said to be without parallel in European colonies. When to this it is added that 70 per cent of this importation represents supplies for government, stores for the railway, arms and ammunition for the lnilitary force, it will be seen how small is the inflow to the State as a whole from the products of the world's industry and invention, and how insignificant is the tidal rill from the great ocean of the world's comforts which trickles beyond the relatively favored district by the Atlantic coast. When it is recalled that ]VIr. Stanley predicted for Great Britain alone an annual trade with the Kongo of £20,000,000, the failure of the rule of its governnlent to realize the possibilities supposed to be opened before it becomes apparent. 
THE ABSENCE OF THE SCHOOL AJ.TD THE HOSPITAL. 
And we seek in vain in the Kongo State for those fornls of service 'which it is the high privilege 0 1 civilized governments to render to their peoples. ,where is the school systeln which it should have founded? ,where is the h )spital system with 
vhich it should have ministered to the ph) sical need of the people? Apparently the one movernent bearing a resemblance to philan hropic ffaTt is the plan by \\7hich orphan "Tith the ~ tate's

approyal, nlay be taken under the care ot religious or philanthropic associations; but these orphans ar the hapless little ones left parentless and home1 s by the military raids, and visitors to the counttry reproduce no more dreadful scenes than those connected with the transportation of these children fronl their village homes to those to whose care they are committed. Certain material enter.. prises, as the rail\\-ay, bear witness to great energy and perseverance, though themselves identified with terrible cost to the lives of the natives; but the e enterprises are connected directly with the one aim which unhappily seems to have absorbed 
he energies f government, that of enriching itself b T a ~wift xploitation of the natural products of th ate. 
\. BROKEN-SPIRITED PEOPLE. 
This presentment against the government of the State on the score of the results following upon its ,york is not imply of a negative character. The nllsrule of government affects directly the life of the people, in that it takes away all incentive to labor by depriving them of the rewards of toil. In the interior districts the people have no heart for the planting of gardens or for the building of (h -cllings. They live in continual alarm, fearing the coming of the soldiery. Homes are ill-kept, hou s falling into decay are not repaired. 
The picture revealed in the concurrent repres ntation of impartial witnesses is a melancholy one. Mr. Stanley, arriving at the mouth of the Kongo on the 14th of August, 1879, as the representative of the International African Association, set before himself a proud programnle : 
To ascend the river with the noble mission of sowing along its banks civilized settlements, to peacefully conquer (the country) and subdue it, to remold it in harmony with modern ideas into national states within whose limits the European merchant shall go hand in hand with the dark African trader, and justice and law and order shall prevail, and murder and lawlessness and the cruel barter of slaves shall forever cease (see The Congo, vol. I, p. 59). 
A lvfemorial to Congre:,s. 
As illustrating the unhappy contrast with this forecast presented in the conditions realized to-day, we may quote the testimony of the consul, Mr. Roger Casement, regarding one representative station in the State: 
I must confess with pain and astonishment * * * that I felt I was visiting a penal settlement. (From letter of Mr. Casement to the vice-governor-counsel of the K.ongo State, September 4, 190 3.) 
TI-IE EXHAUSTED AND DEPOPULATED LAND. 
Terrorism holds sway. The methods of the slave regime are reinforced by the inexorable authority of the Government itself. Cannibalism is carried to regions where before it was unknown. The lands are depleted. The profuse bleeding of the rubber vines has brought about their destruction in wide areas. The State is reaching on for new territories over which its devastating work may spread. The deportation of young men, the massacres and the flight of the people, are draining the population of the territory. In no one feature are the testimonies submitted by us in more painful agreement than in their description of the depopulation of the country. Every returning missionary, every traveler revisiting the land, bears testimony to this. 
Mr. Scrivener, in his record of the journey recently made through a section of the Donlaine Prive, says that one may walk for five days without seeing a single village, where once village life abounded. "The most striking characteristic of the land," so another witness writes, "is the absence of human life. It is not, after you have passed the arid mountains of Palabala, poor or unfertile; but it is empty." (M. Mille, Au Congo BeIge, p. 49.) 
M. Edouard Pickard, of the Belgian Senate, after his journey in 1896, speaks of the desolation '
j( 
resulting from the engineering exploits"; of the " mutilated forests where until lately villages had nestled"; of " great heaps of cinders amid deserted

paln1. groves and trampled-down banana fields." 
If adds: 
The terror caused by the memory of inhuman floggings and of massacres haunt their brains, and they go as fugitives to the hospitable bush or across the frontiers. (En Congolie, 
p. 95; cited p. 244, Civilization in Kongoland.) 
NIL Grogan, in his work, "From the Cape to Cairo," says: 
A country formerly well populated and apparently responsive to just treatment is now practically a howling wilderness. The scattered inhabitants live almost without cultivation in the marshes, thickets, and reeds, madly fleeing even from their own shadows. * * * The very white men who should be keeping peace where chaos now reigns supreme, spend thousands in making of peace a chaos of their own. 
( From the Cape to Carro, p. 227.) 
But the natives may not all abandon the country. 'I hel e are other perils in the outlook. It is apparent that the policy of the Government is not ,,,,inning the friendship of the people. Mr. Robert Codrington, commissioner for Great Britain in the neighboring territory of Northern Zambesia, who wrote after a tour in the Kongo district, says: 
The natives are continually in rebellion and the country is unsafe except in the immediate vicinity of the military commissaires, and within the spheres of the mis~ionaries. (Geographical Journal, May, 1902, p. 601.) 
1iutinies in the army are frequent. The Kongo State may yet work out its own doom. The forces of savagery may turn upon it. The question raised by one writer is a startling one: 
When the present rule is ended, what will remain for Europe and America to deal with? * * * a vast region with undying hatred of the whites -a great army of cannibal levies, trained in the usage of modern weapons and taught tbe worst vices of depraved men in civilized lands. 
CHOSEN METHODS INEXCUSABLE. 
It is clear that there can be no defense for this desolating and hazardous work. The dreadful story reveals no palliating feature. Had the cooperation of the people been sought in just enterprises reasonably conducted, they would have been

found willing allies. These peoples of Central Africa are not unamenable to, gentle influences. Mr. Glave 'writes of his observations in one section invaded by the raid of rubber: 
Everywhere the natives are friendly and polite. They are not lazy, good-for-nothing people. Their fine powers are obtained by hard work, sobriety, frugal living. 
And again, in almost the last words written before his death, he says: 
The methods employed by the Government are not necessary. Years ago, when I was on duty at the equator without soldiers, I never had any difficulty in getting what men I needed, nor did any other station in the old, humane days. 
He adds: 
It is only the State officials who make war. Seldom do the traders (of the older class) have any trouble, and the mission· aries never (see Century Magazine, vol. 54, p. 714). 
THE GROUND OF MISSIONARY ACTIO~. 
Our interest as missionary organizations in the record vve have been presenting is due not alone to desire for advancement for the special work in which we are engaged, though this work -in its beginnings antecedent to the founding of the Kongo State-yvas formally recognized in the action of the Berlin Conference and in the proclamations of the King as essential to realization of the philanthropic aims for which professedly the State ,"vas established. Our missionaries have sought, to quote the language of the Berlin agreetnent, 
41 
the moral and lnaterial well-being of the native population." '\That the State has failed to do they have endeavored to do. They have reduced languages to writing; they have taught the people; they are establishing schools; they are developing useful arts, and they are seeking to supplant the gross superstitions and inhulnanities of the people by Christian beliefs and practices. 1'his 'work, 'which the State had engaged to encourage and support, is adly impeded b: the conditions now developed. 
Conditions in the Kongo State. 
Our c0111plaint is not a personal one. Our missionaries personally have not been ill-used. Yet 
~1e have definite complaint as respects the security of ll1issionary work which, as furnishing a definite instance of the failure of the State to regard its treaty obligations, we have submitted to the State Department of our Governlnent. Lands, withheld in general from private purchasers, are denied to our l' presentatives. Within the past four years it has been found quite impossible to purchase land or to secure leases of land for more than a very limited period of time. Thus the guaranty of permanence essential for the development of our work is destroyed. Our Government's treaty with the Kon "'0 State definitely secured to missionary organization the right to build, and thus implicitly the ri'h to buy land upon which to build. vVhile sal of land are refused, the law forbids that a n1issionary shall remain for more than fifteen days in any place in which he does not hold a title to land; thus the stay of missionaries in the country practically is threatened. Our missionaries, moreover, at certain stations becoming increasingly numerous, are forbidden to buy supplies from the people, even the sale of food products by the natives being prohibited; they must bring these to the State agents. The missionary would gladly buy of the native at a fair price, but this privil ge is denied him. Our missionaries, thus forced to depend on the station posts for all food supplies, are made involuntary abettors of the 'wrong practiced upon the people. 
In other ways also the work our representatives 'would gladly accomplish for the uplifting of the people is thwarted. The natives, terrorized, flee fronl the approach of the unkno'w'n foreigner. The n1issionary in his touring finds villages vacated and leveled to the ground. The periodical flights of the people in certain districts render continuity of work impossible, and the total extermination of the people, accomplished no\\" in sev ral sections, obviou ly is fatal to the purpose repr sented by 
30 A Memorial to Congress. 
the missionary's presence in the land. The humane aims of missionary effort, philanthropic and Christian, are hindered and defeated through the opposing blighting influence by which the land is desolated. . 
But a larger reason influences our representatives and ourselves in this appeal-· that of regard for a people suffering from dreadful inhumanities. Those whose residence in the country gives them knowledge of these wrongs cannot remain silent without guilt. Repeated representations made to the IZongo Government by our lnissionaries having proved ineffectual, they and we are compelled by motives of common humanity and by regard for justice to bring our appeal to a higher resort. 
THE MISSIONARY A REFUGE FOR A HUNTED 
PEOPLE. 
The missionary cannot escape direct relation to this issue. I'he appeal of the people is constantly pr ssed upon him. Men, women, and children flee to the missions seeking protection. A white officer, unacquainted with the missionary whom he was addressing, after a cruel raid, jokingly remarked that he had killed many people and secured a fine lot of curios. He said that while his soldiers were firing upon the villages the people ran wildly about crying, "Sheppite, Sheppite." It was their name for Rev. W. H. Sheppard, the associate of Mr. Morrison, whom they were beseeching to come to their aid. The motive actuating our missionaries and ourselves, as we bring to you our request, is embodied in a sentence of a letter addressed by Rev. J. H. ''leeks, of the English Baptist Missionary Society, to officials in the Kongo Government: 
I deeply regret having to write this letter to you, but I cannot sit quietly and see these unfortunate folk crushed out of existence by oppression and cruelty without making a protest in the name of re1igion and of humanitv. 
Conditions in the K ongo State. 3 I 
FUTILITY OF APPEAL TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT. 
'vVe think it will be clear to you that the case 
rhich we thus bring to your attention is one demanding the intervention of those responsible for the founding of the Independent State of the Kongo. IVlay we urge that you shall not fail to note that appeal to the Government of that State would not lneet fittingly the requirernents of the case? In responsibility for the conditions now prevailing in this stricken land obviously the Government is involved, and it is scarcely appropriate to ask an alleged offender to make inquiry as to his own wrongdoing. The testimony to the existence of wrongs is testinl0ny also to indisposition in the 
Tovernlnent to remedy these wrongs. 
111e possibilities belonging to appeal to the 1(01170 Jovernnlent have already been exhausted. Dcla.r in bringing the story of these enormities [ornlally to the attention of western governments is attributable to unwillingness to believe that the facts could be known to the Administration, and to th hope that when known they would secure redress. But all reports, personal and official, private and public, if receiving any attention have won at most only the renewal of professions of innoc nee and of disinterested and humane intentions. Investigations have not been so conducted as to satisfy the conlplainants. It is alleged that witnesses have been terrorized; indeed, the native dare not testify in a court whose highest authority is the Government under which he suffers. He has no resort but a patient bearing of wrongs that he may avoid wrongs yet more dreadful. The victims of a shocking outrage when told by an anlazed visitor that they should complain to the State replied: "We should not be believed; they would put us in chains at once," and when told they should carry the bodies of their murdered dead in canoes to the official they replied, " vVe never could get past the sentries." 
It is clear that, inasmuch as it is part of the testin10ny of the witnesses in the case that com
A 1'.1e111,orial to Congress. 
plaints have been made often to the Government only to be disregarded, that the so-called investigations have been an evasion, that, indeed, the system to which the Government is definitely and persistently comlnitted is the fons et origo of the evils, these testilTIonials "will have received the attention due them only when provision is made for investigation by a pO'w'er external to the State. All replies proffered by the Government of the Independent State of the Kongo to the accusations made against it essentially are this: "The accusations are false." 1'he question of the truth or falsity of the charges is the question at issue, and inquiry impartially conducted from V\ ithout offers the one rational method for reaching a just ans\\"er to this question. 
INTERPOSITIO.-A RIGHT OF THE PO"wERS. 
The right of the nations to interpose for the suppression of these evils seems clear. It has indeed been claimed by the Government of the Kongo 
tate, as, for example, in reply to the note of the British Government, that, while the State "as created by international action, having been created, it is a sovereign power responsible only to itself for the administration of its internal affairs. If this claim were sound, it would be true that the action of the powers at Berlin, which gave tlIe I .... ing a sovereignty unlimited by internal restraint, created the one "rholl} autocratic and irresponsible governn1ent in all the civilized world. 1'he ,~alidity of this claim of one man to a gift of so fabulous value, involving so sweeping sacrifice of the primitive rights of more than a score of nlillions of people and the allied rights of all mankind, cannot be thought adtnissible. The question of gravest in en1ational concern i this: Is it true that a sovereirrn and absolute po,,-er ,vas created at Berlin, 'hich is responsible only to i .self, and that the pledg ~olenlnl~-made to other PO\\"r~. in luding Ott.. 'Yll GovcrtUl1ent are inding 
Cond'itions in the I<.ongo State. 
only in so far as in its sovereign discretion it rnay choose so to consider them? 
The Independent State of the Kongo acquired it international status by a formal acceptance of the provisions of the act of Berlin. This act is its charter, unique, and in its spirit as benignant as any known to the history of Christian civilization. 
As President Cleveland, in his n1.essage of December, 1885, recognized, "The Berlin convention laid down certain obligations, purporting to be binding on the signatories." In the binding nature of these obligations the right and duty of subsequent supervision is involved. It is a fact of the highest importance that this right and duty were recognized distinctly in the report of a committee of the conference, in which it is said: 
With regard to these native populations the conference must assume the position of an official guardian. The necessity of insuring the preservation of the natives, the duty of helping them to obtain a higher and better political and social status, the obligation to instruct them and initiate them into the advantages of civilization are unanimously recognized. 
But, in addition to these declarations of the purpose of the conference, it is also true that the Berlin agreement makes definite reservation of the right of revision of that agreement as belonging to the powers represented in the conference. Article 36 of the general act of Berlin provides: 
The signatory powers of the present general act reserve to themselves the right to introduce into it subsequently, and by common accord, such modifications and improvements as experience may show to be expedient. 
It is furthermore true that the appeal made by the Government of the Independent State of the Kongo to the conference at Brussels, in the year 1890, for authorization for the imposing of import duties, involved definite concession on the part of that State of right of supervision and revision as belonging to the parties creating it. If the State might \\ ithout impropriety violate in respec of other features the cOlnpact rna c in the B rlin act 
A fYle11Zorial to Cong1'ess. 
it n1ight without impropriety disregard its prohibition of import duties. 
THE RIGHT, A RESPONSIBILITY. 
Concession of right implicitly involves an admission of obJigation. The great treaty powers have continuing rights as supervisors and directors in the enterprise conducted by the King. The J(ing is their trustee, to execute the lower conferred by the treaty. and is answ rable to them for the use of the powers intrusted to him. Is it too much to say that the great Pow rs of the west are under ohligati n to communicate 'with the ruler of the Independent State of the 1....ongo concerning the statements relating to his rule, apparently so thoroughly supported, and to take such measures as ,yill guarantee to these unhappy people the rights established for them in th treaty of Berlin? 
RELATION OF OUR OWN GOVER. ~j\IENT TO TIllS 
RESPOl SIBILITY AND RIGHT. 
This right and responsibility belonging to other nations we tnlst will be recognized as belonging to our own American Government. We are not signatories of the act of the Berlin Conference. Does this fact deny to us the right of action at the present juncture? vVe think this position must be regarded as indefensible. 
It may, 've thinl~, justly be h ld that the sacred primal right of nlelnbership in the family of States in itself ,vould justify inquiry and protest under the la,\" of nations. 
The forelllO t part borne by us in the recognition and practical creation of the Y" ongo tate cannot be regarded as 'without bearing upon the que tion of our relation to the present situati n. 
Our presence in the conference at Berlin, and our implicit indorsement of its acti n, which fell short of a technical ratification only because of considerations of a technical natUf , further accentuates our int rest in a just di charge of its 
Cond1tio11S tn the Kongo State. 35 
pledged obligations by the Government of the Kongo State. 
The right involved in full participation in the conference at Brussels belongs to our Government. The charges made against the Independent State of the Kongo involve disloyalty to the understanding, and to the definite declarations of that conference as the) involve disloyalty to the conference at Berlin. 
Furthermore, obviously the right of a party to a treaty is ours. Our treaty of 189I secures to us definitely the right of freedom of trade, the right of all citizens to reside and build in the State. And this treaty, furthermore, formally secures to us all rights of the signatories of the Berlin agreement and the rights conceded to the most favored nation. I t is these rights which by common report are violated by the deeds and claims of the Government of the Independent State of the Kongo. 
",Te would ask your attention to certain specific provisions of the Brussels agreement and of our existing treaty with the I.(ongo State. \7\[e are convinced that, if indorsing the position that this right belongs to our Government, you will hold that in our case, also, the right involves an obligation -grave as the seriousness f the wrongs to which it relates.

From our treaty o£ r891 "we make these citations: 
ARTICLE r. There shall be full, entire, and reciprocal1iberty of commerce, establishment and navigation between the citizens and inhabitants of the two high contracting parties. 
The citizens and inhabitants of the United States of America in the Independent State of the Kongo and those of the Independent State of the Kongo in the United States of America shall have reciprocally the right, on conforming to the laws of the country, to ent.er, travel, and reside in all parts of their respective territories, to carryon business there. * * *

vVe would ask also that in vie"w of the provision of our treaty, which concedes to us all rights accorded t the most favored nation, the language of the Anglo-I7 ongo convention of r 884 b taken into consideration. 
They shall have the right of buying, of selling, of letting and of hiring lands and buildings, mines, and forests situclted within the said territories, and of founding houses of commerce. (Article II, Anglo-ICongo convention.) 
we ,yould respectfully call your attention to the fact that, be ides those forIn of procedure b5r 'hich international inquiry and interposition may

be promoted, a definite line of action is opened for our Government by Article XIII of our treaty with the Independ nt State f the Kongo. This provision reads: 
In case a difference should arise between the two high contracting parties as to the validity, interpretation, obligation, or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in the present treaty and it could not be arranged amicably by diplonlatic correspondence between the two govenlments, these last agree to submit it to the judgment of an arbitration tribunal, the decision of which they bind themselves to respect and execute loyally. 
By this provision, if in no better way, the question as to the consistency with treaty obligations of the fundamental system established in the Independent State of the Kongo may reach a definite, judicial decision. 
THE GRAVITY OF TIlE OBLIGATION. 
The obligation resting upon us as a Gr vernment seems to us a grave and solemn one. The position of our Government is such that it can act without suspicion of unworthy motive and v;.rith influence indefinitely great. And, in ependently of the demand for protection [or a h lpl s people, a qu stion is at stake which is of C01l1manding moral and political interest. 1\fay a State appropriate for its own aggran iz n1ent th land, the products, all the emoluments, of a vast national territory? I t is the issue of the close 1 door, closed against the p ople of the house and against the people of all lands. If the coming t gether of the powers were not demanded by ne 1 f r inquiry into reported abuses, it would seen1 amI ly justified by the necessity for international judgment upon the astounding claim represented by the Government of the Independent State of the Kongo. 
And the issue relates not simply to the BelgianKongo rule; it relates to the Belgian-I-Congo th ory. The evil practice of the IZongo State is infectious. Pro fs of this are not wanting in other African

territory. Shall this practice be further developed and the world's fields be appropriated for selfish aggrandizement? The menace is a serious one to the commercial interests of our Government and of all governments. The need is urgent that calm consideration and resolute action shall put upon this theory the stamp of international disapprobation and abhorrence. We believe that this is not a time when America can afford to keep silent. \Ne are convinced that our Government would scarcely be willing that such an issue should be determined without its participation in deliberation and action. 
It has been held, and with reason, that the Independent State of the Kongo should prove as a second China as a market for the absorption of lnanufactured goods. A.1ready rich areas are almost hopelessly impaired, and the depopulation of the land and the incitement of a brooding hatred in the hearts of the people threaten irrecoverable 1 ss of the vlealth rightfully belonging to the world. 
I t is on these high grounds we would bring to you our appeal: On the ground of concern for high lolitical principles; on the ground of the rights of our citizens who would be brand d as common thi ves if they w re to attempt in the Kongo State 
x rcis of their just rights in respect of trade; on the ground of righteous protest against the violation of pledges solemnly given; above all, on th ground of that humane interest in the well-being of mankind, which inft.uenced our Government in its recognition of the InteTIlational Association of the Kongo and which increasingly is characteri tic 
)£ its action in th parliament of the nations. 
OUR REQUEST. 
We therefore pray your honorable bodi s that you will take such action as seems to you most fitting for the promotion of a strict and impartial inquiry into present conditions in the Indep ndent 
tate of the Kongo through a tribunal external to the State, and that you ",·ill follow this action

with such other action as rnay be found necessary and appropriate for the correction of the evils from which that State is suffering. We are convinced that by every worthy consideration related to the ca e this course is commended. Reports of alleged wrongs certainly are sufficient in volume and definiteness to justify inquiry. The Government of the State itself should desire such investigation for the vindication of its good name if it be unjustly aspersed. The action asked by us, moreover, we are persuaded is favored by that instinctive love of just government and that compassion for helpless sufferers to which as a nation we are committed by the traditions of our past and by the generous sentiment and impulse of our people. 
Respectfully submitted, in behalf of the Conf ren c of Missionary S cieties.
