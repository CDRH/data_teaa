<note type="stamp">Department of State Received Jun 16 1891</note>

<ab>Department of State
Monrovia, May 11, 1891.</ab>

<ab>Hon: James G. Blaine<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington<lb/>
DC<lb/>
U.S.A</ab>

<ab>Sir,</ab>

<p>I have the honor by direction
to inform you that in the month 
of July 1890, the President availing
himself of a visit of the Honorable
W. McCall Davis, Attorney General 
of the Republic, to the United States, 
thought fit to commission the 
said office as a general Commissioner 
from the Republic of Liberia, to the
Government of the United States on
behalf of Liberia, with respect to 
an impending revolution of her
territorial integrity by certain of
the European Powers now engaged
in a scramble for the remaining 
portions of the African Continent 
not yet appropriated by them.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis returned to Liberia in
the month of January last, and 

<catchwords>his </catchwords>

<pb facs="20170616_150332"/>

his report to the President was to 
the effect that he had been honored 
with an interview with the Honorable 
The Secretary of State at Washington 
on the 12th November last but that 
an account of a previous engagment 
on the part of the Secretary the interview 
necessarily terminated in a few 
moments, to be renewed the next day.
That in pursuance of this arrangment 
he had repeatedly called at the Department 
of State, but that the Secretary 
times being important nature between 
the United States and the South American
Republics, it was impossible to attain 
further audience of the Secretary, within
the time allothed for this stay in the 
United States.</p>

<p>Mr Davis further reported that 
before leaving the United States, he had
addressed you from Philadelphia, a
despatched under date of 20th November 
1890, in which the object sought to be
attained by a personal interview was
fully set forth, a copy of which I have 

<catchwords>the </catchwords>

<pb facs="20170616_150338"/>

the honor to enclose, but so far 
no reply has been recieved to the <unclear>same</unclear></p>

<p>I am therefore directed to <unclear>intomate</unclear>
to you Mr. Secretary, that 
within the last few months, it has 
come to the knowledge of the 
Liberian Government, that an arrangment 
has been entered into 
between the Governments of Great
Britain and France for the delimination 
of their respective colonies
to the North and South of 
Liberia, which agreement if carried 
out in its integrity would have 
the effect to reduce the Republic 
to a mere strip along the coast 
of the Atlantic Ocean, extending 
coastwise from the Monnah River 
on the Northwest to Cape Palmas 
on the Southeast, with an average 
breadth of not more than 40 miles
from the Coast. An inspection 
of a series of Maps published by 
the Royal Geographical Society 
of Belgium, shows the proposed 
French possession on the West.

<catchwords>Coast</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170616_150344"/>

Coast of Africa immediately South
of Liberia to extend from the British 
Gold Coast to Cape Palmas, and 
fixes the furthest interior limits of 
Liberia at Boporo, assigning the 
intervening country between Boporo 
and the Niger as either French Territory,
or as liable to become a protectorate of France.</p>

<p>The Government of Liberia on 
becoming cognizant of this proposed
arrangment recently addressed a 
memorandum to the British Government, 
protecting against the conclusion 
of the said Agreement so far 
as the deprivation of its territory 
by France is concerned and soliciting the 
guard offices of said Government on its behalf. 
By command I herewith enclose a similar 
document soliciting the good offices of the 
Governments of the United States to avert
the appropriation of Liberia territory
by France, said appropriation being 
contrary to the Hinterland had recently set up
by the European Powers to regulate their 
section in making fresh organizations of 
territory on the African Continent. </p>
