Now: James G. Blaine
Secretary of State
Washington
**not made out).6
U.S.A

Sir,

I have the honor by direction
to inform you that in the month 
of July 1890, the President *crailing
himself of a visit of the Honorable
U.W.G all Paris, Attorney General 
of the Republic, to the United States, 
thought fit to commission the 
said office as a general Commissioner 
Government of the United States on
behalf of Liberia, with respect to 
an impending revolution of her
territorial integrity by certain of
the European Powers now engaged
in a scramble for the remaining 
portions of the African Continent 
not yet appropriated by them.
Mr. Davis returned to Liberia in
the month of Janurary last, and 

his 

his repost** to the President was to 
the effect that he had been honored 
with an interview with the Honorable 
The Secretary of State at Washington 
on the 12th November last but that 
an account of a previous engagment 
on the part of the Secretary the interview 
necessarily terminated in a few 
moments, to be renewed the next day.
That in pursuance of this arrangment 
he had repeatedly called at the Department 
of State, but that the Secretary 
times being important nature between 
the United States and the South American
Republics, it was impossible to attain 
further audience of the Secretary, within
the time allothed for this stay in the 
United States.

Mr Davis further reported that 
before bearing the United States, he had
addressed you from Philadelphia, a
despatched under date of 20th November 
1890, in which the object sought to be
attained by a personal interview was
fully set forth, a **cofoy of which I have 

the 

the honor to enclose, but so far 
no reply has been recieved to the *samer 

I am therefore directed to intomate**
to your Mr. Secretary, that 
within thr last few months, it has 
come to the knowledge of the 
Liberian Government, that an arrangment 
has been entered into 
between the Governments of Great
Britain and France for the delimination 
of their respective colonies
to the North and South of 
Liberia, which agreement if *canied 
out in its integrity would have 
the effect to reduce the Republic 
to a mer strip along the coast 
of the Atlantic Ocean, extending 
coastwise from the Monnah River 
on the Northwest to Cape Palmas 
on the Southeast, with an average 
*beadit of not more than 40 mile
from the Coast. An inspection 
of a series of Maps published by 
the Royal Geographical Society 
of Belgium, shows the proposed 
French possession on the West.

Coast

Coast of Africa immediately South
of Liberia to extend from the British 
Fold Coast ti Cape Palmas, and 
files the furthest interior limits of 
Liberia at Boporo, assigning thr 
intervening country between Boporo 
and the Niger as either French Territory,
am as liable to become a protectorate of France.

The Government of Liberia an 
becoming cognizant* of this proposed
arrangment recently addressed a 
memorundum to the British Government, 
protecting against the conclusion 
of the said Agreement so far 
as the deprivation of its territory 
by France is concerned and soliciting the 
guard offices of said Government on its behalf 
By command I herewith enclose a similar 
document soliciting the good offices of the 
Governments of the United States to *aveath
the appropriation of Liberia territory
by France, said appropriattion being 
contrary ti the *netherland had recently set up
by the European Powers to regulate their 
section in making fresh organizations of 
territory on the African Continent. 

I have the honor to be.
Sir
Your obident Servant 
E.D. Barday.
