<opener>Creek Town<lb/>
Old Calabar<lb/>
25 May 1864<lb/>

Sir,</opener>
<p>I duly received your letter of 12th April, desiring, on behalf of the government of the United States, a supply of Calabar bean</p>

<p>I have much pleasure in being able to comply with your request and shall send per mail a small box containing <unclear>10 lbs</unclear>. If analysis is the object there will probably be too few for any extensive  experiments. But Mr Baillie says that "500 or so would perhaps be enough". There are more than that in 10 lbs. Should more be needed I shall be happy to supply them; such if may be well that you

<pb facs="76"/>

 give me notice without any long delay, lest my supply should run out.</p>

<p>By the present mail I learn that 10 /- has been paid per pound in London but as these are for scientific purpose shall give them for 6/ per pound. </p>

<!-- right side cut off -->
<p>It is not out of place to state that about four years ago,I supplied some some of these beans to to a Dr Mitchell in Philadelphia who, I undertood was <unclear>engaged</unclear> in an analysis of African ordeals.</p>

<p>The request come to me though <unclear>one</unclear> of the missionaries at Leouises or Gabon. I may further state that the <unclear>fallest</unclear> I believe the only, account of the bean is to be found in a "Graduation thesis
published by Messrs Oliver and Boyd Edinburgh. the title is 

"The Characters, actions and therapeutic uses of the Ordeal Bean

<pb facs="77"/>

 Calabar (Physostigma Venenosum, Balfour) A graduation thesis for which a gold medal was awarded the Edinburgh University. </p>

<p>By Thomas R. Fraser M. D. Esqr &amp;c . It is published in the form of a pamphlet and gives a full account of the experiments and their results and also specimen cases of diseases in which the bean had been used as a remedy. with good results.</p>

<postscript><p>P.S. I may warn you that the bean is a deadly poison, and should be kept out of the way lest any accident happen. There is no danger unless it is eaten, of course; but I believe <unclear>two beans</unclear> may be a fatal dose. Its native name is
