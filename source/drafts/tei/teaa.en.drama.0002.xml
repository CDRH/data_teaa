<head type="sub">Prologue</head>

<stage>Time: Monday Evening.</stage>

<stage>(Mountain pass near the Capitol, Addis Ababa, an Abyssinia guard house. Soldiers singing an ode to Janhoi (King or Emporer) at raise of curtain) (First half sang with curtain down)</stage>

<p>"JANHOI"</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Soldiers of the King are we,</l>
<l>We bow to his supremecy,</l>
<l>We know naught of disloyalty,</l>
<l>Hence can not spare an enemy.</l>
<l>We do not know the world called fear,</l>
<l>We're gay and glad when danger's near,</l>
<l>From the borders of our sister"Land of Zion"</l>
<l>We're the war kings of the mighty "Land of the Lion"</l>
</lg>

<stage>(Cheers, boisterous revelry, then curtain music through [...] leading to curtain)</stage>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Janhoi, Janhoi, Janhoi,</l>
<l>For thee we take our stand</l>
<l>Oh! mighty one, thy will be done on this our native land.</l> 
<l>We beg Janhoi for prace and joy,</l>
<l>For all that justice brings</l>
<l>Forever we will loyal be,</l>
<l>To thee Oh! King of Kings.</l>
</lg>

<stage>(At finish of song, enter from Guard-house, Shambul Bolasso.)</stage> 

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Salaam Allah</p>
<stage>(Salutes soldiers)</stage>
<p>it does me good to see you in such fine spirits, my friends.</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>HASID</speaker>
<p>I beg your pardon, Shambul Bolassa, we are not in fine spirits</p> 
<stage>(Hiccoughs)</stage>
<p>the fine spirits are in us</p></sp>

<stage>(Soldiers laughs)</stage>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Very good boys, but I'm afraid this is the last spiritual [...] meeting you'll have for some time. We've got to get back [...] harnese again. There were an uprising three weeks ago in [...] division of Arusa, and I've been informed by my Uncle, [...] Negus, that we are liable to be ordered south at any time within the next few days.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERMA</speaker>
<p>Nothing would suit me better at the present time, I'm ready to start at once.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHORUS</speaker>
<p>And I And I And I.</p></sp>

</div2>

<div2 type="section">

<head type="sub">Scene 1</head>

<sp><speaker>HASID</speaker>
<stage>(With hiccough)</stage>
<p>Me too.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage>
<p>Hasid, I'm afraid if we started to-night, you wouldn't get very far, at the same time that won't prevent Semra from passing the Tej just once more to everybody</p>
<stage>(Pause)</stage>
<p>except Hasid.</p>
<stage>(Soldiers laugh and push Hasid good naturedly After cups are filled)</stage> 
<p>Is everybody supplied?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHORUS</speaker>
<p>Es-she, Es-she.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Then here's success to the "Jolly Jungle Boys"</p></sp>

<p>"Jolly Jungle Boys"</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Oh! we're the Jolly Jungle Boys and happy little chaps,</l> 
<l>O-------oh!</l>
<l>We're known in ev'ry country that is marked upon the maps</l> 
<l>Oh;-----Oh------oh!</l>
<l>We love to tease the tiger and kidd the kangaroo,</l>
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>For we're the happy, snappy chappies, savage through and through,</l> 
<l>Oh!---oh------oh!</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l>CHORUS</l>
<l>"Kiddy-come-kick-the-cocoanut-and-kick it-to-Kan-ka-kee"</l>
<l>That's the college cheer we learned at Congo-by-the-sea,</l>
<l>We led our class in cussedness and took the cake for noise,</l>
<l>For we're the handy dandy (MM-mm-mm-mm) Jungle Boys.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l>We kill the cruel Kaffirs and we hate the Hottentots,</l> 
<l>Oh---oh</l>
<l>And when the leopard sees us, he is sure to change his spots,</l> 
<l>oh---oh</l>
<l>The big gorilla loves us and we monkey with the monk</l> 
<l>Oh---oh</l>
<l>The elephant will let us put our collars in his trunk</l> 
<l>Oh---oh---oh.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Oh when the sun is setting and the sky is filled with stars,</l>
<l>Oh!--oh</l>
<l>We smoke the serpents from their holes with pipes and black cigars,</l> 
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>The lazy lizard loves to listen to our jokes and noise</l>
<l>oh!---oh</l>
<l>The big giraffe is sure to laugh to see our jungle joys</l>
<l>oh!---oh</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l>When we grow up to man's estate and fight the Zulu clan,</l> 
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>We'll murder every mothers son that's darker than a tan,</l> 
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>We'll kill their sacred cattle and we'll carry off their gals</l> 
<l>oh!---oh</l>
<l>Then if there isn't blood enough we'll fight among our pals.</l> 
<l>oh!---oh.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Our Chief is king of savages and cuts a lot of ice,</l>
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>But fears the jolly Jungle Boys and treats us mighty nice</l>
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>He always asks advice of us to carry on his wars</l>
<l>Oh!---oh</l>
<l>And we'd have whipped the English if we'd fought among the Boers.</l> 
<l>Oh!---oh.</l>
</lg>

<stage>(At finish of song, enter from L.4.E., from fly gallery, coming down mountain, Affa Negus Tegulet with servant bearing lantern Bolassa discovers Tegulet calls soldiers)</stage>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Fall in</p>
<stage>(Bus. for soldiers all form line)</stage>
<p>Your Excellency does me a great honor to call at such an unusual hour, may I inquire if your health is good?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>Is it very likely that I would be stumbling around over these hills at night if I required the attention of a sick nurse?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>No your Excellency, but I thought, ah - I thought you eh--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>Heard an annual noise I did a lot of boisterous singing, something modern in the way of European tactics, you're teaching your men, I judge?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Hardly that Uncle, but your Excellency has over looked the fact that this is your 60th birthday and we, your humble servants</p>
<stage>(Bow)</stage>
<p>were celebrating the happy event Long live his Excellency the Affa Negus Tegulet. CHORUS
Long live the Affa Negus Tegulet.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HASID</speaker>
<p>Long live Aff' Negs Teg--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>Send those young men to their quarters.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Squads, order armsat a trail, squads forward march squads right twos roght colum left!</p> 
<stage>(Exit soldiers in guard-house)</stage>
<p>Your orders have been obeyed your Excellency. Allow me once more to congratulate you. By the death of the Emporer, you look good for three score years more, that is if your present physical condition is to be taken into account.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>Your flattery doesn't alter the fact that old age removes the fire and vigor from both mind and body therefore, one does not care to be reminded with each succeeding year, that the journey of three score and ten alloted to man's career of usefullness, has been almost completed.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>But your Excellency I trust will be an exception to the rule and if, the signs are right, you have many years of usefullness left, but what of the upraising in the Arusa Division?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>The chronic complaint of too much taxes levied by the Government flavored with an argument against the law controlling the sale of live stock to foreigners, seems to have furnished an excuse foe one Yarabu, a Galla Chief, to incite his people to open rebellion, which has since been suppressed and Yarabu himself made prisoner at Harrar, but unfortunately he has escaped.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Well the chief trade of those people down there, is in horses donkeys, camels and food animals of which foreigners are the best buyers, are they not?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>Well!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Begging your pardon in advance, but isn't the law that brought about this outbreak, a little unjust?</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>It is not for you to judge whether the laws of Janhoi be just or unjust.</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Admitted my dear Uncle, but we whose proudest boast is that our institution have remained unchanged since the days of her Imperial Highness, the Queen of Sheba, are many centuries behind the civilization of the present age and strigent laws aimed at foreigners, has had much to do with our present condition.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>You went to Europe to learn the art of war, you return to teach the science of Government. The future welfare of Abyssinia demands that we place a check on the aggressive Policy of all Nations. Strigent Laws for the Government of our own people, should in no wise offend foreigners.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>I bow to your superior judgement in matter of state, but what of this fellow, Yarabu?</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>If captured he must be returned to Harrar, unless Janhoi orders otherwise</p>
<stage>(Turning to servant who is asleep)</stage>
<p>Zamish here!</p>
<stage>(Goes over and kicks Zamish who is frightened by kick)</stage>
<p>Give me the proclamation from Harrar.</p>
<stage>(Zamish gives scroll of paper to Tegulet who passes the same to Bolassa)</stage>
<p>You will find here a description of Yarabu, read it at your leisure. In the mean time, I have decided to have you meet and conduct into the Capitol, a Caravan of strangers from America. You will very likely find them at Borema Springs, take a small escort, say about four and start at noon. I shall accompany you.</p></sp>

<stage>(A shot is fired by guard. Bus.)</stage> 

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>What's the trouble, Oureeka?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>OUREEKA</speaker>
<p>A lion Shambul, a lion.</p> 
<stage>(Excitedly)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOLASSO</speaker>
<p>Semra hand me your gun quick.</p>
<stage>(Bus. for lion soldiers three or four leave guard house, cross stage and creep up path toward lion guns in hand Bolassa at cue fires lion falls over cliff soldiers run to spot where lion falls looks down make picture, backs to audience.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>TEGULET</speaker>
<p>The King of the forest has ventured on Hostile Territory and has been completely vanquished it is thus that Abyssinia should deal with aggression, whether of man or beast.</p></sp>

<stage>(CURTAIN.)</stage>

</div2>

<div2 type="section">

<head type="sub">Scene 2</head>

<stage>Time: Tuesday, 4 P.M.<lb/>
Place: Plains near Borema Springs</stage>

<stage>In the prospective Spinx, etc. a scanty bit of vegetarian. Near an oasis Caravan in motion, noise incidental to travel: "Whoa!" "get up!" "get out of the road!" etc. At rise of curtain, caravan halts.</stage>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>Whoa! Whoa! stop, I tell you! Your ears must be full of sand if you can't hear me when I tell you to stop.</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<p>What in the world's the matter now, Aunt Cally?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>I've been tellin' that fool mule for the last five minutes that something about this saddle is busted and I wanted to get down and fix it, and he paid just as much attention to me as the backsliders that sets in the front row of Mount Zion Baptist Church pays to Hezekiah Tompkins when he's preaching against wearing of fine raiments
and puttin' on airs, when the presidin' elder of the church ain't had a collection the entire summer, big enough to pay for a watermelon.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ELDER FOWLER</speaker>
<p>Madam, if you will allow me, I will assist you to Terra-firma----</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>You'll 'sist me to what?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ELDER FOWLER</speaker>
<p>To the ground, to solid earth to Terra-firma.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>Terrible Firmness is a might poor name for all this sand and rocks we've been ploughin' through for the last two weeks but don't stand there lookin' like the last rose of summer, jes 'sist me down and let me straighten out my avoirdupoise.</p></sp>

<stage>(Preacher assists Mammy to alight and fixes saddle)</stage> 

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<stage>(at the top of her voice)</stage>
<p>If anyone has no objections, and I hope they haven't, will someone kindly, I say kindly tell me why we are fritting away our time and ruining our complexions in this sislying atmosphere, when my Syce informs me we go into camp two hours hence.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>Just you tell Mr. Sizer--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>I said my Syce I mean the boy that takes care of my mule.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>Well then tell your Souse, or whatever he is, that the waist band on my mule is busted and we're waitin' for repairs</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>Well I shan't wait here any longer, I am going to catch up with those that have gone ahead, in the meantime, $$ you can do the same that is, if that poor little worn out beast can carry you fast enough. Get up!</p>
<stage>(Looks back, calls loudly: "Serena!")</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<stage>(Submissively)</stage>
<p>Yes Mam.</p></sp>

<stage>(Miss Primly exits, with Aunt Cally staring after her, hands on hips)</stage> 

<sp><speaker>ELDER FOWLER</speaker>
<stage>(Coughs to attract Mammy's attention)</stage>
<p>Madam, shall we proceed?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<stage>(Indignantly coming down stage and going back to look after vanishing eccentric lady)</stage>
<p>Did you hear--</p>
<stage>(Goes back up stage and returns, swallows before speaking with emphasis)</stage>
<p>that mutton face Hussy. Did you hear her?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ELDER FOWLER</speaker>
<p>I regret to say that I did hear the remark made by the lady whose face so muck reminds you of a sheep, and--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<stage>(With angry emphasis)</stage> 
<stage>(Exit Aunt Cally and Elder FowlerEnter several girls riding donkeys, laughing and chattering)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>DALPHNE</speaker>
<p>I say girls, I don't think we ought to stay so far behind the rest.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>NETTIE</speaker>
<p>Well the only way to make this donkey hurry, is to puta sack of oats on a stick and hold it in front of his nose.</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>LUCINDA</speaker>
<p>I haven't got any oats, but I've got a cheese sandwich in my pocket whose got a stick?</p></sp>

<stage>(Girls all talking at once and laughing exit)</stage> 

<stage>(Music Entrance of Ras and Jas Ras riding mule led by servant
followed by Jas both have rifles)</stage>

<sp><speaker>JASAMINE</speaker>
<stage>(Signals to Ras with auto fog horn Ras stops and looks back)</stage>
<p>That's your cue to dismount and perform the duties of rear guard of this Cavalcade.</p></sp>

<stage>Time: Tuesday Sunset.<lb/>
Borema Springs.</stage> 

<stage>Camp tents spread in grove of palms. Moonlight effect Servants kneeling. Rest of Caravan grouped up stage. Chorus singing "Ode to the Sun" at rise of curtain.</stage>

<stage>"ODE TO THE SUN"</stage>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Then the sun in regal splendour glids the hill tops to the West,</l> 
<l>And the Oriental day of work is done,</l>
<l>We chosen of Mohammed bow to Allah Ever Blest,</l>
<l>Whose glory is reflected by the sun.</l>

<stage>(At finish of chorus, enter from L.2.E. Miss Primly. Chorus retires up stage.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<stage>(To Serena who is kneeling)</stage>
<p>Get up from there! Is there any way in this world I'll ever be able to keep you looking respectable? Down on your knees singing with these heathens.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<stage>(Still kneeling, looks up with serious expression)</stage>
<p>I wasn't singing, I lost the buckle of my belt and I was looking---</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<stage>(interrupting, snatches Serena to her feet)</stage>
<p>Tie your belt with a rope. You don't need a buckle on your belt to be in style out here in this wilderness</p> 
<stage>(Serena starts to protest)</stage>
<p>Shut up! How dare you talk back to me! Didn't I tell you about talking back to me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<stage>(Submissively)</stage>
<p>Yes Mam.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>Don't I do everything in the world to make you happy?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<p>Yes Mam.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>Haven't I sat all day cutting down my hats, feathers, dreeses and shoes for you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<p>Yes Mam.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>And do you think if you wasn't my neice I'd do anything at all for you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<stage>(As if about to cry)</stage>
<p>Yes Mam.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>Can't you say anything but "Yes Mam"</p></sp> 

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<stage>(Wiping her eyes)</stage>
<p>Yes Mam.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<stage>(Disgusted, catches hold of Serena by arm and shakes her)</stage>
<p>Get out of my sight before I lose my temper.</p>
<stage>(Turns as if to start away)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>SERENA</speaker>
<p>Yes Mam.</p>
<stage>(Miss Primly looks amazed. Turns again and is confronted by Elder Fowler)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>ELDER FOWLER</speaker>
<p>Miss Primly, if you don't mind, would you sew a button--</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<stage>(Interrupting indignantly)</stage>
<p>No Sir!</p>
<stage>(Starts to exit in direction taken by Serena Bumps into Aunt Cally who drops cup and saucer she is carrying)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>MISS PRIMLY</speaker>
<p>Excuse me</p>
<stage>(With head high staring straight ahead exits)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<stage>(Gasping for breath)</stage>
<p>If I didn't want to lose my religion I'd say something----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ELDER FOWLER</speaker>
<stage>(Interrupting)</stage>
<p>A soft answer turneth away wrath.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>And a soft head gives advice where it ain't wanted.</p></sp>

<stage>(Elder Fowler raises hands deprecatorially, then places them together as if in silent prayer and exits)</stage>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>
<p>I don't know as I ought to said that to Elder Fowler, but he's the most aggravanist man this side of Kingdom Come.</p></sp>

<stage>(Enter Chinaman L.2.E. singing softly, carrying tea-pot passes in front of Aunt Cally who stares at Chinaman)</stage>

<sp><speaker>LUCINDA</speaker>
<p>A penny for your thoughts, Aunt Cally.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AUNT CALLY</speaker>

AUNT CALLY
(Resting in Elder Fowler's arms, looks up, closes her eyes, opens them again and sighs)
Oh! it's you.
ELDER FOWLER
(Helps Aunt Cally to her seat, who as soon as she gains her her equilibrium, rises)
I come along just in time.
AUNT CALLY
I don't know what I'd do without you, Elder Fowler, you certainly was a ministering angel at that minute.
ELDER FOWLER
I am always glad to be of service to you, Mrs Parker
(Bows profoundly, removes dress suit case Aunt Cally bows as Elder turns toward her Elder bows again)
AUNT CALLY
You know Elder, last night after I said my prayers and laid down, I was thinking---
ELDER FOWLER
(Interrupting-)
looking in Aunt Cally's eyes) Yes!
AUNT CALLY
(Whose head is turned slightly away when Elder Fowler interrupts, turns quickly toward the Elder and looks at him suspiciously)
I said last night after I said my prayers and laid down, I was thinking---- (Eyes Elder intently)
ELDER FOWLER
Yes Mrs. Parker, you said you was thinking---

Page 17 of 67


AUNT CALLY
(Decidely--)
Yes, that's what I said, I was thinking- ELDER FOWLER
(Demurely)
Thinking of what, Mrs Parker? AUNT CALLY
Thinking I was the biggest fool that ever left Kansas and if it wasn't that Ras promised me I'd see Jeruselem 'fore I got back so I'd have plenty to talk about next winter, I wouldn't come, in the first place and 'twixt you and me and the gate post, I wish I was right back where I come from-either there or down in Dixie where I was born.
ELDER FOWLER
You are from the South, then?
AUNT CALLY
(Sarcastically)
Yes from the South where all the rest of you come from 'riginally
(With hands on hips)
I'm from Ware County, Georgia, just a few miles from Way Cross, the biggest town in the County and I wish I was there to-night.
ELDER FOWLER
You are suffering from Nostalgia.
AUNT CALLY
I ain't suffering from nothin', much less the disease you're talkin' about, Elder Fowler.
ELDER FOWLER
I mean you're home sick.
AUNT CALLY
Well why didn't you say that at first? Yes I'm home-sick. I'm just naturally chuck full of memories of the South.
 Page 18 of 67


SONG
"WHERE MY FORE-FATHERS DIED" My thoughts are over yonder in old Dixie cross the sea,
I can see all of my old friends watching there to welcome me.
I can see their faces glowing as they each one clasp my hand, With that firmness that's so hard to find outside of Dixie land
I am home sick, oh so home sick and the folks at home all know, That fond mem'rys of the South land beckons me so I must go. CHORUS
I can see the old log cabin where the honey-suckles twine
I hear the mocking-birds sweet note I smell the jassamine, The picture thrills me thro' and thro' and often times I sigh, For Dixie land that good old land where my fore-fathers died.
2nd verse.
I have traveled most all over, been in almost ev'ry clime,
And most ev'ry place it seems like it stays winter all the time,
Then the flowers they don't bloom the same, the sunshine's not as bright The moon it seems dissatisfied, the stars they don't shine right
I am tired out with strangers where you look for smiles in vain,
I am longing for old Dixie, yes I want the South again.
(After song is finished exit Aunt Cally Enter Oscar calling loudly to attract attention of Elder Fowler who is apparently some distance away. Oscar stutters)
OSCAR
Elder Fowler!

OSCAR

Oh! the Bijirondi wants me. OSCAR
Ye-ye-yes the Bi-bi-bi-bi- ELDER FOWLER (Interrupting)
Never mind saying it twice, I understand.

MISS PRIMLY

(Shakes Wong, who dropspipe, jumps to his feet startled)
Wake un here, didn't I send you for this tea an hour ago? )Bus. for Wong -
Miss Primly dragging him along )

She's alright.
FRANK

Page 20 of 67


I say fellows, I don't feel altogether right about Ras and Jas they should have put in an appearance long ago. GEORGE
This isn't the first time we've went into camp without them, they'll pull up alright.
JOHN
Yes, they'll never get lost as long as Aunt Cally's voice is left to stir the breeeze, that is if they are anywhere within the ten mile limit.
JIM
(Laughing)
You'd better not let her hear that last remark, (Stops suddenly)
by jove I've an idea.
JOHN
Anything to break the monotony, what is it? JIM
We'l serenade the camp, but we'll stand over here by Aunt Cally' Cally's tent and if she comes out and puts up her usual kick about the noise we're making, we'll jolly her by telling her we were trying to remind her of the happy days of her youth when she used to listen to ye olden songs in "Twilight at Home Sweet Home"
(Song)
"TWILIGHT AT HOME SWEET HOME"
Now is the hour when from the wood, the nightingale's sweet song is heard Now is the hour when the lover fond and good is breathing love in ev'ry There is no other time either day or night,
(whispered word
When anything seems just the same as at twilight.
CHORUS
Dreaming in twilight at home sweet home,
Dreaming of wondrous things that are to come, To-night we live on Venus and the next on Saturn roam We then visit Mars and a thousand more stars
In twilight at home sweet home.

Sweet scented winds and waters clear, they whisper sweet songs in your car Now is the hour after sunset in the west when Nature lulls her family to List' to the crickets song see the glow worm's light
(rest
There's no thoughts like the ones that come just at twilight.
(Tents are made transparent in this scene, showing occupants in different attitudes, such as writing letters, reading books by spirit lamps & etc. at finish of song enter Elder Fowler and several servants)
ELDER FOWLER (To singers)
Boys I'm sorry, but you'll have to help me notify every body, that the camp will have to be moved up in the hills yonder
(Pointing off L.3.E.) The Bijirondi here (Indicating Attara)
claims that a severe storm is rapidly approaching and it would be much safer in the hills, as a number of caves up there will afford ample protection from the weather. No one has retired for the evening as yet I judge, and as it's only about twenty minutes distance, we'll walk and--
AUNT CALLY
(Interrupting pokes head out of tent white rag around head)
You mean you and the rest of them will walk, but if I've got to move this evening, you'll furnish me with the necessary means of locomotion
(Shuts flap of tent violently) (Several girls enter during confusion incidental to taking down tents.) DALPHNE
What's the matter, Elder Fowler?
NETTIE
Will I have to walk, Uncle Rube? LUCINDA
Why can't we ride, I don't see any reason---

Page 22 of 67


ELDER FOWLER
Every body is going to walk---
AUNT CALLY
(Enters from tent interrupting)
Make exceptions, Rube Fowler, make exceptions, where is my souce?
ELDER FOWLER
(Calls to servant)
Here boy, show Mrs Parker to her mule.
HASID
(Pointing off stage)
Over here.
AUNT CALLY
Elder Fowler, would you 'blige me by 'sisting me to the where-bouts of that mule?
ELDER FOWLER
Just a minute Mrs Parker,
(Calls to Wong Foo who enters L.3.)
Stay here and wait until Ras and Jas comes along. Keep one mule for their traps. We're going to camp in the caves
(Pointing off L.3.E.)
up in those hills beyond. Keep a sharp lookout for them understand---
AUNT CALLY
(Interrupting)
And if they don' show up inside of one hour, you notify me 'cause I'm coming back to look for them at the end of that time.
ELDER FOWLER This way Mrs Parker.

(Mischievously)
Hasn't the Affa Negus Tegulet a lovely disposition?
ALLAMO
He seems to forget he was once young.
ULISSA
Yes but that was long, long ago, how could you expect him to remember it.
(Enter Miram singing lively melody French perfered finish same in centre stage, then archly looks at her companions and laughs merrily)
ALLAMO
Miram is very happy to-day.
MIRAM
Why shouldn't I be happy
(Quickly)
I've been to the American Camp and sold out. ORUS GIRLS
Sold out!
MIRAM

Page 30 of 67


(Talking rapidly)
Yes and I gave them some lovely bargainstoo, every body wanted a souvenier and they got them, listen
(all gather around)
A string of beads worth four Piastres in the market here, I sold for twelve
(Girls Exclaim)
GIRLS
What!
MIRAM
Yes and a pair of bracelets worth three salts, I sold for a very fat woman who couldn't wear them, for Two Dollars and added a couple of Piastres, just to make her believe she had a bargain, wasn't I generous?
ULISSA
(With mock concern)
You'll be arrested for high-way robbery. MIRAM
Not much, I've set the price for the market to-day and you must follow suit, At least add 75 to your price, they're so generous they won't mind, and another thing girls, thay have a Ras with them and another gentleman with the title of Jas
(Confidentially)
and I've heard some awful queer things about them. VARINOE
(Sarcastically)
Do they eat little girls?
MIRAM
Not when they are as old and tough as you are. (Girls laugh-Varinoe with angry toss of head exit)
Miram continues:As I was about to say, one of the guides who understands them thoroughly, told me the following things about the American women. Those that nature has seen fit to make fat, go days at a time without food and allow themselves to be fastened in cages over tanks of hot water, in order to melt the fat, so
 Page 31 of 67


that they can become thin, and the thin ones stay in bed and eat oats, the same kind of oats horses eat, also some strange kind of nuts made of grapes. Along with this, they are ordered by their medicine man to laugh so that they may grow fat, fancy this? After they reach the age of twenty-five years, they don't have any more birth-days for three years, and then they are only twenty-six years old, and when by this process, twenty-eight years have been reached, no more birth-days are celebrat d,isn't funny?
CHORUS
(With bated breath) And the men? MIRAM
Well to give you an idea; men with an income of Ten thousand a year are always in debt and in consequence, lead miserable lives, while others raise a family of ten children on Ten Dollars a week and are happy. I must go now and get a fresh supply of goods.
(Starts to exit, discoveres Ras approaching from R.3.E) A busy day is in front of you girls,
(Points to R.3.E)
here comes the Ras
(Cue for song)
Enter Ras. Bus. for Ras spending and giving money SONG "RASTUS JOHNSON U.S.A."
I won some coin some time ago in the Louisiana Lottery,
I bought five hundred suits of clothes and went the world to see
The first place that I landed on was London o'er the way,
Where I changed my clothes so much they called me lightning Rastus J. But the thing that worried the people was my Nationality
So I wrote these lines to sing to them when they would question me. CHORUS
I'm just plain Rastus Johnson from U.S.A.
I'm traveling 'round to see the sights and throw some coin away,
I don't know my ancestry, I'se just born down in Tennessee,
Thank you, just Rastus Johnson from U.S.A.
2nd Verse.
From London I just thought I'd take a run to dear old Paris gay, To buy more wine and see more sights and throw more coin away But to tell you all the truth folks, Paris ain't no hit with me, 'Cause all you get on every hand's "Wee-wee, Monseur, wee-wee" A man once said to me says he you'se Coon African

Page 32 of 67


I fairly screamed, screamed I no sir I'll have you understand.
CHORUS
I'm just plain Rastus Johnson from U.S.A
Now I think sir that you are simply poking fun at me,
To add insult to injury, the man just grinned and said "Wee-wee" Assault and Batt'ry Rastus Johnson U.S.A.

How do you ever expect me-
(Stops short)
Never mind
(Calls boy)
You'll do
(Opens satchell, takes out pamphlets piles same in arm of boy during operation talks as follows) I never saw anything like it in my life, of course if I talked untill I dropped dead & etc.

(When enough pamphlets have been given boy)
These pamphlets will teach these poor benighted people the value of the little word "Don't", distribute them, please.
THE BOY
Yes Mam.
(Miss Primly grimaces then commences the song "Don't"
"DON'T" There's large microbes in everything so all the Doctors say,
They warn you of the fact in all the papers ev'ry day,
Now I am gald that I at least have some mind of my own,
Or else they'd have me leaving almost everything alone. CHORUS
Don't eat, that is the main thing they advise you not to do
Don't drink, not even water is the next thing they hand to you Don't kiss beware and if you're asked be sure to say "I won't" They say there's eighty-thousand microbes on each kiss so don't Advise is cheap I've always heard and I believe it's true,
Advise that folks can't use themselves they always give to you Now here's some that's no good to me which you are welcome to Some very good household advice on things you should not do. Don't keep your milk too near the ice in August it will spoil, Don't worry about moths just get a tub of fresh coal oil
And pour it on the dry goods where the moths all congregate And to this add a lighted match then go somewhere and wait.
3rd verse.
Now when it comes to Christmas time you need lots of advice
And possibly some other things and many need the price,
Don't worry with your dinner the things you're going to eat,
Eat you dinner at some friends house, they will think it quite a treat
CHORUS
Don't worry the poor children with the Christmas tales of yore, Don't tell them what you never had they've heard all that before, What is the good in grumbling on our merry Christmas day, Tho' it kills you, smile with everything you have to give away.
4th verse. "Don't"
Now here's a few exclusive don'ts concerning peoples health, They're just as good for poor folks as they are for folks of wealth Don't lose your temper quickly it will make digestion bad,

Page 34 of 67


If accidents should happen take it easy, don't get mad
CHORUS
Don't make a lot of fuss if someone steps upon your corns
Don't think mean things and wish the stepper never had been borne If someones umbrella end should stick into your eye,
Don't scream and carry on, just go and get another eye. 5th verse.
Here's some superstitions don'ts they need a little pluck,
You've simply got to follow them, they'll bring all kinds of luck If your rabbit foot don't work well don't be a bit output,
All in the world you've got to do is get a big pig foot.
CHORUS
Don't show your lucky pig foot, keep it hid that's what I mean, Don't look at it in day time what you need's a moon light scene Then find a spot and bury it and tho' this way sound strange
If you sit on that spot three months your luck is bound to change
(At finish of song, Miss Primly exits through gate Enter Elder Fowler and Aunt Cally stops long enough to deliver the following)
AUNT CALLY
Well this takes the biscuit. At home they lock up houses, they lock up stables and they lock up chicken-coops, but thisis the first time I ever saw people lock up a whole town.
ELDER FOWLER
The gates are open, so I judge there'll be no objections to our entering the City AUNT CALLY

That is it.
ULISSA

Page 35 of 67


He seems very anxious to win your love.
MIRAM
Or else, as in the story of the monkey and the lion "Die Trying" "DIE TRYING"
Once on a time a monkey man loved a little monkey maid,
And ev'ry night in her father's tree they'd spoon so people said
Things went on well 'till a Lion bad caught the monkey man one day And took him to a dark, dark cave and hid him safe away,
Then the Lion swore to the monkey maid that his love would never die And she poor foolish maid just blushed and then said with a sigh.
CHORUS
I must say that I can't see, how on earth you could come to me And mean it when you say you're love's undying.
Still if you say that you'll be true, what is a poor little monk to do But to win your love or else to die a trying.
2nd Verse.
The lion wed the monkey maid then he took her far away,
And made her work all the time and then would beat her ev'ry day She waited long 'till at last one night Mister Lion came home drunk, She left him and heart broken she went back to find her monk,
The legend says she found him, swore her love would never die,
If he would take her back, then he said with a happy sigh.
(After song "Die Tryin"' exit Miram and girls working in song Enter from L.2.E. Ras from L.3.E. Bolasso Jas appears in gate seeing Bolasso immediately exits Bolasso does not see Jas crosses stage from left to right and exits Ras goes up to gate calls:)

You'd better let these people know who I am, especially that fat soldier, I don't think he likes me. RASTUS
(Carelessly)

Oh! he's alright, to show you how he stands, he secured an invitation for our party to attend one of their annual celebrations at the Palace to-morrow night. He calls it "The Feast of the King of Kings of Abyssinia" You know this Country is full of Kings, but Menelik is the main guy. I promised the officer, we would contribute to the Emporer's Entertainment.
JASAMINE
Say Ras, I don't like this stuff they drink around here, see if you can got the King to order a little Anheuser and Bush for the entertainment, will you?
RASTUS
(Looks around suspiciously)
I want to put you wise. In this Country they hear our people calling me Ras, consequently I'm taken for a Prince of some sort, so in order to keep them from being disappointed I've confessed---
JASAMINE
(Interrupting)
Taht you're just plain Rastus Johnson from Kansas.
RASTUS
Nothing of the sort, I told them I was travelling incoginto. My Kingdom was--- JASAMINE
(Interrupting)
Wilson County, Kansas.
RASTUS
Oh! no that's too commonplace.
JASAMINE
Did you find out whether a Jas cuts any figure?
RASTUS
A De Jas over here, is a general in the army. I told them you left off the De part of your title, because in our Country, great fighters were very modest and always trveled incog., so all you've got to do is poke out your chest and every body will be afraid of you.
JASAMINE

(Aside)
Everybody except that fat soldier.
RASTUS
Act like a man of importance, spend your money as if you found it in the street if you want to be popular and above everything, holdyour nerve-
(Bolasso enters Ras is noticed by Jas) JASAMINE
(Hurridedly)
I'll be back in a minute.
(Exit L. Bolasso exits centre Ras gazes after Jas who exits quickly Ras turns as if to cross stage when Miram enters from R. Miram makes courtesy Ras bows same is repeated several times)
RASTUS
Do you think you could learn to - (Quickly)
of course you couldn't it's too sudden (Slower)
but I thought you-uh, you-uh and then again I might have known You see, this morning when you as down to our Camp, I didn't, I didn't, well for that matter neither did you, of course it's really too much to expect a person -
(Makes several effort to continue fans violently with hat) Isn't it warm?
MIRAM
I thought the weather decidedly pleasant to-day, sir. RASTUS
Of course it is, how kind of you to say so. You see where I come from. MIRAM
(Interrupting)

Page 38 of 67


I'm sure the place you came from must be beautiful RASTUS
Yes Kansas
(Confusedly)
I mean Kansas City. No, no I mean, well, you never saw anything like it in your life. MIRAM
Kansas?
RASTUS
(Disgusted) No no. MIRAM (Inquiringly) Kansas City? RASTUS (Aside)
It's a shame to spring this on her.
(With important air)
you see where I came from, I'm the King Bee of the village.
MIRAM
(Vaguely)
Then you're a Village King. Tell me about your beautiful home, I'm so anxious to know all about it. RASTUS
(Aside)
It's a shame to take the money, I wonder if she can stand it

Close your eyes and let the fairy wings of fancy carry you through an undulating region, intersected by valleys, where all the beauties of Nature are collected to delight the eye of man. Silver rivulets that glitter for a moment and with rapid flight, disappear as if swallowed up by the verdant banks that mark their course, leaving in their wake, the fragrance ofwild flowers, whose perfumes kisses the breast of bright plumaged birds as they wing their way at dawn, o'er fields of golden grain. Where the rays of the setting sun peeping through the dense foliage of an ivy covered retreat, tint in glowing colors, the expectant faces of its occupants Maidens singing an Ode to Their King on the Isle of Content.

2nd verse RASTUS (sings)
Now I rule everything in sight as far as I can see,
Why even the very air that's breathed is also ruled by me,

He looks like three small dimes to me, I've got sis-teen to his one.

Now you talk about the Sultan of Turkey, he looks like a cold storage fowl to me,
I'll go further in saying that the King of Spain is a large thick frost with me.

Put your `cyclopedia and your his'trys in a bunch, take a long day off and bring your lunch, When you try to find a King like me.

BOLASSO
Is my report to Janhoi, of the capture of Yarabu, satisfactory to your Excellency? TEGULET
 Page 44 of 67


With one exception your report is accurate. BOLASSO
What have I failed to mention?
TEGULET
The part your men took in the affair. BOLASSO
Hannibal the Oarthaginian general, slew between Forty and Fifty Thousand men at Cannae. Frederick the Great of Leuthen defeated Eighty Thousand Austrians. Napoleon whipped the combined armies of Austria and Russia at Austerlitz. Wellington won the battle of Waterloo and with your permission, my Dear Uncle, as my report will show, Shambul Bolassa captured Yarabu.
TEGULET
And if I was not your Uncle?
(Enter Zamish from door R.)
Well Zamish -
ZAMISH
(Salutes)
The market girl Miram desires to speak with Shambul Bolassa.
(Looking suspiciously at Bolassa)
TEGULET
Admit her.
(Tegulet goes to table and arranges articles on table) (Enters hurridly Miram who salutes Bolassa and Tegulet followed by Miss Primly)
MIRAM
I beg your pardon, Shambul Bolassa for disturbing, but - (hesitating)
I-
BOLASSO

Page 45 of 67


Speak out, what can I do for your?
MIRAM
(Salutes Bolassa)
In the market yesterday, Ras Johnson and Jas Jenkins, two members of the American Caravan, were taken by your soldiers -
MISS PRIMLY
(Interrupting)
Yes and I think it was an outrage.
(Tegulet looks severely at Miss Primly Bolassa surprised Miss Primly subsides)
MIRAM
And after much persuation by the women folks--
MISS PRIMLY
Yes I was one of them, I--
(Tegulet and Bolassa show impatience by staring at Miss Primly who stops talking)
MIRAM
I ventured to come here to ask you, if you wouldn't be lenient as possible and use your influence with his Excellency, the Affa Negus Tegulet
(Salute quickly)
to have them returnedoto their friends.
BOLASSO
I'm afraid you're mistaken as totthe identity of one of them.
MISS PRIMLY
No she isn't either, she knows exactly what she's talking about in the first place-- TEGULET
(Interrupting angrily)
Hold your tongue.

Page 46 of 67


(Miss Primly makes motion as if to catch hold of tongue) MIRAM
I'm quite sure both of them came with the American Caravan and besides, Ras Johnson told me to remind you, that you yourself had secured an invitation for him and his party to the Palace to-night and unless you released him, he would not be able to attend.
TEGULET
See to this at once and report to me here, the result of your investigation.
(Exit Tegulet centre Bolassa watches exit)
BOLASSO
Depend on me to sift the matter thoroughly-
MISS PRIMLY
Well I'm glad he's gone.
(Bolassa turns to Miram)
MIRAM
You'll do what you can for them, won't you Shambul Bolasara?
BOLASSO
Anything to be obliging run along, I'll follow you.
MISS PRIMLY
Would you mind if we walked?
(Exit Miram and Miss Primly with head in air)
BOLASSO

Just my luck, and I sat up all night to make out that report.

SOLDIERS

KING MENELIK, II
You may speak Tegulet, but be brief. I would not mar the pleasure of the day with too much business (Menelik sits after speech)
TEGULET
Brevity in this case, your Majesty, is an absolute necessity. The report looking to the re-organization of our financial system is unfinished. The present medium of exchange has been in vogue many centuries and is very difficult of re-adjustment Therefore, we your humble servants, beg your indulgence for an extension of time.
KING MENELIK, II
Granted Anything else?
(Tegulet picks up large bundle of manuscripts)
TEGULET
A petition, your Majesty-

No petitions.

At the last meeting of the council, the merchant Ali Obi was proven guilty of stealing from his customers by giving short measure.-
KING MENELIK, II
Yes, I remember he came before me for sentence to-day, any thing else? TEGULET
One more item, your Majesty, two members of the American Caravan were arrested in the market place yesterday, in the case of one, there is possibly a mistake, if so I have sent Bolassa to clear up the matter, the other is charged with stealing a vase. Ali Obi and Jasmine Jenkins, the prisoners await your Majesty's pleasure.
KING MENELIK, II Bring them before me
(Enter prisoners chained together, followed by soldier Prisoners are placed between doors, soldier station himself at door on R. Enter Semra hurridly gives gun to guard at door, walks to center facing Menelik, kneels and salutes Menelik then rises)

With your permission, your Majesty -
KING MENELIK, II
Speak, Semra.
SERMA
Shambul Bolassa reports he has just taken Yarabu.
(Menelik rises with subdued excitement. Semra salutes, walks backward to door takes gun Exits) KING MENELIK, II
Members of the council: I shall make an example of this rebellious chief. Time after time, concession after concession has been made to these unruly people of the Arusa Division. Leniency in similar cases in the past, has been mistaken as fear on my part. I shall dispel the allusion and at the same time, satisfy an overweening ambition that doubts the wisdom of a descendant of the Queen of Sheba to legislate with justice for all the people of Ethiopia. I shall send Yarabu with an escort of a thousand soldiers, back to the Arusa Division, but I shall send him back piece at a time and when all the parts shall have arrived in the public market place of his native village, I wish my own hand, shall feed his body to the Hyenas, as a warning to any and all who shall attempt to defy the mandates of Menelik, the second King of Kings of Ethiopia.
(Enter Ras Followed by Bolassa Ras goes to center Bolassa stops long enough to salute Menelik, then advances to Ras's side Ras in same costume worn when arrested Menelik angrily inquires who is this person
 Page 49 of 67


that does not know how to appear before a king? RASTUS
You see Mr. Menelik, on account of the peculiar circumstances surrounding my case, I had not choice in the matter of dress and I --
KING MENELIK, II
(Interrupting)
Silence! Bolassa, who is this person?
BOLASSO
Ras Johnson your majesty, leader of the American Caravan.
RASTUS
I was arrested yesterday in the market place--
BOLASSO
(Interrupting)
A mistake your Majesty, made by four of my men who believed, on account of his strange dress, tallying somewhat with the description sent from Harrar, that he was Yarabu
KING MENELIK, II
You owe an apology to this young man, but for the present, business of more importance requires your immediate attention. Go back to the prison and return to my presence with Yarabu
BOLASSO
I regret to inform your Majesty, that Yarabu while resisting capture, was severely wounded and died a few minutes after, I sent Semra with report of his arrest.
KING MENELIK, II
(Meditatively)
Fate was kind to Yarabu, I intended-but no matter
(Impatiently)
The prisoner Ali Obi
(Ali Obi is led before Menelik by soldiers at R door) (To Ali Obi)

Page 50 of 67


Your offense calls for no comment on my part. This is the second time that you have been convicted of dishonest dealing with your customers The first time you were fine, but in your case fines are not affective. - In the market-place at noon to-morrow, your right hand will be severed at the wrist All thieves must pay the same penalty.
(With nod of head to soldiers)
Take him away!
(Turns to Tegulet as if in conversation, while soldier removes prisoner)
Now Tegulet, the foreigners.
TEGULET
Accused by the market girls of taking a vase Eighty Piastres, and not paying for the same, RASTUS
I haven't gotten any money with me, but if you gentlemen will give me twenty minutes, I'll bring you a cart load of Piatstres. I know somebody has made a mistake, so if you will call all bets off, I'll make good for my friend Jas.
KING MENELIK, II
That young man will not be allowed to remain in this chamber if he speaks again without my permission (To Jas)
Of course you can explain why you failed to pay for the vase?
JASAMINE
I didn't have the chance, I had just put my hands on the-
(hesitating)
KING MENELIK, II
(supplying the word)
Vase.
JASAMINE
Yes, when the soldiers come along with Ras and I jist forgot I had the, the the thing in my hand. I never intended to steal it. Why since I've been old enough to understand right from wrong, My ole Mammy always taught me to keep my hands off other peoples property but I suppose when I was a little fellow I didn't always take Mammy's advice. Now and then I used to go into Farmer Dale's watermellon patch and examine the
 Page 51 of 67


mellons to see if they were ripe, and sometimes when I've caught him dozing on his front porch, I've sneaked back into the orchard and took a few peaches or apples but I reckon that didn't make me any worse than the rest of the boys, for there wasn't one in the neighborhood would have a missed a chance like that, and since I've growed up, I've lived so I could look any man or for that matter, woman in the face, and say, I never took the price of even an apple from anybody and now I'll leave off where I begun. I didn't know I had the thing in my hand. I never intended to steal it and I know you wouldn't have my hands cut off.
(Pleadingly look at hands)
These hands I've got to work with to make a living, because a woman has made a mistake and accused me of being a thief.
KING MENELIK, II (Rises)
I shall send for the market girl. If after hearing her story, I decide to release you on payment of the cost of the vase, four strokes on the gong in yonder lobby will be sounded. If on the contrary, you hear but three, your fate will be the same as that of the thief Ali Obi.
(When door is opened O. anthem is played off stage Menelik followed by Tegulet, Priests and soldiers exit, leaving Bolassa, Ras, Jas and guards)
BOLASSO
(To Ras)
Come we will wait for the decision here.
(Pointing off stage through door at right exit Bolassa)
RASTUS
(Grasping Jas's hand sympathetically)
If the decision is against you I'll use every dollar I have to make them change their mind
(Ras holds Jas' hand for a moment then exits hurridly without looking back Jas unconsciously starts to follow Ras soldiers close door between them Jas looks pleadingly at soldiers soldiers stare straight ahead Jas scratches head dubiously, looks resignedly at soldiers, then audience.

TimeTuesday 4 P.M. Place Plains near Borema Springs. RASTUS
I thought as much Here I am devoting every minute of my valuable time, improving your physical condition and Pedistrianism is the best means to that end, and this is the way you appreciate it and I suppose you'll round off your ingratitude by asking me to dismount so that you can ride?
JASAMINE
Words fail to explain how much I appreciate your devotion to my physical condition. You've proved that to my entire satisfaction when ever there was a chance for both of us to ride, you've always let me walk and another thing, there never was a selfish bone in my body.
RASTUS
Then why do you wish me to dismount?
 Page 56 of 67


JASAMINE
Sympathy for the mule.
(Ras dismounts)
RASTUS
You're right, you're right
(Ras goes over and shakes Jas's hand)
You've a great big heart in that rusty body of yours. I never thought there was such a thing as sympathy in your make up. I was just going to dismount and let you ride.
JASAMINE
Well if that's the case, I ---

To kiss the mule good-bye. RASTUS
(Takes roll of money from pocket)
Here's a couple of thousand, buy yourself an automobile, forget the mule and be happy, take the world as it comes and like me, look at things with the eye of a Philosopher.
JASAMINE
And you's a Philosopy?
RASTUS
Philosopher.
JASAMINE
What's the duty of a Philosophiloso-
( finally add pede)
RASTUS
Philosopher.
JASAMINE
Well what's his duty?
RASTUS
To look on the bright side of other people's troubles when you haven't any of your own. JASAMINE
( Chaking Ras's hand violently)
You're right, you're right.
RASTUS
Now we understand each other, I'll let you into a little secret.

Page 58 of 67


JASAMINE
Before you tell me that secret, give me one of the crackers you've got in your pocket? RASTUS
You must learn to withstand temptation. Over feeding is not conducive to good physical condition, allow me to quote Shakesphere on the subject "Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits" and I want you to have your wits about you at all times.
JASAMINE
The day that Shakesphere said that, I bet he hadn't walked 14 miles with nothing but a ham sandwich under his belt.
RASTUS
(Takes out roll of money)
Here's Ten Dollars, we'll reach the Capitol to-morrow, when you get in town buy yourself a good chicken dinner. Forget your troubles of the day before and be happy.
JASAMINE
Shakesphere, Ten Dollars and an argument to keep from giving me a single cracker. Ras johnson that's the persification of meanness.
RASTUS
I have to be cruel to be kind, when I brought you away from home you was the acme of physical perfection, do you suppose I'm going to allow you to gorge yourself until you become absolutely useless to yourself or any one else a disgruntled, dyspeptic, unfit for the association of respectable people?
(pause)
No Sir!
JASAMINE
(To audience)
Did you ever see a man stick so tight to a cracker? RASTUS
As I was about to say, I have a little secret I want to impart. You remember I caught Fifteen Thousand Dollars in the Louisiana Lottery and paid off a Nine Hundred Dollar mortgage on that 125 acres we have down in Wilson County, Kansas.
 Page 59 of 67


JASAMINE
Umph! Umph!
RASTUS
You know I promised Aunt Cally, Uncle Rube Fowler, Miss Primly and the other girls, I'd take them abroad. JASAMINE
And me-
RASTUS
Of course you, you're here ain't you? Well at first I only figured on going as far as Paris.
JASAMINE
(Dance and Sing)
As I stroll along the Boise-de-Boulogne.
RASTUS
(Slapping Jas on back)
We had a good time in Paris, Eh! Jas?
JASAMINE
(Returning slap with interest)
Go on Donne-Lui Ce qui est La, Madam? Oh pshaw!
RASTUS
That will do how, that will do. As I was saying, I didn't intend to go any further than Paris, but something happened in Paris.
JASAMINE
Yes you got arrested for fighting a French man.
RASTUS
No, no, I mean something important happened
(looks around suspiciously beckons for Jas to come closer.Bus. for Jas)
You know Wilson County is the centre of the oil industry of Kansas, well the biggest oil well in the County
 Page 60 of 67


was discovered within the borders of that 125 acres. Our agent sold the 25 acres surrounding the oil well, for a big bunch of money and I received the coin the day before we left Paris, hence the fresh supply of Mazuma.
JASAMINE
After you give me one of them crackers, there's another secret that's been troubling me more than anything else
(Looks around suspiciously then whisperes)
Why did you leave the Boise-de-Boulogne for the sandy De-Dez?
RASTUS
(Sighes)
Paris is a wonderful place-attractive, luxurious, magnificent who could forget the Palais Royal, Louvre, Luxembourg--
JASAMINE
And the Bois-de-Boulogne.
RASTUS
(Shrugs shoulders, gesticulates like Frenchman)
To pick up my narrative--
JASAMINE
(Interrupting)
If it don't make any difference to you, would you mind picking up a cracker at the same time? RASTUS
(Ignores question)
This fresh supply of money gave me an opportunity to gratify my one life long hobby "Astronomy". JASAMINE
Ras Johnson, you've talked about more funny diseases since you've had money, then any man I've ever seen. Neuritis, Neuroma, Neurosis. Nephritis of the Pedal extremities, Chiropody and now you've got the Hobbyastronomous.
RASTUS
Astronomy isn't a disease, its a sience. Astronomy treats of the heavenly bodies. Considered as to their
 Page 61 of 67


nature, heavenly bodies may be divided into two great classes. Class one-incandescent bodies which shine by their own light. Class twoOpaque bodies which are visable only by reflecting the light of some incandescent body in their neighborhood. Now the three fundemental facts which determine the phenomena of Astronomy are: TheGlobular form of the earth, its diurnal rotation on its axis and its annual revolution around the sun. To represent the position of the stars, astronomers imagine circles on the Celestial sphere, corresponding to the circles of longitude and latitude on the earth. To explain to you longitude and latitude, the Meridian of Greenwich, Celestial meridians and the like, would be a waste of time, but I might be able to interest you----
JASAMINE
(Interrupting)
If you'd just show me the photograph of a cracker---
RASTUS
Now if I should take you at your word and afterward didn't give you the cracker, it's more than likely you would have a serious case of muscular contraction of the oesophagus, in that case, what would you do?
JASAMINE
Say my prayers.
RASTUS
If you'll agree not to interrupt me for five minutes, I may furnish you with a few of these crackers.
JASAMINE
I'll sign the Arimistice.
RASTUS
As I was saying, I might be able to interest you by stating that I lingered a bit in the rear of the Caravan to- day to try an experiment.
JASAMINE
(Interrupting)
I thought---
RASTUS
(Interrupting)
But you are not to think at all and by interrupting me, you have broken your agreement on the cracker question.
 Page 62 of 67


JASAMINE
I appeal from the decision.
RASTUS
I'll give you the crackers if you'll just keep still. JASAMINE
Unconditional surrender.
RASTUS
To resume: I'm going to try an experiment and I know of no better place than here on the Continent where the first authoritative school of astronomy had its birth, I refer to the Alexandrian school. If what I learned of a disciple of this school of of astronomy at Cairo, be true, I shall be able to bring about any weather condition I desire which of course will be a great benefit to Kansas. Change day-light to darkness, darkness to moon- light, moon-light to star light and visa versa
(Jas strats to speak)
Don't interrupt please, my first attempt will be to produce total darkness-
(Looks at gun carefully)
JASAMINE
(Making mock address to audience)
Ladies and gentlemen, with the kind permission of the audience, Rastus Johnson will smother the sun. RASTUS
(Walking down stage two or three steps and fondling gun)
I will now bring about a total eclipse. For your benefit, I will explain what an eclipse is. An eclipse is an obstruction of the light of a heavenly body by another, effected either directly by its intervention between the body and the observer, or indirectly by its interception of the source of light which illuminates the body-
(To Jas)
You understand, don't you?
JASAMINE
(By expression shows he doesn't understand) Oh! yes!

Page 63 of 67


RASTUS
Very well. Of course this being a total eclipse, will be unlike the eclipse of 1928 and 1967. JASAMINE
(With emphasis)
When?
JASAMINE
(Calmly)
1928 and 1967. In these two, the moon's shadow will just graze the pole of the earth. JASAMINE
In 1928 and 1967
RASTUS
In 1928 and 1967.
JASAMINE
Excuse me PRoffessor, but ain't this 1905?
RASTUS
This is A.D. 1905.
JASAMINE
(Looks intently at Ras, then to audience)
Decision reserved until the mental responsibility of the defendant has been established. RASTUS
That you are skeptical, does not surprise me at all, but as in all cases where sience is conserned, people of your mental calibre, must have an ocular demonstration, and that I shall try to give you by first conteracting the calorific rays of the sun, thereby causing an unusual humidity--
JASAMINE (Interrupting)
Further explanation unaccompanied by ocular demonstration will not be tolerated. According to Hoyle, the best proof of the pudding is the eating, so let's taste.
 Page 64 of 67


RASTUS
(Raising gun and pointing upward and off stage in L.2.E.) Stand behind me and observe.-
(Fires gun the report of which must be very light-louder reports to follow off stage about ten seconds laterthen the gradual lowering of the lights. When about two thirds down, insert colored medium until total darknessRas and Jas stand with back to audience Ras produces small pocket lamp which he lights)
JASAMINE
I'm awful glad you sprung that light, I ain't skeered, but Ha! ha!
(Without humor)
I-I you know I jes' naturally when the sun-when the sun say ain't there some way you can use the best part of the sun for your experiment and let me have the rest of it?
RASTUS
(Excitedly pointing upward)
See!
JASAMINE
(Frightened)
Who! What! Where?
RASTUS
The stars one by one are peeping from the firmament.
JASAMINE
I wish they wouldn't be so bashful and come right out, no excuse for peeping when there ain't nobody to-- RASTUS
(Interrupting)
Ah!
(Long drawn)
There's Luna also.
JASAMINE

Page 65 of 67


(Inquiringly)
Who's loony?
RASTUS
The moon
(Enthused)
Isn't it beautiful?
JASAMINE
(Pantomines to audience that Ras is crazy and conveys the idea that he (Jas) is humoring him by showing great interest looks intently at the moon and raptuously exclaims)
LovelyLovely.
(Pause then)
Say Ras, you ain't forgot them crackers, have you? RASTUS
Wait a minute
(Fires gunlight report as before, followed about five seconds later by loud report off stage one of the stars takes on the appearance of a comet the same to be repeated two or three times drop must be made transparent and lights worked from behind)
Try your gun, but be careful not to fire in the direction of the moon. JASAMINE
You said try your gun and I presume you mean for me to alter the appearance of one of the stars and I have selected that Lumminary
(Pointing to star nearest the moon)
next to Luna so stand back and take note of the experiment.
(Shoots light report from gun followed immediately by several loud reports off stage moon increases in sizepicture in moon Bus. & etc.)
RASTUS
You've made a mess of everything, now I'll be compelled to reverse the present condition.
(Shoots all lights go out)
 Page 66 of 67


JASAMINE
(Excited)
Say Ras, light that light again.
(Ras produces pocket lamp just then chicken crows off stage)
Ras are you going to give me some of them crackers?
RASTUS
Here, take all of them
(Gives crackers to Jas again the chicken crows louder and louder this time)
JASAMINE
Rastus Johnson, do you hear that voice calling out in the wilderness?
(Takes light, picks up stone, leaves stage R.2. E. Ras watching lights come up slowly until full up Bus. catching chicken. Jas returns with chicken)
RASTUS
You've got keen ears, Jasamine Jenkins.
JASAMINE
I'd a knowed that voice in the middle of the Red Sea, Rastus Johnson. RASTUS
Come we'll depart, Jasmine Jenkins.
JASAMINE
Lead on, we'll follow
(Holding up chicken followexit to music)
