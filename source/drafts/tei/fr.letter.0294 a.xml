<p>Copy.</p>
    
<p>"On November 30., at the post of Uere, a young girl
in the service of a Belgian sergeant was flogged in public
by his orders. The man who administered the flagellation,
after a short time refused to continue the operation,
where upon the sergeant produced his revolver and 
threatened to shoot him. When the flesh had been cut into 
ribbons, the girl was tied to a flagestaff in the center
of the Station. The sergeant then procured some native
honey, and with his own hands covered portions of 
the girl's body with the substance, and she was left in
the burning sun without anything to sustain her during
a whole day. In the evening the sergeant was warned that
if the girl were not released and given food and water
she would certainly die. It was not, however, until 
the following day that the woman was freed from her
bonds and taken to the native quarters, where she died
the same night. A Belgian doctor, who had just arrived
at the post, saw her when at the point of death and beyond
all medical aid, but made no report to the authorities 
of what he had seen and heard".</p>

<p>Quoted from page XXII (22) of the Introduction by John
George Leigh to "The Curse of Central Africa" by Capt. 
Guy Burrows: under date of Feby. 1903.</p>
    
<p>The context would make the date "November 30" to be in
1896.</p>
