<p>To the Honorable 
James D. Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington</p>
    
<p>Sir
I have just received "Shoe
+ Leather Circular dated April
6th 1886, and at there are no statistics
at hand or indeed available
to import information Jean
only reply from impressions
derived from long experience.</p>
    
<p>There are probably no articles
of American leather manufacture
used in Senegal at present.
<unclear/> 1878 an American merchant 
named Matthew Bartlett sent
two or three small Invoices
of light fancy shoes + slippers
which sold well, but on his 
retirement from the business
which happened two or three</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_133732"/>

<p>years later all such shipments 
were discontinued.
The only American Merchant
now doing business reguarly in
Senegal in FC Butman E6q. N
34 Central St.Balton. All others
have either failed up or been
driven off by European competition.
Mr. Butman for reasons which
will appear hereafter has hitherto
made no shipments of articles
of leather manufacture.</p>

<p>There is at present no 
demand for leather in Senegal,
but of Shoes the Consumption
is quite large and rapidly increasing.
Still finds are in request, but
light fancy shoes are most wanted.
small sizes are wanted, but 
for the most part they should
be medium inclined to small.
Very long huled plantation
feel are not prevalent in
this part of Africa.
The principal reason</p>
  
<pb facs="20170619_133739"/>  
<p>why shoes cannot with advantage
be exported from America to Africa
lies in the fact that excepting to 
a very limited extent as in the case
of Hides + Bubber, Americans commet
take the produce of the country in 
payment. American vessels consequently 
earn scarcly any freifht commanders,
so that an outward voyage only
can be counted on to pay all
expenses and yield a profit. 
American Merchants under such 
conditions can only handle at a 
living profit a few staples,
generally not much manufactured
that are peculiary American, 
such as Tobacco, Lumber, <unclear></unclear>
and same kinds of provisions.
It is next to impossible without
taking produce in payment, as
Europeans do to complete successfully
against goods of European manufacture.
Our Merchants are now obliged
to deal only with the large 
European Houses who can give </p>    
    
<pb facs="20170619_133744"/>
<p>Bills in payment and most
of these large houses being always 
stocked with Goods of European 
manufacture which they are compelled
to receive from their principals in
Europ are of courses kenly interested
to keep competing American Goods
out of the market.</p>  
   
<p>The principal production 
of Senegambia is peanuts, of
which 7,000,000 bushels are said to 
be exported to Europe annually.
For a few years subsequent to our
Civil War a portion of this peanut
trade in spite of our high tariff,
was diverted to the United States.
All our vessels then carried full
and paying cargoes homewards,
which enabled our merchants to
deal with traders of small means,
and introduce new articles in
spite of the <unclear/> of the 
large European Houses. Senegal
parts were at that time
much frequented by American</p>
   
<pb facs="20170619_133754"/>   
<p>vessels, and the business for 
all engaged in it including
Merchants, Shipowners, Agents,
Manufacturers and Supercagoes
was thriving. But in time 
the wide margin of 32 cts
per bushel affordd American 
Nutgrowers by are protective 
tariff had its effect and 
Africans disappeared gradually
from our markets. Simultaneously
our West African trade began
to languish for lack of return
cargoes, until are American
Concern after another was
obliged to withdraw with their 
vessels from a business which 
under the changed circumstances
could no longer yield them 
a living profit. Whether 
the notion has on the whole
been a gainer by paying
for the creation of a nut
<unclear/> within its borders
at the expense of many</p>   
    
<pb facs="20170619_133806"/>
<p>Perhaps I should state
before clubing that the shoes
now current here are of French 
<unclear/> and no dearer than 
ours. But they lack the 
style and finish that was
house and on strictly even
terms I am sure they could
not compete. It is also
worthy of note that children
shoes are etting to be used 
in considerable quantities
which perhaps more than
any other cirucmstances indicates
that there will soon be
an increase in the quantity
wanted. The prevalence of 
Chigres a species of flea.
Which had lately been imported
from the West Indies and
burrows in the toes of the 
natives when supposed is 
also having considerable 
influence to compel the 
wearing of shoes among them.</p>   
   
<pb facs="20170619_133758"/>
<p>other important induties
it is of course not my 
province to determine. I 
simply stae the facts
which have come under
my observation, because 
they have a practical
bearing on the questions 
I am expected to <unclear/>.</p>   
    
<p>Probably however the 
American nugrowing insterest 
is now so well established
that if the duty which has 
<unclear/> it were repeated
to murown the receipts of the 
farmerrs would suffer no 
sensible diminition, vechile
if American Merchants could 
only be enbaled to ship enough
of nuts to ballast their vessels 
it might give them a hold 
of this market sufficient
to control it for all articles
in the manufacture of which 
Americans are appeared to expeal.</p>
 
<pb facs="20170619_133812"/> 
 
<p>Finally, there seems
to be no reason but the one 
referred to why American 
Shoe dealers should not 
find as profitable market
here for their wares as in
any other foreign country, 
of like population and 
renounced. It will perhaps 
be a century before the 
Senegatint begin to 
manufacture shoes for 
themselves, but then
purchasing dispabition
and capacity are
importing everyday.
I have the honor to be
Very truly Your
Peter Stuckland
U.S. Consul</p>
