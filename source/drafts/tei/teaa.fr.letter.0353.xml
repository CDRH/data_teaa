<p>Department of State,<lb/>
Washington, September 11, 1885.</p>
    
<p>Mr. Edmond van Eetvelde,
Administrator General of the Department
of Foreign Affairs of the Independent
State of the Congo,
Brussels.</p>
    
<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of the 1st
ultimo, in which you are pleased to 
proffer, through me, to the Government
of the United States of America, an 
official guarantee of the neutrality
of the newly constituted Independent
State of the Congo, and whereby you
acquaint me with the boundary demarkation
of the new State.</p>
    
<p>I observe that this proffered
    
<pb n="teaa.fr.letter.0353.002.jpg"/>

guarantee of neutrality is made by
you in conformity with Article 10
of the General Act of the Conference
of Berlin.</p>
    
<p>The Government of the United 
States having been represented by
Delegates in that Conference under
the expressed reservations of the right,
in its sovereign discretion thereafter
to accede or withhold its accession,
to the result of its deliberations, it
will not be possible for me to determine
the due and proper weight to be given 
by this Government to the declaration
and territorial claims thus communicated
by you on behalf of the Independent
State of the Congo, so far
as such declaration and claim 
rest on the provisions of that General
Act, until the United States shall, 
by subsequent accession, and ratifi- <fw type="catch">cation</fw>
    
<pb n="teaa.fr.letter.0353.003.jpg"/>    

of the said General Act of the
Conference of Berlin, in the manner
therein provided and according to their
constitutional forms, become a party
to the stipulation thereof.</p>
    
<p>The relationship of cordial 
recognition and earnest good will,
heretofore initiated by the Government
of the United States toward the International
Association of the Congo,
and now confirmed and, I trust,
perpetuated in respect of the new
Independent State which succeeds
to that Association, is, however, complete
of itself and apart from any
conventional relationship flowing
from or defined by the General
Act of the Conference of Berlin; and
the obligation to respect the precepts
of neutrality and friendly intercourse
is held by the Government of the
    
<pb n="teaa.fr.letter.0353.004.jpg"/> 

United States to be as perfect toward
the sovereign and Independent State 
of the Congo as toward any and 
all sovereignties with which the
United States maintain friendship
and intercourse.</p>
    
<p>Accept, Sir, the renewed
assurance of my highest consideration.</p>
    
<p>T. F. Bayard</p>
