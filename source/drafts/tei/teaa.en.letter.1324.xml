<p>No. 42/1901, Miscellaneous
Consulate General of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
October 17, 1901.</p>

<p>To the Honorable
The Special Commissions,
Monrovia, Liberia.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:
In reply to the printed
list of questions a copy of which
is herewith attached that you
submitted to me, in common with other
foreign Consular representatives
residing near this Government in
July last to answer, touching the very
important matter therein contained,
I have the honor to advise
you that in answering same as I
am not empowered to act nor
instructed by my Government upon
this very important matter, I can
only answer your questions as my
own observation, experience
an opinions in commercial
intercourse with other great Nations
and</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4151.jpg"/>

<p>and not as that of my Government, hence
I am answering your questions seriation
as follows;</p>

<p>1. Yes. Let vessels be registered under
the Liberian Flag by Liberian Consuls
abroad under proper restrictions.
2. A feeling of insecurity exists,
especially financial responsibility.
3. Have your monetary system in dollars
cents_gold standard
maintaining between paper dollars
and gold dollars.
4. The Free trade conditions are made
with the revenue of the country fully
protected, the more likelyhood of
trade increaseing.
5. Dashes are in the nature of
of bribes and should be abolished
everywhere.
6. Yes. Would recommend the
Metric System.
7. Yes, Tonnage dues should be
a maximum amount each fiscal
year divided into multiple payments
payable on each entry at
any</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4152.jpg"/>

<p>any Liberian Port of entry. Any unmade
payment during the fiscal year to
lapse. In connection with this
question I have to call your attention
to the fact that in order to
encourage Commerce, the Liberian
Government has very thoughtfully
and generously relinquished
the charges and dues for anchorage,
lights and tonnage upon
European steam vessels calling
at Liberian Ports carrying the Liberian
and Foreign mails in lieu of said
changes and dues; and in order
to encourage American
steam and sail vessels calling
at Liberian ports, as in the case
of the "Yates and Porterfield Trading
Company" of New York, carrying on
a large Mercantile business
in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and
the said company having but
recently rented business
apartments on Water street and
river front in Monrovia with
a view</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4153.jpg"/>

<p>view to an early reestablishment
of business in this city, I would
most respectfully ask, petition,
and recommend to your
commission that whereas the said
"Yates and Porterfield Trading Company"
of New York, operates a fleet of
several sailing vessels that
whenever the first arrival of
one of their vessels occur for
the fiscal year that that first
arrived vessel be requested
to pay a full annual tonnage
of 50 cents, per ton burden,
for the fiscal year, and
that the said or subsequent
vessels of the said "Yates and
Porterfield Trading Company," be
allowed to call as frequently
as they may see fit and
enter as many Liberian ports
as they the said company
may see fit to dispatch them,
without another or further
payment of anchorage, light
or</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4154.jpg"/>

<p>or tonnage charge or dues during
 the same fiscal year except in
the case of a subsequent vessel
being of a greater tonnage burden
than the one paying the
Annual charges and dues,
in which case the subsequent
vessel shall pay any excess
of tonnage dues to the
Liberian Government.
8. Yes.
9. Yes. Believing foreign concessions
to be detrimental to the country.
10. Increase them if possible
upon improved modern
scientific principles.
11. No. Restricted immigration
is the most desirable and profitable
to the country.
12. Cable communication would
be a benefit also telegraphic and
telephonic communication
between the capital, the several
ports of entry and the more important
interior towns and
settlements</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4155.jpg"/>

<p>settlements so that the head
of the Government can be
communicated with at any time
and at the shortest possible
moment, would very materially
inprove the commercial interest
of the country. Again improve
the harbor at Monrovia by
building a <unclear>buakirater</unclear> off
Cape Messerado as well as
fostering an attempt to
establish steam or sail
communication between the
United States and the Republic
of Liberia.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
yours &amp;c.
Owen L. W. Smith.</p>

<p>SPECIAL COMMISSIONERS' ROOM.</p>

<p>MONROVIA, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1901.</p>

<p>Sir,
I am directed by the Special Commissioners, to submit the following
questions for your consideration; and to respectfully reqeust your answer in
writing to the same, at an early a date possible.</p>

<p>I am Sir,
Yours &amp;c., &amp;c.
D. FRANCIS WARE,
SECRETARY.</p>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>QUESTIONS.</p>

<p>1. Do you think the commerce of Liberia would be improved by adopting ay policy other than
those already adopted, if so what would you suggest?
2. What is your opinion as to the condition of trade and commerce in Liberia, especially as they
effect foreign traders and merchants?
3. What would you recommend as a change of policy and measures for the better protection of
capital in the commerce of the country?
4. Do you think there is a sufficient number of "Ports of Entry" on the coast for the betterment
of trade and commerce, and would recommend the opening of the entire coast to foreign traders
and merchants,--in that case where should the duties be paid?
5. What is your opinion respecting the high dashes paid to chiefs and town people on the coast
both by foreign and Liberian merchants and traders in the face of licenses already paid to
Government?
6. In your opinion, should there not be a uniform system of weights and measures on the coast,
regulated by government as adopted in the regular ports of entry?
7. In your opinion are the charges on transient vessels for light, anchorage and tonnage
dues excessive?
8. Do you think a regularly constituted Board of Trade in every county would be
advantageous to the trade in general in Liberia, and what would you suggest or
recommend?
9. Do you think that by opening the interior to resident foreign traders and merchants
in Liberia, it would aid the development of the trade of the country?
10. Have you any suggestions to offer with regard to the agricultural industries of
Liberia, with a view to improvement in the cultivation of cocoa, cocoanuts, coffee, rubber,
corn, cotton, peas and other products?
11. Is the shipping of Labourers from Liberia to foreign ports beneficial to the commercial
and agricultural interests of the country?
12. Give us your opinion on matters pertaining to trade, agriculture, and other matters
of general interest?</p>
