<p>No 1.</p>

<p>Department of State<lb/>
Monrovia, March 16th 1888<lb/>
Liberia, W. C. A.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your communication
of the 24th ult., transmitting
to me by order of the 
Secretary of State of the United States
a copy of a despatch from the
Consul General of the United States
at Panama, in regard to reported
disturbances or disorders on the
line of the Panama Canal, in which
Liberian citizens are said to have
been concerned.</p>

<p>In reply Sir, permit me to
inform you that the copy of the
important despatch above cited,
has been with its enclosures
<catchwords>enclosure</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1253.jpg"/>

enclosures carefully perused by
my Government, and after a
due consideration has been
given to the matter, it is the
opinion of the Liberian Government
that the impression of
Consul General Adamson, as
to the countries to which the
so called Liberians really
belong, are correct, for the
following reasons.</p>

<p>1st It is not the custom of
Kroomen or other natives of
Liberia, when shipping to work
in a foreign country, or even to work
along the Coast to take their war
customs with them. The fact being
that they take away next to
nothing but like to return in
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1254.jpg"/>

in opposite condition. Furthermore
the Liberian natives shipping
for work at Panama, had their
outfit of clothing furnished by
the Company's Agent, at the time
of entering into the service of the
Company.</p>

<p>2nd The natives of Liberia are
notorious for their peaceful and
orderly demeanor, whilst away
from their homes and in a
foreign country, they are as a
general rule very careful to
avoid any conflict with the
laws of the country in which
they are residing, which would
tend to curtail their liberty of
departure at the period fixed
for their return to their homes.
<catchwords>I have</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1255.jpg"/>

I have therefore to request, that you
will be kind enough to convey to
the Government of the United States,
the thanks of that of Liberia for the
unabated interest it continues
to exhibit for the welfare of Liberian
citizens at present residing on the
Isthmus of Panama, and, also
convey to your Government the
conclusion in which this Department
is in accord with Consul General
Adamson, that the parties who
were said to have been engaged
in the commission of disorder
at Panama, are not natives of
Liberia, but belong to the more
intractable tribes situated to the
North and South of Liberian
