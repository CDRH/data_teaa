<pb n="Roll3-1179.jpg"/>

I addressed to the Secretary of State a note, copy of which is transmitted herewith, and marked "enclosure No. 1" in which I requested the permission of this Government to be extended to Mr. J. J. Cheeseman to be Acting Commercial Agent of the United States, instead of Mr. Crusoe, resigned. It appears from the reply of Secretary Blacklidge, Copy of which is marked "enclosure No. 2," – that there are on the part of this Government, objections to Mr. Cheeseman's being permitted to act in that capacity. My recognition of those objections may be found by reference to enclosures 3. 5. of this despatch Enclosure No. 7. relates to my tender of the <catchwords>position</catchwords>

position to H. A. Williams, Esqr. a citizen of Grand Bassa, engaged in mercantile business in that County. As soon as Mr. Williams can be heard from, I will, if he accepts the position, ask the permission of this Government to be extended to him to act in that capacity, and report the result to the Department.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
