<p>Grover Clevelad
President of the United States
of America.</p>
    
<p>To His Majesty
Leopold
Sovereign of the Independent
State of the Congo</p>
    
<p>Esteemed and Great Friend:</p>
    
<p>I have had much
pleasure in receiving Your
Majesty's letter of the 1st of 
August last, announcing
that the possessions of the
International Association
of the Congo will henceforth
form the Independent State
of the Congo, and that Your
Majesty, under the authorization</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>of the Belgian Legislation
Chambers, and in accord with 
the Association, has assumed
the title of Soverign of the
Independent State of the Congo.</p>
    
<p>I observe Your Majesty's 
further statement that the 
connection between Belgium
and the new State is exclusively
personal.</p>
    
<p>This Government at the 
outlet testified its lively
interest in the well-being and
future progress of the vast
region now committed to
Your Majesty's wise care, by
being the first among the Powers
to reconize the flag of the 
International Association
of the Congo as that of a 
friendly State,-and now
that progress of events</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>has brought with it the general
recognition of the jurisdiction
of the Association and opened
the way for its incorporation
as an independent and sovereign
State, I have great satisfaction
in congratulating Your Majesty
on being called to the
Chief Magistracy of the newly
formed Government. The Government
and People of the United
States, whose only concern
lies in watching with benevolent
expectation the growth
of prosperity and peace among
the communities to whom 
they are joined by ties of
friendship, cannot doubt that
under Your Majety's good
Government the peoples of
the Congo region will advance</p>
    
<p>the paths of civilization and
deserve the good will of all
those States and people who
may be brought into contact
with them.</p>
    
<p>I am, my esteemed
and Great Friend,</p>
    
<p>Your faithful Friend,
Grover Cleveland,</p>
    
<p>Done at Washington, this
11th day of September 1885.</p>
    
<p>By the President:
T.F. Bayard
Secretary of State.</p>
