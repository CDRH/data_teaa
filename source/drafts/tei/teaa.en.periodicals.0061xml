<div2 type="Literature">
<p>Tropical Africa," by Professor Henry Drummond, will great-
   ly interest and instruct all classes of readers. It is not strictly a book
   of travels or of science, but in a charming style Professor Drum-
   mond details briefly what he saw in his excursion up the Zambezi,
   crossing lake Nyasa to the high plateau between Nyasa and Tangan-
   yika. Professor Drummond evidently believes in the African and
   in the possibilities of a development within the bounds of his own
   Continent. This is altogether a charming book; and its six colored</p>

<p>maps of Central and Southern Africa are worth more than the price
   of the volume.

    "Emin Pasha in Central Africa," is one of the most fascina-
   ting as well as valuable books relating to Africa; and a remarkable
   fact connected with it is, that though the author, so far as known, is
   not only alive but in active service, he is not even aware of the exist-
   ence of the volume. In the centre of his Equatorial Province Emin
   Pasha has been practically shut away form the world, and for years
   at a time he has recieved no communication from without. But he
   has nevertheless been able to send to his special friends, Professors
   Schweinfurth and Ratzel, and Doctors Felkin and Hartlaub, letters
   which have reached them, and which they feel to be of such value to
   the world that they have arranged and presented them in this comely
   volume of 547 pages. The journals cover the period from 1877 to
   April, 1887, although there are many gaps. The contributions to nat-
   ural history contained in this volume would be sufficient to give fame
   to any man but when we add to this the service of Emin Pasha as a 
   military leader and governor, and his protracted and energetic efforts
   for the suppression of the slave-trade and the amelioration of the
   condition of the people of the Equatorial Province, we are constrain-
   ed to admit that he is one of the most wonderful men of our times.

   The story of his life is briefly given, from which we learn that his
   real name is Eduard Schnitzer, the son of Protestants, born in Op-
   peln, Silesia, in 1840. After obtaining a medical education at Berlin,
   he sought practice in Turkey, traveling through Armenia, Syria and 
   Arabia. He entered the Egyptian service in 1876 and became chief 
   medical officer of the Equatorial Province under General Gordon.
   It was there that he assumed the name of Emin Effendi, for the pur-
   pose of removing all obstacles to his intercourse with the natives, at
   the same time assuring his friends that "an honest German is disguis-
   ed behind the Turkish name. Don't be afraid ; I have only adopted
   the name. I have not become a Turk." Aside from his extraordinary
   gifts in scientific studies, Dr. Emin has remarkable ability in the ac-
   quisition of languages so that he not only speaks the principal lan-
   guages of Europe, but has mastered several Slavonic tonguese as well
   as the Turkish and Arabic. His acquisitions in the line of language
   in Central Africa must be a matter of conjecture.

    It was in 1878 that Gordon made Emin governor of the Equato-
   rial Province, and the new ruler immediately undertook to redeem
   the district from the domination of slave-traders. With great energy
   and patience he wrought until he had trained a native soldiery
   and had banished the slave-traders from the Province; and in 1882</p>

<pb xml:id="17-20" facs="African Repository 1889.1.1 - Progress in Africa.pdf"/>

<p>he was able to show a net profit through his administration of $40,000
   in place of the preceeding annual defici of not far from $160,000. Re-
   garding his administrative duties as of prime importance, he never
   suffered his intense love for scientific investigations to interfere with
   his work as a ruler. While throughout these letters to his friends
   there is a singular mingling of records of his administration with ac-
   counts of the wonderful flora and fauna of the Province, it is clear
   that his heart is first of all fixed upon securing good government for
   the people over whom he is placed. Dr. Hartlaub, referring to the 
   zoological collections and observations which Emin Pasha has made,
   declares that they are astonishing in the highest degree. But they
   cannot be more astonishing than are the results of his administration
   among the people. To be sure, in the troubles that ensured after 1882,
   and in the enlargement of his domain, the slave trade was again re-
   vived and Dr. Emin, having no help from without found it impossible to
   restrain the rapacity and lust of the slae dealers in the new districts
   committed to his care. But he has patiently wrough at his work,
   dealing with the people in wise and just ways, and has won their re-
   gard to a surprising degree  And now this wise and brave man stands
   at his post, unwilling to leave it even were some broad way opened
   for him to flee from a trust which he would gladly lay down if a stern
   conviction of duty would allow him so to do.

   "German Work in Africa" is a book of interest concerning
   the "Dark Continent". It is by Goyaux, the well-known German traveler,
   and-is far superior to the ordinary literature on that subject. It is
   mostly the result of years of observation and practical experience of
   the author, and therein has special worth. It is written largely as an 
   aid to the present efforts of the Germans in the line of African 
   colonization. One chapter is devoted to the climate of German
   Africa, and in this author has no very satifactory experience. He
   says: "German Africa will never be the seat of large emigration; on-
   ly individual Germans who go there under the most favorable condi-
   tions, as merchants, overseers of workmen, or government officials,
   will be able to remain long." The third section is devoted to the sub-
   ject of plantations in tropical Africa. Here we learn in full the nec-
   essary modus operandi of clearing the ground and preparing the soil
   with labor there at command, and establishing experimental agri-
   cultural colonies. The chapter on the education of the natives is val-
   uable, as it is the practical experience of the author of several years
   labor on a large plantation. Suffice it to say on this point that he
   considers the Nero capable of beign educated, but the instruction</p>

<pb xml:id="17-20" facs="African Repository 1889.1.1 - Progress in Africa.pdf"/>

<p>must be wholly practical-must be virtually object-teaching on a large
   scale. The African is imitative, but his ambition must be stimulated,
   and much patience is necessary to success.

   "The Arab in Central Africa" is an interesting pamphlet
   by James Stevenson, Esq, who has heretofore written in reference to
   philanthropic and commercial enterprises in Central Africa. He 
   brings together many facts which show that within the last five years
   the ravages of the Arabs have increased in area and intensity, so that a 
   territory west of the great Lakes, one thousand miles by four hun-
   red, has been devastated. It is a sorrowful story of the growth of the
   slave trade, and the statements here brought together give force to 
   the representation s made to the British government, urging it to in
   terpose in the defence of the rights of commerce in the interior of Af-
   rica Mr. Stevenson's pamphlet is accompanied by a map of Africa,
   showing the lines on which the slave-trade is now prosecuted.

   "Life on the Congo" by Rev. W. Holman Bentley, contains
   much that is valuable on the physical characteristics and climate of
   the country, the home life and superstitions of the natives, the expe-
   rience of the missionaries, and some of the results of their labors. It
   is not yet ten years since the first missionaries arrived in the country,
   and yet already there are native Christian churches at Mukimbungu,
   Lukunaga, Banza, Manteka and San Salvador: there beign about 1,500
   converts, whose sincerity is attested by the self-denial and consistency
   of their lives.

   "Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language," by
   Rev. W. Holman Bentley, is another monument to missionary enter-
   prise. In its 718 pages it presents to the world the materi-
   als for understanding and African language spoken in a vast district
   bordering on the Congo river (which this author writes Kongo.) It
   must prove an invaluable assistance to all who are engaged in com-
   mercial or missionary enterprises within the Congo Free State.

   There are now three periodicals in Europe which are wholly de-
   voted to African news and comments upon the various enterprises de-
   veloping there, while three-fourths of the space in another journal is 
   given solely to affairs in the Congo State. One of these periodicals
   has a circulation of six thousand copies. L'Afrique, which is publish-
   ed in Geneva, and the African Times, of London, have ben in the 
   field for several years, and now come the Afrika Post, issued in 
   Hamburg, to be chiefly devoted to Germany's interests in her African
   possessions.</p>
