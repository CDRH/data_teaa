<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to
transmit to you the intelligence
that the schedule of the
English Steamers, from Liverpool
to Monrovia, has been
recently, so changed that we
shall now have only one
Steamer per month from
Liverpool. At the same
time we have a Steamer
sailing weekly from
Hamburg, calling at Monrovia.
The German Steamers
make, by far the fastest
time. If it is possible that
you can so arrange with
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll6-3048.jpg"/>

the Post Office Department at
New York, so as to forward
mail matters for Liberia, by
way of Hamburg, you will
greatly facilitate, as well as,
accelerate its transit.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be your
obedient servant,<lb/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<lb/>
M. R. and C. General.</p>
