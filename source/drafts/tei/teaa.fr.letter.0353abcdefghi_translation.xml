<p>international... not restrained
thereby the rights of a State.
This one is major,
in the expanse of its
sovereignty, to regulate
such materials that it
judges appropriate, and
to take such struggle of
measures that it believes useful.
To the rest, we predict
that the dispositions of the
Decree are precisely
of public order: it is
in the well known interest
of the boats and of their
crews, and to spare
themselves from unfortunate conflicts
with the indigenous that
we oblige them to
display their colors:
Mr. Sambert Free
denies that this is there a
measure of police: we
affirm, the contrary
and we alone are
competent to determine
the character,</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>recognizing only the
populations that we govern,
and <unclear/>
alone the way of
conducting it.</p>
    
<p>Its note seems
to say that we destroyed
our right to
display the flag of the
Congo, of the fact, cited
by us, that, often,
the boats - <unclear>bissent</unclear>
of the foreign flags,
only do this by
courtesy. By no means.
We invoked
this circumstance simply
to establish
that the obligation that
we impose was not
necessarily an
attainment brought to the
national dignity, but
it has its base in
our incontestable right
of police</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>police belonging to all
State in its territories
and legitimates these two measures
taken by us: to
display the flag of the
Congo and to demand the
proof of nationality
of the boats. No
principle of international right,
to our
knowledge, restrains
the sovereign rights to
this double point of view
4. Its most authorized
authors in regard
to international right,
Bluntsebli, Hesster,
Perels, de Martens, Raiser,
Travers <unclear></unclear>, etc are
unanimous on this point
that the boats finding
themselves in the foreign
territorial waters
must submit themselves
to the laws of the country where they
find themselves ( <unclear></unclear> Bluntsebli
International Right</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>codified. Articles 319, 323, 
260- Perels. Manual
of international maritime right
<unclear></unclear> 13 
all equally recognize
the right for
a Power to <unclear>séjourer</unclear>
the nationality of a
boat displaying a
foreign flag in
demanding the production
of the vessels papers or
regular documents.
(Bluntsebli, 327-326
-Hsster 379-Perels S7)-
It is a principle so 
solidly established that
the absence of regular
papers can cause
suspicion of a boat
of piracy. Each
country determines the
conditions to which
it confers its nationality,
but also determines the conditions
to which it recognize</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>the nationality of the
foreign boats navigating
in its territorial
waters. It is
of universal use that
the maritime authorities
at the arrival of the boats
in the ports, reclaim
the vessels papers, and
the majority of the countries impose
(notably the
United States) to their <unclear></unclear>
the obligation to
target these papers by
their consul. This use
is even formally
consecrated by the treaty
between the United States and
Belgium, and, argument
even more
striking, the protocols of
the Act of Berlin, 
invoked by the Minister
of the United States, show
clearly that the intention
of the Plenipotentiaries,
of accord in that with</p>
    
<p>modern right was
that the nationality is
proven by the vessels
papers.</p>
    
<p>The affirmation of
Mr. Lambert Free
is <unclear>done</unclear> maybe daring,
while he advances
that no rule of
international right
imposes the obligation
to be equipped with the vessels
papers; just as
while he declares that
the flag displayed by
a boat justifies
the nationality of a
<unclear>vessel</unclear> as it would do
a letter of sea or
other document. The
flag is only an
exterior sign, a
symbol; but the
actual proof of the</p>
    
<p>Si protocol. Propostition
of the Marquis of Penafiel</p>
 
 <pb></pb>
    
<p>nationality consists in
the vessels papers. The
other proof, recalled
by the note, of Mr.
Lambert Free, as
the act of commerce, the
testimonial proof, can
establish ownership, or
point of view of the private
right, but only ineffective
to establish the nationaltiy
in the point of view of the
public right.</p>
    
<p>It would be useless
to enter in a discussion
with legation of the United
States on the subject of
the interpretation of the texts
of the american law.
We oppose there a
flee to not receive
prior to knowing
the foreign law
stops at the borders
and has no authority
in other countries,
unless it</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>is the expression of a
principle of international right
. It can
suit the United States
to recognize as
belonging to their
navy and having the
right to display the
american flag,
certain boats not
equipped with maritime
documents, but they
can not go without
imposing this recognition
in the countries that they
do not directly put
to control the
declared nationality.</p>
    
<p>In retaining
to the boats
justifying americans
the right to display their
national flag, we
do not meet
the argument of M.
Lambert Free,
know that the boats</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>in displaying the flag
of the Congo, will be supposed to
belong to the navy
of the State of the Congo.
The argument falls in the
wrong as these boats
will equally display
the american flag.</p>

<p>The note will be able to
cease in maintaining
our letter from the
28th of january and in recalling
we were showing ourselves to be
disposed to study the
modifications proposed by
the American
government on the
exterior disposition
of the flags. The
government of the
Congo takes cognizance of the
sentiments of sympathy
expressed by the legations
of the United States with regard
to the Congo, and professes
its absolute intention</p>
