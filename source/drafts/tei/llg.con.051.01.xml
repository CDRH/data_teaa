<head type="main">Stanley's Africa Then and Now</head>

<head type="sub">By James M. Hubbard</head>

<p>The tenth of November, 1871, is the
most notable day in the history of Equatorial
Africa. For on that day took
place the meeting between two men,
Livingstone and Stanley, on which depended
the future of that vast region:
whether it should remain, as it ever
had been, "Darkest Africa," or whether
the light of civilization should dawn
upon its night. To have seen the two,
one would never have dreamed that the
fate of millions hung upon their meeting.
Livingstone was a prematurely
old man, so nearly worn out by the
hardships of a most strenuous life that
in a few months his faithful followers
would find" the great master," as they
called him, kneeling at the side of his
bed, dead. Stanley was a young man
of thirty, whose sole aim in the meeting
was to get material for the newspapers
of which he was the correspondent.
But his previous career was such as to
render him capable of any task which
required simply resourcefulness, energy,
and faithfulness to duty.</p>

<gap reason="sampling" extent="about ten paragraphs"/>

<p>After leaving <placeName key="uga" n="mapped"><country type="nation">Uganda</country></placeName>, Stanley went
to the headwaters of the <placeName key="riv.con" n="mapped"><geogName type="river">Congo</geogName></placeName> and
followed the river in its downward
course, until, three years after leaving
the Indian Ocean, he gazed upon the
Atlantic. His work of exploration was
done; now for the harder task, civilization.
"That was henceforth the main
purpose and passion of his life," writes
Lady Stanley. "For him, the quest
of wider knowledge meant a stage
toward the betterment of mankind.
He had laid open a tract comparable in
extent and resources to the basin of the
Amazon, or the Mississippi. What his
vision saw, what his supreme effort was
given to, was the transformation of its
millions of people from barbarism, oppressed
by all the ills of ignorance, superstition,
and cruelty, into happy and
virtuous men and women. His aim was
as pure and high as Livingstone's. But
as a means, he looked not alone to the
efforts of isolated missionaries, but to
the influx of great tides of beneficent
activities."</p>

<p>At first he had hoped that the
English people would seize the grand
opportunity which had come within
their grasp. He spoke in all the great
commercial centres of the kingdom,
setting forth the immense advantages
to trade in the opening of this magnificent
country with its well-watered
soil, now neglected, but richer than any
in the Mississippi Valley. But the government
and the people turned a deaf
ear to his appeals, and he was obliged
to accept the offers of King Leopold of
Belgium, who had become deeply interested
in African possibilities. Stanley's
work as founder of the Congo State,
the greatest single enterprise of his life,
occupied five and a half years, January,
1879, to June, 1884. Twelve months
alone were spent in building a road over
mountains and along precipices around
the succession of cataracts and rapids
which separate the navigable part of
the river from the sea. Hammer and
drill in his hand, he showed his men
how to use their tools, and they called
him Bula Matari, "breaker of rocks";
a name which has been graven on his
tomb as most fitly characterizing "his
central quality - concentrated energy
victoriously battling with the hardest
that earth could offer, all to make earth
goodly and accessible to man." During
a year and a half he negotiated treaties
with over four hundred chiefs, established
stations for a thousand miles
along the Upper Congo, and did his
best to abolish the slave-trade and put
an end to the intertribal wars, two evils
which cost Africa annually a million
lives. In this work he was promised
the aid of "Gordon Pasha," who had
arranged to take the governorship of
the Lower Congo, under Stanley, who
was to govern the Upper Congo; and,
together, they were to destroy the slave trade
at its roots. General Gordon
wrote a letter to him in which he said
that he should be happy to serve under
him and work according to his ideas.
But the call of the <placeName key="uga" n="mapped"><country type="nation">Sudan</country></placeName> came just at
this time, and the new state was deprived
of the services of one who might
possibly have changed for the better
the whole course of its history.</p>

<p>What is the present condition of that
part of Africa which Stanley, more than
anyone man, has opened to the outside
world? The most graphic idea of
the marvelous change is to be obtained
by comparing a map of this region published
thirty years ago with one of the
present day. In the old one, except on
the coasts, there is little except a great
blank. In the new one the natural features,
mountains, rivers, lakes, are delineated
with greater minuteness and
accuracy than on maps of some parts
of South America, and the blank space
is dotted over with towns and stations.
The political relations of the country
are shown by the coloration, for the
whole of the two million square miles
has been appropriated by the great
powers of Europe, - England, Germany,
France, and Belgium.</p>
