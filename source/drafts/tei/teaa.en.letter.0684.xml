Sierra Leone Africa May 5th/79</p>

<p>To<lb/>
Hon F. W. Seward<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C. </p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to report 
to the Department, that on the 29th of April 
last, Captain T. J. Burgess, master of 
the American Brig "Ann Elizabeth of Boston 
Mass. then in the port; applied to this 
Consulate for protection; stating that 
a portion of his crew were in a state
of mutiny, and had refused to do
any more work, that the Mate had 
been severely cut and mutilated,
&amp; he himself had been struck twice 
with the <sic>windlas</sic> normon, and the 
men had threatened to kill the mate 
if he returned on board of the 
vessel, &amp; that things were in such a 
<catchwords>state</catchwords>

<pb n="358"/>

state, they did not feel safe to have 
these men on board. I immediately 
went on board of said Brig, and 
found matters just as the Capt had
stated. I then applied to the local
authorities for aid: The men were 
arrested and imprisoned.</p>

<p>I subsequently ordered the men to 
this Consulate for investigation, 
and received each man's statement 
upon oath, a <sic>coppy</sic> of which I 
herewith inclose. From what I 
could gather, it seems that the 
man Bennis was under the influence 
of liquor, and the 1st Officer 
had been on a spree over night, 
hence they were not in a state to <unclear extent="one word"/> 
much. The row began between these two 
while the Capt was in the cabin, &amp; 
the rest of the crew below, consequently 
those who came on deck were incline 
to take their own view of the matter 
as it appeared to them. the Capt 
seemed to be parting the two, when 
the news had been passed below 
<catchwords>that</catchwords> 

<pb n="359"/>

time bound for New York, I thought 
it best to send them by her.</p>

<p>I accordingly sent the two men 
James <sic>Carleslile</sic> &amp; Joseph Dolan 
by the said Barque "Liberia" on the 
2nd of May, J. B. Williams master, 
bound for New York: giving the 
Capt a certificate on the Treasury 
Department for sixty Dollars for 
their passage.</p>

<p>I have to state that I did not send 
them in irons, as the Capt of the Barque 
said he did not require it, and 
the men seemed perfectly willing 
to be sent home from trial.</p> 

<p>The other two men Bennis &amp; Relly 
were sent back on board of the Brig 
"Ann Elizabeth" as they shewed less 
signs of hostility, and seemed 
willing to return to duty.</p>

<p>The Brig "Ann Elizabeth" will probably 
leave this port for Boston in a 
fortnight from this date.</p>

Sierra Leone Africa April 29th/79</p>

<p>"Capt T. J. Burgess's Statement</p>

<p>"This morning about 7 'Oclock while 
writing my letters for mail I heard a 
noise on deck, of some kind of row 
or fight, I proceeded to the deck at 
once. I saw Mr Fosdick the first
Officer, and one of the men Jas Bennis 
clenched &amp; rolling about on the deck: 
I took hold of Mr Fosdick and pulled 
him off from the man, &amp; told that, 
that, was quite enough, I did not allow 
any such work, &amp; they must stop it at 
once; while in the act of <sic>seperating</sic> the 
parties, the rest of the crew came aft, 
armed with the windlass normon 
&amp; knives. One of the men named Jas 
Carlisle struck me on the head with the 
the windlass normon, and once on the 
shoulder, &amp; was in the act of doing it 
again, when the normon was taken out 
of his hand by the second officer of 
the ship. As soon as I came to my senses 
from the effects of the blow, I proceeded 
to the cabin, &amp; from thence to the deck 
being nearly blind from the effects of the 
<catchwords>Blow</catchwords> 

<pb n="362"/>

blow I had received. As I proceeded to 
the deck I met the 1st Officer coming 
down bleeding very badly from blows &amp; 
stabs. After I got to the deck I found things 
quiet with the exception, that the men said 
they would do no more work while on board 
the ship. I at once sent the 1st Officer to 
the Doctor for medical attendance.</p>

<p>One of the men Jas Carlisle made 
the remark "If he came back again that 
he would fix him good. I sent the 
men to breakfast. After breakfast I went 
to turn them to their work. They refused to 
work. I then asked them one by one if 
they were willing to work? Their answer 
was "No! and wanted to know what I was 
going to do with them". I told them I had 
nothing to say, &amp; proceeded at once to the 
American Consul for protection."</p>

<p>Statement of O. G. Fosdick 1st Mate</p>

<p>"This morning about 7'Oclock 
while walking on the quarter deck I 
<sic>percieved</sic> signs of intoxication in 
Jas Bennis, one of the sailors. I spoke 
to him and told him to hurry up &amp; 
not be idling around when he replied 
that he was working as fast as he 
intended to, and would work no 
faster. I then advanced toward him 
and he made a rush at me, and 
we both clenched, and fell down on deck. 
While there the Capt ran up and 
ordered us to stop, and tried to part
us. The remainder of the crew then 
rushed out of the hole armed with 
windlass normon, bolts, &amp; knives,
and rushed upon the Capt, struck 
him twice with an iron normon, 
<sic>stabed</sic> me between the eyes, in the 
fore head and in the arm.</p>

<p>I became insensible from loss of blood, 
a few moments of the recovery, was 
sent on shore to the Dr to be attended 
to."</p>

<p>Statement of Jas Bennis.</p>

<p>"This morning I was working on 
the quarter deck of the Annie Elizabeth 
and the chief officer came to me &amp; 
began a growl with me about the 
sail, &amp; said I was getting on <sic>dam</sic>
slow with the sail. Said I no Sir
I am getting on as quick as I can. 
<sic>The</sic> told me he would have none 
of my cheek. I told him I was not 
giving him any of my cheek. 
says he, "shut up you <sic>dam</sic> son 
of a bitch." I told him I was no son
of a Bitch, and he jumped on top 
of me sitting on the sail below. 
he picked up a <unclear>maullin</unclear> spike and struck 
me over the head. I was stupid. after 
I recovered I saw the rest of my shipmates 
taking my part. I was lying on 
the poop deck, and as near as I can 
remember the Capt caught me by the 
throat (and one of the men told me that 
he said to the mate to give it to me.) 
The next place I found myself was in 
the <sic>forecasel</sic>."</p>

<p>Statement of Jos Dolan</p>

<p>"This morning about 7 Oclock 
the Kroo boy sung out that "Scott is 
getting killed". I rushed on to the 
poop, I saw the chief Officer having 
Bennis under &amp; striking him. 
The Capt had him by the throat. 
I took hold of the Capt &amp; said 
knock off. The Capt said give it 
to him. I took the mate off of him. 
The mate said what the hell you 
want, then he put his hand for his 
revolver. I then struck him &amp; knocked 
him down, and kicked him, he ran 
down to the after companion &amp; asked
the Capt for a revolver. I stood
at the companion door waiting for
him, but he did not come up.
The second Officer told me to keep 
quiet. (Six days ago while 
on duty, coming in harbour, the 1st 
Officer <sic>damed</sic> my soul to hell) 
I went forward and said I would do 
no more work while the chief officer 
was on board that vessel. After breakfast
the Capt came forward &amp; told me to <unclear>turn</unclear> too 
I said No."</p>

<p>Statement if Jas Relly</p>

<p>About 7 Oclock this morning I was 
stowing casks between deck on board 
the "Ann Elizabeth" when Joe sung out 
"come up Relly, the Mate &amp; Capt is 
killing Scotty". so I jumped up the 
main hatch, I rushed to <unclear>them</unclear> and 
took the Capt by the shoulder &amp; told 
him to knock off. I hardly had the 
word out of my mouth when Carlisle 
struck the Capt with the normon. 
I jumped back myself, and then the 
Capt jumped down off the poop; then 
they sung out that he had gone for a 
revolver. I then went to the cabin 
door to prevent his shooting any one 
if he did come up. then I saw the mate 
coming up out of the cabin, &amp; I saw 
a white handle revolver, in his pocket 
behind, so I was going to make a <unclear>snap</unclear> 
for it and throw it over board, but 
he turned round &amp; I missed my chance. 
The Capt came forward and told us to stop 
it he wanted no more of the row. We told 
him we were not going to work any more 
he told us to go to breakfast: after breakfast 
he came forward &amp; asked us if were going to 
turn too. but each of us told him No, we would not 
work any more."</p>

<p>Statement of Jas. F. Carlisle</p> 

<p>"This morning I was in Ann Elizabeth's 
hole about 7'Oclock, when I 
heard a sudden cry. "Come up on 
deck, they are killing Scott."</p>

<p>I jumped up the fore hatch &amp; took 
the normon, and as I ran aft I saw 
the Capt have hold of Bennis by the 
throat. I struck the Capt with this 
weapon, but did not get a fair blow 
at him, for if I had, he would have 
been a dead man, which was my 
intention. Then the Capt went down 
in the cabin and the second mate 
took the normon from me. and the 
first mate went down in the after 
companion, and we took the man 
Bennis forward. I came aft again 
and the mate was on the top of the 
house, he used some foul expressions. 
I then took out my knife &amp; attempted 
to stab him, but it broke. I have 
been struck by 1st Officer before &amp; called 
out of my name. Capt then after 
breakfast came forward to the main 
<catchwords>hatch</catchwords>

hatch, I asked the Capt what he was 
going to do, stating at the same time
that I was going to do no more work on
board that ship, and mentioned that 
as long as I had been going to sea 
I had never been trusted as I had 
been the chief officer of that 
ship with continual <unclear>slurs</unclear> and
