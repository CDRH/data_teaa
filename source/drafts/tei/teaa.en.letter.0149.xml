<p>Sir<lb/>
I have the honor to state that I have
forwarded by same mail a monthly
report of Diseases, Cases, and Deaths
to the National Board of Health
for the month of July; only of Europeans
and mullatoes admitted to the
hospital, but the diseases, cases, and 
deaths, occuring in the others different
natives villages around the city of 
Loanda, such as the Cabindas,
Caboundos, and crews, are almost
impossible to be obtained by the
Portuguese govt. consequently more
so by one. </p>

<p>The Bilious or green fever and 
Dysentry are raging at present among
Europeans and Mullatoes, the report
I have sent was obtained from one

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0149.002"/>
<note>25</note>

of the best doctors of this place: Another
peculiar disease of a dysenteric
character and which is at present
causing great havoc among the black
children is called by the natives
"macculot or macaullo", and is very 
quickly fatal if not attended to at 
once, when it can be very easily cured
It commences with diarrhea; the
character of this disease is the 
production in the anal orifice both 
internally and externally of little
ulcers containing small worms or
maggots.--The Native mode of 
treatment although very cruel
is quickly efficacious and cause it
in plugging the orfice with a wad
of crushed "filia and "Herva Santa
Maria", dipped in strong solutions
of Rum, lime juice powdered gun
powder and Cayene pepper.</p>

<p>This disease I was told is due 
to overcrowding quarters, want
of cleanliness and improper
foods; But change of places

will also produce it, as it can be seen
by the boys and girls captured or
stolen in the interior and sold 
daily for a pretended 3 to 5 years,
servitudes which last forever.</p>
