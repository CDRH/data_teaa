<p>Consulate General of the United States,<lb/>
Monrovia, La, April 27, 1881.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>An annual report for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1880, such as the consular regulations require– cannot be furnished for the fiscal year just ended that would contain any new facts; and aside from the few statistics contained, as to our own trade with the Republic, would be substantially in its details as the preceding annual report. Please find one enclosure marked #1, 'return of Liberian <catchwords>trade</catchwords>

trade with the United States'.</p>

<p>There is an impression spreading and happily influencing the common people, that the hope for bread, for comfort, for respectable manhood, is in the soil.</p>

<p>The financial condition of the country is bad, and is destined to grow worse rather than better until public morality shall be vitalized, until <catchwords>official</catchwords>

official delinquency can be punished, and is punished by the courts, and by public censure.</p>

<p>The inability of the poor to support themselves as common laborers and servants to the better class, on account of the irredeemable currency which is used as money; each year sends some to the soil, and as "the uses of adversity are sweet", it may be that this severe school of financial adversity is the means to make the country what nature destined it to be– by cultivation– a rich agricultural region.</p>

<p>The increase of coffee is in like proportion to the quantity <catchwords>reported</catchwords>

reported last year; perhaps a little in excess of last year. Camwood has not appreciably decreased in quantity nor quality.</p>
