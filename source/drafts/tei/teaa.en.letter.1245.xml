Indigent American
children in Liberia</p>

<p>No. 4, Consular Series
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia;
Sept. 19, 1898.</p>

<p>Hon. John B. Moore,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Wasington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to call
your attention to the lamentable
fact, that in the year
189- one J. C. Todd, wife
and five children of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, moved to
this country. I am told,
that in a very short time,
possibly, not exceding 30
days, after their arrival, both
the father and the mother
sickened and died; leaving
five small children, in a
strange country, unknown,
friendless, pennyless and
helpless. It was learned</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2174.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>prior to the death of the
father - J. C. Todd, that he
was a <unclear>Masau</unclear>; whereupon,
the fraternity, here, made
some effort, to temporarily,
provide for the relief
of the suffering children.
Having no Orphanage,
<unclear>also</unclear> house, nor charitable
institution here, the children
were brought before the Court, where a guardian
was appointed to
look after them. They were
separated and placed in
such families as would
take them. One of them
has since died; leaving
four, the oldest of whom is
a boy, I am told of 12 or
13 years. He, I am told,
is with an old lady, in
the country, very badly and
poorly provided for, being
very scantily fed, and almost
entirely</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2175.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>entirely without clothing;
and for these and other
cruelties, he has recently,
twice run away from her,
and has endeavored to
make his way to a Colony
of Americans, more
recently in this country;
but in each effort to
escape he has been
overtaken and returned to
this cruel and merciless
house. We have a letter
from William R. Morris
Esq. Atty at Law, No. 927
<unclear>Grearauty</unclear> Loan Building
Minneappolis, who says
that if it was possible to
get the children back to
Minneappolis, that the
friends of the deceased
father and mother would
take the children, rear and
educate them.</p>

<p>While I know of no
provission</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2176.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>Provission of law, whereby
I can render the children
the necessary and proper
relief, yet, for the sake of
innocent infant, suffering
humanity, I appeal to the
State Department, for
permission or authority to
send these little suffers
back to America.</p>

<p>By authority of the State
Department, I can very
easily arrange a safe
transit for them, with
Messrs Elder, Dempstir &amp; Co.,
of Liverpool, whose ships
touches here, every two weeks.
They are also the Liverpool
Agents of the "White Star
Line," between Liverpool
and New York.</p>

<p>Upon reaching New
York, the children could
be delivered to the Chief of
Police, who doubtless,
having</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2177.jpg"/>

<p>7</p>

<p>having been previously advised,
by the Department, could and
would take pleasure, in
arranging their transportation
and sending them off
for Minneappolis.</p>

<p>Anxiously awaiting
your pleasure and
advice.</p>

<p>I have the honor
to be your obedient
servant;
Owen L. W. Smith
United States,
Consul General
Monrovia Liberia.</p>
