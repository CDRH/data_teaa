<p>Who, furnished with full powers which have been found in good and
due form, have successively discussed and adopted:</p>

<p>1st. A Declaration relative to the liberty of commerce in the basin of the Congo, embouchures and neighboring countries, with certain dispositions connected therewith;</p>

<p>2nd. A Declaration concerning the slave trade and the operations which on land or sea furnish slaves for the trade;</p>
   
<p>3rd. A Declaration relative to the neutrality of the territory comprised in the conventional basin of the Congo;</p>

<p>4th. An Act of navigation of the Congo, which while taking note of local circumstances, extends to this river, to its affluents and to the Waters which are assimilated to them, the general principles announced in Articles 108 to 116 of the final Act of the Congress of Vienna and designed to regulate between the Powers signatory to said Act, the free navigation of navigable water courses which separate or traverse several States, principles since then conventionally applied to certain rivers of Europe and of America, and notably to the Danube, with the modifications provided by the treaties of Paris of 1856, of Berlin of 1878, and of London of 1871 and of 1883;</p>

<p>5th. An Act of navigation of the Niger which, While equally taking
note of local circumstances, extends to this river and to its affluents the
same principles inscribed in Articles 108 to 116 of the final Act of the
Congress of Vienna;</p>

<p>6th. A Declaration introducing into international relations certain
uniform rules relative to the occupations which may take place in the
future upon the coasts of the African Continent;</p>

<p>And having judged that these different documents might be usefully
coordinated in a single instrument, have collected them into a general
Act composed of the following articles.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter">

<head type="main">Chapter I.</head>
<head type="sub">Declaration Relative to the Liberty of Commerce in the Basin
of the Congo, its Embouchures and Neighboring Country, and
Dispositions Connected Therewith.</head>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 1.</head>

<p>The commerce of all nations shall enjoy complete liberty:</p>

<p>1st. In all the territories constituting the <placeName n="mapped"><geogName type="basin" key="bas.con">basin of the Congo</geogName></placeName> and its affluents. This basin is defined by the crests of the contiguous basins, to wit: notably the basins of the Niari, of the Ogove, of the Schari and of the Nile, on the North; by the line of Eastern water shed of the affluents of lake Tanganyka on the East; by the crests of the basins of the Zambeze and of the Loge, on the South. It embraces, consequently, all the territories drained by the Congo and its affluents, including the lake Tanganyka and its Eastern tributaries.</p>

<p>2nd. In the maritime zone extending along the Atlantic ocean from
the parallel of 2&#176; 30&#146; Southern latitude to the mouth of the Loge.</p>

<p>The Northern boundary shall follow the parallel of 2&#176; 30&#146; from the
coast to the point where it strikes the geographical basin of the Congo,
avoiding the basin of the Ogove to which the stipulations of the present
Act do not apply.</p>

<p>The Southern boundary shall follow the course of the Loge up to the source of this river and shall be directed thence Eastward to the junction of the geographical basin of the Congo.</p>

<p>3rd. In the zone prolonged to the East of the Congo basin as it is above described, as far as the Indian ocean, from the fifth degree of North latitude to the mouth of the Zambeze on the South; from this point the line of demarcation shall follow the Zambeze to a point five miles above the confluence of the Shire and shall continue by the line of water shed separating the waters which flow towards the lake Nyassa from the waters tributary to the Zambeze to rejoin finally the line dividing the waters of the Zambeze and of the Congo.</p>

<p>It is expressly understood that in extending to this Eastern zone the
principle of commercial liberty the Powers represented at the Conference only engage for themselves and that this principle shall apply to territories actually belonging to any independent and sovereign State only
in so far as it shall give its consent thereto. The Powers agree to employ their good offices with the governments established upon the African
littoral of the Indian ocean in order to obtain such consent and, in
every case, to assure to the transit of all nations the most favorable conditions.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 2.</head>

<p>All flags, without distinction of nationality, shall have free access to
all the littoral of the territories above enumerated, to the rivers which
there empty into the sea, to all the waters of the Congo and its affluents
including the lakes, to all the ports situated upon the borders of these
waters, as well as to all the canals which may in the future be excavated
with the object of connecting together the water courses or lakes comprised in the whole extent of the territories described in Article 1. They
may undertake every kind of transport and exercise the coastwise navigation by sea and river as also small boat transportation upon the same
footing as the allegiants.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 3.</head>
   
<p>Merchandise of every origin imported into these territories, under
whatever flag it may be, by route of sea or river or land, shall have to
discharge no other taxes than those which may be collected as an equitable compensation for expenses useful to commerce and which, under
this head, must be equally borne by the allegiants and by strangers of
every nationality.</p>

<p>All differential treatment is prohibited in respect to ships as well as
merchandise.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 4.</head>

<p>Merchandise imported into these territories shall remain free from
entrance and transit dues.</p>

<p>The Powers reserve to themselves to decide, at the end of a period
of twenty years, whether freedom of entry shall or shall not be maintained.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 5.</head>

<p>Every Power which exercises or shall exercise rights of sovereignty
in the territories under consideration shall not concede there either
monopoly or privilege of any kind in commercial matters.</p>

<p>Strangers shall enjoy there without distinction, for the protection of
their persons and their goods, the acquisition and transmission of their
movable and immovable property and for the exercise of the professions,
the same treatment and the same rights as the allegiants.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 6.</head>

<p>Depositions relative to the protection of the natives, of missionaries and
of travelers, and also to religious liberty.</p>

   <p>All Powers exercising rights of sovereignty or an influence in the
Said territories engage themselves to watch over the conservation of
the indigenous populations and the amelioration of their moral and
material conditions of existence and to strive for the suppression of
slavery and especially of the negro slave trade; they shall protect and
favor without distinction of nationality or of worship, all the institutions
and enterprises religious, scientific or charitable, created and organized
for these objects or tending to instruct the natives and to make them
understand and appreciate the advantages of civilization.</p>

<p>The christian missionaries, the savants, the explorers, their escorts,
properties and collections shall be equally the object of special protection.</p>

<p>Liberty of conscience and religious toleration are expressly guaranteed
to the natives as well as to allegiants and to strangers.</p>

<p>The free and public exercise of all forms of worship, the right to erect
religious edifices and to organize missions belonging to all forms of
worship shall not be subjected to any restriction or hindrance.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 7.</head>

<head type="sub-sub">Postal regime.</head>

<p>The Convention of the universal postal Union revised at Paris June 1st. 1878 shall be applied to the conventional basis of the Congo.</p>

<p>The Powers who there exercise or shall exercise rights of sovereignty
or of protectorate engage themselves to take, so soon as circumstances
shall permit it, measures necessary for the execution of the preceding
disposition.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 8.</head>

<head type="sub-sub">Right of supervision attributed to the international commission of navigation of the Congo.</head>

<p>In all parts of the territory within the purview of the present Declaration where no Power may exercise rights of sovereignty or of protectorate, the International Commission of navigation of the Congo, instituted by virtue of Article 17, shall be charged to supervise the application of the principles proclaimed and established by this Declaration.</p>

<p>In all cases where difficulties relative to the application of the principles established by the present Declaration may happen to arise, the
governments interested may agree to appeal to the good offices of the
International Commission by deferring to it the examination of the facts
which shall have given occasion to those difficulties.</p>

</div3>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter">

<head type="main">Chapter II.</head>
<head type="sub">Declaration Concerning the Slave Trade.</head>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 9.</head>

<p>Conformably to the principles of the law of nations, as they are recognized by the signatory Powers, the slave trade being interdicted, and
as the operations which, by land or sea, furnish slaves to the trade ought
to be equally considered as interdicted, the Powers who exercise or shall
exercise rights of sovereignty or an influence in the territories forming
the conventional basin of the Congo declare that these territories shall
not serve either for a market or way of transit for the trade in slaves of
any race whatever. Each of these Powers engages itself to employ all
the means in its power to put an end to this commerce and to punish
those who are occupied in it.</p>

</div3>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter">

<head type="main">Chapter III.</head>
<head type="sub">Declaration Relative to the Neutrality of the Territories Comprised in the Conventional Basin of the Congo.</head>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 10.</head>

<p>In order to give a new guarantee of security to commerce and to
industry and to favor, by the maintenance of peace, the development of
civilization in the countries mentioned in Article 1 and placed under
the regime of commercial liberty, the high signatory parties of the present
Act and those who shall subsequently adhere to it engage themselves
to respect the neutrality of the territories or parts of territories depending on said countries, including therein the territorial waters, so long as
the Powers who exercise or shall exercise rights of sovereignty or protectorate over these territories, making use of the option to proclaim
themselves neutrals, shall fulfill the duties which belong to neutrality.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 11.</head>

<p>In the case Where a Power exercising rights of sovereignty or of protectorate in the countries mentioned in Article 1 and placed under the
regime of commercial liberty may be involved in a war, the high signatory parties of the Present Act and those who shall adhere to it subsequently engage themselves to lend their good offices to the end that the
territories belonging to this Power and comprised in the conventional
zone of commercial liberty may be, with the common consent of this
Power and of the other party or parties belligerent, placed for the duration of the war under the regime of neutrality and considered as belonging to a non-belligerent State; the belligerent parties may renounce,
thenceforth, the extension of hostilities to the territories thus neutralised,
as also their use as a base for the operations of war.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 12.</head>

<p>In case a serious dissension, springing up on the subject or Within
the limits of the territories mentioned in Article 1 and placed under
the regime of commercial liberty should happen to arise between the
signatory Powers of the present Act or the Powers which may subsequently adhere to it, these Powers engage themselves, before appealing
to arms, to have recourse to the mediation of one or more friendly
Powers.</p>

<p>In the same case the same powers reserve to themselves the optional
recourse to the procedure of arbitration.</p>

</div3>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter">

<head type="main">Chapter IV.</head>
<head type="sub">Act of Navigation of the <placeName n="mapped"><geogName type="river" key="riv.con">Congo</geogName></placeName>.</head>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 13.</head>

<p>The navigation of the Congo, without exception of any of the branches
or issues of this river, is and shall remain entirely free for merchant
vessels, loaded or in ballast, of all nations, as well for the transport of
merchandise as for that of travelers. It must conform itself to the
dispositions of the present navigation Act and to the regulations to be
established in the execution of the same Act.</p>

<p>In the exercise of this navigation the subjects and the flags of all the
nations shall be treated, in all respects, upon the footing of a perfect
equality, as well for the direct navigation from the open sea toward the
interior ports of the Congo, and vice versa, as for the great and small
coastwise navigation and also for the small-boat transportation throughout the extent of this river.</p>

<p>Consequently, throughout the extent and at the mouths of the Congo,
no distinction shall be made between the subjects of riparian and nonriparian States, and no exclusive privilege of navigation shall be conceded, either to societies or corporations of any kind or to private persons.</p>

<p>These dispositions are recognized by the signatory powers as forming
henceforth a part of public international law.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 14.</head>

<p>The navigation of the Congo cannot be subjected to any hindrance or
charge which may not be expressly stipulated in the present Act. It
shall not be burdened with any obligation of scaled voyages, ports of
stoppage, of depot, of breaking bulk, or of compulsory interruption.</p>

<p>In all the extent of the Congo, ships and merchandise passing along
the river shall not be subjected to any transit dues, whatever may be
their origin or their destination.</p>

<p>There shall not be established any maritime or river transit tax based
upon the simple fact of navigation, nor any dues upon the merchandise
which is found on board the ships. Only taxes or dues can be collected
which shall have the character of compensation for services rendered to
navigation itself, namely:</p>


<list type="simple">
<item>1st. Port taxes for the actual use of certain local establishments
such as quays, storehouses, etc. etc.</item>
<item>The tariff of these taxes shall be calculated upon the expenses of
construction and maintenance of said local establishments, and its
application shall be made without regard to the origin of ships or
to their cargo.</item>
<item>2nd. Certain dues of pilotage upon the sections of the river where
it may appear necessary to create stations of commissioned pilots.</item>
<item>The tariff of these dues shall be fixed and proportioned to the
service rendered.</item>
<item>3rd. Certain dues designed to cover the technical and administrative expenses, made in the general interest of navigation, including therein dues for lighthouses, lights and buoys.</item>
<item>Dues of this last category shall be based upon the tonnage of
vessels, as it appears from the papers on board, and conformably
to the rules adopted upon the lower Danube.</item>
</list>


<p>The tariffs according to which the taxes and dues, enumerated in the
three preceding paragraphs, shall be collected, shall carry with them
no differential treatment and must be officially published in each port.</p>

<p>The Powers reserve to themselves to examine, at the end of a period
of five years, whether there is occasion to revise, by common accord, the
tariffs above mentioned.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 15.</head>

<p>The affluents of the Congo shall in all respects be submitted to the
same regime as the river of which they are tributaries.</p>

<p>The same regime shall be applied to the rivers and streams as also
to the lakes and canals of the territories defined by Article 1, paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>

<p>The attributions of the International Commission of the Congo however shall not extend over the said rivers, streams, lakes and canals,
except with the assent of the States under the sovereignty of which
they are placed. It is well understood also that for the territories mentioned in Article 1, paragraph 3, the consent of the sovereign States on
which these territories depend, remain reserved.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 16.</head>

<p>The routes, railroads or lateral canals which may be established for
the special object of supplementing the innavigability of imperfections
of the river way over certain sections of the course of the Congo, of its
affluents and of the other water courses which are assimilated to them
by Article 15 shall be considered, in their quality of means of communication, as dependencies of this river and shall be equally open to the
traffic of all nations.</p>

<p>In like manner as upon the river, upon these routes, railroads and
canals transit taxes can only be collected which are calculated upon
the expenses of construction, of maintenance and of administration, and
upon the profits due to the constructors.</p>

<p>As to the rates of these transit taxes strangers and allegiants of the
respective territories shall be treated upon the footing of perfect equality.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 17.</head>

<p>There is instituted an International Commission charged to assure
the execution of the dispositions of the present navigation Act.</p>

<p>The signatory Powers of this Act, as well as those who shall adhere
to it hereafter, can, at all times, have themselves represented in the said
Commission, each by one delegate. No delegate can dispose of more
than one vote even in the case where he may represent several governments.</p>

<p>This delegate shall be directly compensated by his government.</p>

<p>The pay and allowances of the agents and employ&#233;s of the International Commission shall be charged upon the product of the dues collected conformably to Article 14, paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>

<p>The figures of the said pay and allowances as well as the number, the
grade and the attributions of the agents and employ&#233;s, shall be inscribed
in the report which shall be addressed each year to the governments
represented in the International Commission.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 18.</head>

<p>The members of the International Commission as well as the agents
named by it, are invested with the privilege of inviolability in the exercise of their functions. The same guarantee shall extend to the offices,
bureaus and archives of the Commission.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 19.</head>

<p>The International Commission of navigation of the Congo shall constitute itself so soon as five of the signatory Powers of the present
general Act shall have named their delegates. While awaiting the constitution of the Commission, the nomination of the delegates shall be
notified to the Government of the German Empire, by whose care the
necessary steps shall be taken to provoke the assemblage of the Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission shall immediately elaborate regulations of navigation,
of river police, of pilotage and of quarantine.</p>

<p>These regulations, as well as the tariffs to be established by the Com-
mission, before being put in force, shall be submitted to the approbation
of the Powers represented in the Commission. The Powers interested
shall make known their opinion with the least delay possible.</p>

<p>Infractions of these regulations shall be repressed by the agents of the
International Commission, where it shall exercise direct its authority,
and elsewhere by the riparian Power.</p>

<p>In case of an abuse of power or of an injustice on the part of an agent
or employ&#233; of the International Commission, the individual who shall
regard himself as injured in his person or in his rights may address
himself to the consular agent of his nation. The latter shall examine
the complaint; if he finds it prima facie reasonable, he shall have the
right to present it to the Commission. Upon his initiative, the Commission represented by at least three of its members, shall join itself to him
to make an investigation touching the conduct of its agent or employ&#233;. If
the consular agent considers the decision of the Commission as giving
rise to objections of right, he shall make a report of it to his government
which may have recourse to the Powers represented in the Commission
and invite them to come to agreement upon the instructions to be given
to the Commission.</p>

<head type="sub">Act of the Navigation of the Niger.</head>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 26.</head>

<p>The navigation of the <placeName n="mapped"><geogName type="river" key="riv.nig">Niger</geogName></placeName>, without exception of any of the branches
or issues of this river, is and shall remain entirely free for the merchant
ships, laden or in ballast, of all nations, as well for the transport of
merchandise as for that of travelers. It must conform to the dispositions of the present navigation Act and to the regulations to be established in execution of the same Act.</p>

<p>In the exercise of this navigation, the subjects and the flags of all
nations, shall be treated, in all respects, upon the footing of a perfect
equality, as well for the direct navigation from the open sea toward
the interior ports of the Niger, and vice versa, as for the great and small
coastwise navigation, and also for the small boat transportation throughout the extent of this river.</p>

<p>Consequently, upon all the extent and at the mouths of the Niger,
there shall be no distinction made between the subjects of the riparian
and non-riparian States, and no exclusive privilege of navigation shall
be conceded, either to societies or corporations of any kind, or to private
persons.</p>

<p>These dispositions are recognized by the signatory Powers as forming
henceforth part of international public law.</p>

charge based solely upon the fact of navigation.</p>

<p>It shall not be subjected to any obligation of scaled voyages, ports
of stoppage, of depot, of breaking bulk, or compulsory interruption.</p>

<p>Upon all the extent of the Niger, vessels and merchandise passing
upon the river shall not be subjected to any transit dues, whatever may
be their origin or their destination.</p>

<p>There shall not be established any maritime or river transit tax,
based upon the simple fact of navigation, nor any duty upon the merchandise which is found on board the vessels. There can be collected
only the tax or duty which shall have the character of compensation
for service rendered to navigation itself. The tariffs of these taxes or
duties shall carry with them no differential treatment.</p>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article 28.</head>

<p>The routes, railroads or lateral canals which may be established with
the special object of supplementing the innavigability or imperfections
of the river Way upon certain sections of the course of the Niger, of its
affluents, branches and issues shall be considered, in their quality of
means of communication, as dependencies of this river and shall be
equally open to the traffic of all nations.</p>

<p>In like manner as upon the river, there shall be collected upon these
routes, railroads and canals, only transit taxes calculated upon the
expenses of construction, of maintenance and of administration, and
upon the profits due to the constructors.</p>

<p>As to the rates of these transit taxes, strangers and allegiants of
the respective territories shall be treated upon the footing of perfect
equality.</p>

<p>Great Britain engages itself to apply the principles of the liberty of navigation announced in Articles 26, 27, 28, 29, in so far as the waters of the Niger, of its affluents, branches and issues, are or shall be under
its sovereignty or protectorate.</p>

<p>The regulations which it shall establish for the safety and control of
navigation shall be conceived in a manner to facilitate so far as possible
the circulation of merchant vessels.</p>

<p>It is understood that nothing in the engagements thus taken can be
interpreted as preventing or able to prevent Great Britain from making
such regulations of navigation whatever they may be, as may not be
contrary to the spirit of these engagements.</p>

<p>Great Britain engages itself to protect the foreign traders of all
nations carrying on commerce in the portions of the course of the Niger
