<p>Antananarive
20 May 1884:

Sir,
In the present state of political
affairs in Her Majesty's Dominions 
of Madagascar, I desire to communi
cate with you on questions that concern
most vitally the threatened integrity of 
this Dominion, as well as the interests
of the United States, which under Our
recent Treaty of amity and commerce
with your Government, are hazarded
by the present attitude of affairs.</p>

<p>In communications addressed to 
His Excellency the President, by Her
Majesty Ranavalona III, and by 
myself, there has been set forth the 
needs and necessities of this Govern-
ement, and the requests for the advice

and</p>

<p>To,
The Honorable
Fredrick T. Frelinghuysen
Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155043"/>

<p>and assistance of the United States in
this time of Our national troubles.</p>

<p>In this communication it is my 
wish to call briefly to your attention the 
plain causes that have inaugurated our 
present difficulties, the effect this position 
has upon commercial relations of the 
United States, the recent Treaty rights
endangered, and other questions of 
great importance to the Government
of the United States, and that of Her 
Majesty.</p>

<p>Our present isolation from the 
World's affairs has taught us its lesson
in that lack of sympathy, or interest,
which the cause of an infant nation
just emerging into the light of civili-
zation should justly excite among
its older and more advanced neigh-
bors. The great mass of Her Majesty'
-s subjects are still untaught in the 
way of diplomacy, and are ignorant
of the results of political entanglement
and intrigue. It is impossible for 
them to understand, who are still
young to the benefits of a religion, 

and</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155051"/>

<p>and a progress so antagonistic to the 
teachings of their ancestors, the justice
of any cause which should excite the 
hostility of a power grows old in such
a civilization. The leaders of Reform in
Madagascar, the believers in progress,
had no easy task before them, even
if our present difficulties had not 
complicated the opposition of their 
antagonists.</p>

<p>What more disheartining picture
to the firm believers in the destiny of 
our race could be presented that, that of 
Her Majesty's Dominions whose laws
have been violated, whose flag has been 
fried upon, and whose just appeals have
been unlistened to by those nations whose 
civilizations we wish to learn from.</p>

<p>I desire to refer briefly and plainly
to those causes, that have placed Her
Majety's Domimions in this present
difficult position.</p>

<p>Madagascar was first visited by the Portuguese in 1506 who had for
some time, a small settlement in the 

Island</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155102"/>
<p>Island. In 1595 and 1598 a number
of Dutch Colonists settled ar Antagonist
Bay on the East Coast. In 1643 the
French made their first, settlement a 
St. Lucia and Fort Dauphin, but 
previous to this, the English had formed
a colony on the South West Coast. The 
French abandoned their settlement
in 1672, and not until 1745 did they
establish themselves at St. Mary, a 
small Island on the East Coast and
at Foule Point on the same coast. In
1876 the French withdrew entirely from 
the mainland of Madagascar. In
1810 the English captured the Islands
of Mauritius and Bourbon and their 
dependencies, and on the 25th of May,
1816, the governor of Mauritius took
formal possession of Madagascar
in the name of the British Crown.
In 1817 all rights possessed by Great
Britain were ceded to Radama)
with whom they made a Treaty of 
Friendship and commerce, and en-
sured tthe addition of the export slave-

trade</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155119"/>
<p>trade. Radama I. conquered the 
Takalava of His reign there was not 
a single tribe in Madagascar that
had not submitted to His power. Such
is a brief history of the French connec-
tion with Madagascar up to the date 
of 1817.</p>

<p>These difficulties can be generally 
divided into three heads. I The Laborde
difficulty; II The Dhou" Trade" affair; III.
The claims to the protectorate by France
on the Northwest portion of Her
Majesty's dominions. Out of these
three have given all the recent com-
plications, and the present threatened
absorption or dismembermen of Ma-
dagascar.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to call to your 
attention before taking up the discu-
ssion of the first of thse causes that
it is a law of this country that no 
land can be actually sold to forei-
gners of any nationality; but they are
permitted by treaty to lease, or sent
lands, houses, or storehouses any length 

of</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155138"/>

<p>of time not exceeding twenty five years +,
(vide Treaty of Peace Friendship and Com-
merce between America and Madagascar
Article III, section I and article V amending
Treaty with Great Britain of the 27th.
June 1865 and with other Powers).</p>

<p>I. The Mr. Laborde difficulty. In 1835, a
certain Mr. Laborde, a shipwrecked French 
Sailor, was brought to this Capitol, and
in order to gain his liberty agreed to
teach the people certain arts with which
he was will acquainted. By his efforts
he gradually gained much influence +
and popularity with the Government +
and people, and was, by the former given
as a reward for life, three pieces of property--
one in the vicinity of the capital; <uclear/> he
country at Mantasoa, where he established
an iron foundry for the manufacture
of guns, tc; and the third, the residence
in the capital, afterwards used by him,
in his appointment as Consul for 
France, as the French Consulate. Mr.
Laborde became a Malagasy citizen
then. He died in 1878, leaving as his
heir a certain Mr. Campan, his nephew,

and</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155154"/>

<p>and who had occupied the post of Chancellor
and Secretary of the Consulate. Mr. Laborde
was succeeded, in 1880, by Mr. Cassas as
French Consul, Mr. Campan claims, not 
only the houses, but the land upon which 
they stand. The houses we consider by 
Law to belong to the legatee; the right to the
land we deny, as already stated, no land
can belong to a foreign in feesimple.
Mr. Meyer, in whose turn of office
occurred the Dhou "Toale" affair to which 
I shall refer succeeded Mr. Cassas
in 1884, and was in turn succeeded
by Mr. Baudais.</p>

<p>II. The Dhow. "Toale" Diffculty. A short
distance down the coast from Remba-
toka Bay, west coast of Madagascar
are four Sakalava chiefs which were
at this time at war with each other.
Of these, Baby, Joalala and Boina had
made an attack upon Marambitsy.
A Dhow the "Toale" from Mayotta one
of the common Island seized by the
French, conveyed arms and ammunition
under the French flag to these Mearam-
bitsy people, but was discovered by a 

party</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155203"/>

<p>party landing her cargo. A fight naturally
ensued and several of the Arabs were
killed, as also several subjects of Mad-
agascar. For this so called outrage
we have been forced to pay an indemnity
to the French of 9.740 dollars. Though
this affair shpwed clearly that the
local chiefs were loyal to the Hova
Government, and that the French 
recognized the Hova control over
the very district they are now claim-
ing.</p>
    
<p>III. The claims by France over the North
West territory. The entire claims made
by France over the Northwestern portion
of Her Majesty's Dominions (extending
from the parallel upwards) rests upon
a treaty they alleged to be made by
them with a certain Tsimiharo, chief
of Antakarama who being defeated
by the Hova troops in the time of 
Radama I. took refuge in the 
Island of Nosibe, and called in
the French to protect him. For some 
years the French did so but they at
length carried Tsisnichare and his 

brother</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_155220"/>  
    
<p>brother to Reunion with the threat
that unless he so accompanied them
and made a treaty in their behalf
they would leave him to his fate.
Tsinihare wished to consult with 
his subjects in the mainland, but this 
was refused. On arrival in Reunion
he mae a treaty ceding Nosibe to 
the French in condition of enjoying
the protection of the French and recei-
ving $20 a montth. When Tsinihare
returned to his own land and told his
subjects, they were indignant but it
was too late. On these grounds the French
now claim protectorate over the North 
west territory of Her Majesty's
Dominions. From 1841, thus Nosibe
has remained in the hands of the 
French, but from that date unti 1882
no attempt has ever been made to enforce
to so called claim of the French to 
the mainland, and Her Majesty's
Government has always strenuously
resiste any and all such claims by 
foreigners at possession and righteously,
and firmly deny the right of any 

rebellions</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_155229"/>    
    
<p>rebellions tribe to alienate any part
of Her Majesty's Dominions to a 
foreign Power. In 1868 a Treaty of
Friendship and Commmerce was made
with France, wherein no reference was
made to any such alleged French claims,
either on the east or west coasts of Mada-
gascar; in it; further the Sovereign was
styled Queen of Madagascar and for 
many years the custom dues were re-
gularly paid by French vessels as 
well as those of the other nahoirs to 
Her Majesty's Custom house officers
in the north west territory, now claimed
by the French. In 1862 a French
Company commonly known as the 
"Lambert Company" succeeded in "indu-"
cing the Young King Radama II to 
sign a charter by which enoromous
concession were made, giving the 
French rights to occupy rivers, ports,
forests, mines, etc actually giving to 
them everything worth having in 
Madagascar. This agreement was
bitterly opposed by the leading minds
in Madagascar and its concession

was</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155244"/>

<p>was one of the leading causes of the revo-
lution that deprived Radama II his 
crown and his life.</p>

<p>This charter was promptly repudiated
by his successor and after much difficu-
lty the French Company abandoned its
claims on the payment by the Malagady
of 1,200,000 francs. In both documents
Radama II was styled "King of Ma-
dagascar". There can be no doubt that
the French Trading Company has not
a little to do with the revival of French 
claim in Madagascar.</p>

<p>American and English trade
is by far the largest in the Island, and 
vigorous attacks are made upon it by 
the French.</p>
    
<p>The results that have so rapidly
followed the lawful attempts on the 
part of Her Majesty to establish her
just DOminions over the whole Island,
the planting of the Malagasy flags
presented to the Takalava Embassy
on their territory of the north west, and 
their hauling down by the commander
of the French frigate "Porfait"; the 

embargo</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155306"/>

<p>embargo of the Malagasy vessel 
"Antananarivo" due to the same cause,
the detention in the departure of Her
Majesty's Ambassadors to Europe 
and the United States, and the 
bombardment of our principal sea-
ports; the laying waste of our coasts,
and the precipitation of all the horrors
of war on a once peaceful and happy 
people, all these are already known 
to you.</p>

<p>I desire to call, Mr. Secretary
your attention to the direct reflection
and disastrous results to the commerce
and influence of the United States 
in these distant seas by the action 
of the French Republic.</p>

<p>The commerce with Madagascar
in American manufactures upwards
of $3,000,000 a year. In cotton goods, 
cutlery and in all the misellancous 
articles of household use. American  
goods stand in the unquestioned
first place. This commerce has grown
from about $400,000 in 1879, to its
present proportion and will certainly

develop</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155314"/>

<p>develope to about ten times its volume
in a brief period, if we are enabled
to carry out our wishes and our pledges
to your Government.</p>

<p>Of all the vast number of articles
manufactured in America there is 
scarcely one that would not be eagerly
purchased here if seen, once brought
to the notice of our people, the earnest
and it is now known throughout
our land that in the products of the 
soils lies a ready means of exchange.
Habits of industry are thus encouraged
and each forward step of commerce
creates wants, fosters thrift, and educates
our people by contact with civilization 
and points to vast commercial relations 
between our Governments that are
full of promise.</p>

<p>T our great regret and to the 
great loss to your citizens who are
engaged in trade here, the present
difficulty with a foreign Power has 
come upon us in spite of our most
strenuous efforts to avoid it. This trouble

is</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155330"/>
<p>is most damaging to your countrymen
here; threatens the dismemberment of
our country and prevents our Govern-
men t from extending that assistance 
towards developing the dormant resources
of our kingdom which it is our
earnest wish to afford to your energito
countrymen. Thus have I attempted
to place before you the plain facts
in the present crtical condition of 
Her Majesty's Dominions in 
Madagascar, the threatened des-
truction of yhear commercial relations
and the impossibilty of Her Majesty
carrying out, as the desires, the en-
lightened and liberal Treaty recently
contracted with the Government
of the United States.</p>
    
<p>Practically can the United States
look with indifference upon the loss
of this stronghold of trade in the East 
or can, She as the exponenet of progress
and enlightenment fail to sympathize
as her great friend and example.
Her Majesty and myself in a 

contrary</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155337"/>
<p>contrary hope have thus appealed to 
your Government to justly settle
our difficulties, and arrange these
differences.</p>   
    
<p>I call to your attention the 
enclosed printed copies of correspondance
and reports on the negotiations be-
tween the French Representations in 
Madagascar, and Our Authorities.

May God bless you, Sir,
Faith your friend
(signed) Rainibaiarivony

Prime Minister</p>
