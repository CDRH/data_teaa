<p>Antananarive
20 May 1884:

Sir,
In the present state of political
affairs in Her Majesty's Dominions 
of Madagascar, I desire to communi
cate with you on questions that concern
most vitally the threatened integrity of 
this Dominion, as well as the interests
of the United States, which under Our
recent Treaty of amity and commerce
with your Government, are hazarded
by the present attitude of affairs.</p>

<p>In communications addressed to 
His Excellency the President, by Her
Majesty Ranavalona III, and by 
myself, there has been set forth the 
needs and necessities of this Govern-
ement, and the requests for the advice

and</p>

<p>To,
The Honorable
Fredrick T. Frelinghuysen
Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155043"/>

<p>and assistance of the United States in
this time of Our national troubles.</p>

<p>In this communication it is my 
wish to call briefly to your attention the 
plain causes that have inaugurated our 
present difficulties, the effect this position 
has upon commercial relations of the 
United States, the recent Treaty rights
endangered, and other questions of 
great importance to the Government
of the United States, and that of Her 
Majesty.</p>

<p>Our present isolation from the 
World's affairs has taught us its lesson
in that lack of sympathy, or interest,
which the cause of an infant nation
just emerging into the light of civili-
zation should justly excite among
its older and more advanced neigh-
bors. The great mass of Her Majesty'
-s subjects are still untaught in the 
way of diplomacy, and are ignorant
of the results of political entanglement
and intrigue. It is impossible for 
them to understand, who are still
young to the benefits of a religion, 

and</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155051"/>

<p>and a progress so antagonistic to the 
teachings of their ancestors, the justice
of any cause which should excite the 
hostility of a power grows old in such
a civilization. The leaders of Reform in
Madagascar, the believers in progress,
had no easy task before them, even
if our present difficulties had not 
complicated the opposition of their 
antagonists.</p>

<p>What more disheartining picture
to the firm believers in the destiny of 
our race could be presented that, that of 
Her Majesty's Dominions whose laws
have been violated, whose flag has been 
fried upon, and whose just appeals have
been unlistened to by those nations whose 
civilizations we wish to learn from.</p>

<p>I desire to refer briefly and plainly
to those causes, that have placed Her
Majety's Domimions in this present
difficult position.</p>

<p>Madagascar was first visited by the Portuguese in 1506 who had for
some time, a small settlement in the 

Island</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155102"/>
<p>Island. In 1595 and 1598 a number
of Dutch Colonists settled ar Antagonist
Bay on the East Coast. In 1643 the
French made their first, settlement a 
St. Lucia and Fort Dauphin, but 
previous to this, the English had formed
a colony on the South West Coast. The 
French abandoned their settlement
in 1672, and not until 1745 did they
establish themselves at St. Mary, a 
small Island on the East Coast and
at Foule Point on the same coast. In
1876 the French withdrew entirely from 
the mainland of Madagascar. In
1810 the English captured the Islands
of Mauritius and Bourbon and their 
dependencies, and on the 25th of May,
1816, the governor of Mauritius took
formal possession of Madagascar
in the name of the British Crown.
In 1817 all rights possessed by Great
Britain were ceded to Radama)
with whom they made a Treaty of 
Friendship and commerce, and en-
sured tthe addition of the export slave-

trade</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155119"/>
<p>trade. Radama I. conquered the 
Takalava of His reign there was not 
a single tribe in Madagascar that
had not submitted to His power. Such
is a brief history of the French connec-
tion with Madagascar up to the date 
of 1817.</p>

<p>These difficulties can be generally 
divided into three heads. I The Laborde
difficulty; II The Dhou" Trade" affair; III.
The claims to the protectorate by France
on the Northwest portion of Her
Majesty's dominions. Out of these
three have given all the recent com-
plications, and the present threatened
absorption or dismembermen of Ma-
dagascar.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to call to your 
attention before taking up the discu-
ssion of the first of thse causes that
it is a law of this country that no 
land can be actually sold to forei-
gners of any nationality; but they are
permitted by treaty to lease, or sent
lands, houses, or storehouses any length 

of</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155138"/>

<p>of time not exceeding twenty five years +,
(vide Treaty of Peace Friendship and Com-
merce between America and Madagascar
Article III, section I and article V amending
Treaty with Great Britain of the 27th.
June 1865 and with other Powers).</p>
