<p>No. 18. Consular Series<lb/>
Legation of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia Liberia,<lb/>
Jan. 30 1899.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit
to you the intelligence,
that in obedience to your
No. 5 of July 15, 1898, demanding
of me to give reasons why
they Cape Coast Castle Agency,
should be continued; and
your No. 8, of Oct., 6, 1898,
informing me that all correspondence,
concerning said
Agency, would be held in
abeyance until the desired
information, relative, to said
Agency, shall have been
furnished. In my replies,
I have endeavored in
<catchwords>No.</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll6-2212.jpg"/>

No. 2, of Aug., 29, 1898, to give,
what then, appeared to be general
reasons why said Agency
should not be discontinued.</p>

<p>In my No. 28, of Sept. 22, 1898,
I suggested, that should a
United States Cruiser visit
this coast, with instruction to
take me to Cape Coast Castle,
during the mouth of
Dec., 1898, I would visit
said Agency, during the stay
of said Cruiser. In my No. 12,
of Nov. 16, 1898, I assured
you, that in case said
Cruiser did not come, in
December 1898, that I would
visit said Agency early in
1899. Failing to receive a more
direct order, to draw upon
the Special or Emergency
Fund and to visit said
Agency, I have endeavored
to obtain the desired information,
by correspondence
<catchwords>but</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll6-2213.jpg"/>

but having totally failed in
my efforts; as per my letter
of advice, relative to drafts of
January 6, 1899, I did draw
my draft, No. 21 for One Hundred,
Twenty-five Dollars,
upon the Secretary of State;
on account of Special or
Emergency Fund, preparatory
to embarking upon
the next English Steamer
for Cape Coast Castle.</p>

<p>The following, may; therefore,
inform you that I
have this 30th day of January,
1899, left the Legation in
the hands and care of the
Secretary thereof, Hon. Jas.
Robt. Spurgeon, and do
embark for Cape Coast
Castle.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant;<lb/>
Owen L. W. Smith,<lb/>
M. R. and C. General.</p>

<p>Inclosure
1. Dispatch No. 19 of Jan.
30, 1899.
2. Advice as to Draft.</p>
