<p>Sir</p>

<p>In reply to your letter of the 22nd instant,
relative to the detention by Mr. Hird of Consular archives
for rent. I am directed by His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief 
to inform you that the proper course would 
be for you to apply to the legal tribunal of this
settlement, for the purpose of determining the question 
whether or not Mesrs Harris &amp; Co's agent was justified 
in detaining the consular property referred to, for
their rent, as this is a legal question, which the Judge, 
and not His Excellency is to decide.</p>

<p>His Excellency therefore cannot interfere with 
Messrs Harris &amp;Co's agent under the circumstances disclosed 
in his assertion of a legal right.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your most obdt Servant<lb/>
