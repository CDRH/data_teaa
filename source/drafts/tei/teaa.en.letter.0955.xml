<p>Consulate General of the United States,<lb/>
Monrovia, December 31st., 1877.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit herewith my report for the quarter ending this day. It is regretted that my most strenuous efforts are futile to procure figures showing the exports and imports of Liberia. My own endeavor together with those of others employed for that purpose have been put forth during the past three months without satisfactory <catchwords>result</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honorable<lb/>

result in that direction. Indeed, it was mentioned as cause for complaint against the Secretary of the Treasury, during his Impeachment trial, now progressing, that the Liberian Treasury Department make no showing of that nature. The finances of the country remain in an impotent condition. There is not one dollar in available money in the Treasury with which to redeem the national currency; and the current expenses of this Government continue to be defrayed by paper hypothecating the Government's Revenue. It is now the season in Liberia for harvesting <catchwords>the</catchwords>

the Coffee. There is a <sic>perceptable</sic> increase of the coffee crop but not so great an increase perhaps by one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, more or less, as was expected. Heretofore, but one American house has been engaged regularly, in sending vessels to Liberia; it was therefore a satisfaction that during the month of November, the Barkantine "General Sedgwick," owned by Mansfield &amp; Roberts, Boston, called at several of the Liberian ports and met with prospect sufficiently encouraging to determine their Agents to <catchwords>recommend</catchwords> 

<pb n="Roll3-2033.jpg"/>

recommend the sending of two or more vessels annually to Liberia. And I am informed they will probably establish a branch house at Grand Bassa. I am desirous of using this occasion, I am fearful, at the risk of intrusion upon the valuable time of the Department to invite attention to the difficulty and loss experienced by Liberian Planters from the want of machinery to extract the coffee berry from the hull in which it grows. At present the coffee berry is beaten from the outer hull in which it grows, <del>with</del> with <catchwords>an</catchwords>

an ordinary mortar and pestle, and the planter sustains a loss thereby of about two in eight pounds. If some machinist in America would invent a cheap machine for hulling coffee, he would find a ready and growing market for the same. However, the poverty of the Liberian planter would seem to demand a machine to be worked by hand rather than by steam.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir:<lb/>
Very respectfully<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
J. Milton Turner</p>
