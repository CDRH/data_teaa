Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia;
May 16, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
transmit to you the
intelligence that the West African
trade has so increased
in volume, coupled with
the prospect of the South
African trade as to induce
The Elder, Dumpster Co. of
Liverpool, to run seven
steamers to Monrovia
monthly, each being
mail matter, and four
calling only for the mails
and Kroo Bays. I have
the honor to be yours &amp;c &amp;c.

without reasonable cause, to comply with this section, he shall for each offence be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds; or if he

expression "dangerous goods" means aquafortis, vitriol, naphtha, benzine, gunpowder, lucifer matches, nitro glycerine, petroleum, any explosives within
