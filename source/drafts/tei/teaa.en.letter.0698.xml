<note>Department of State Received Oct 4 1884</note>

<p>Translation</p>

<p>May 24, 1884</p>

<p>I, Ranavalomaryaka III. Queen of 
Madagascar, send these greetings to Our
Brother, His Excellency the President of the 
United States of America.</p>
    
<p>The wish to prove, how great is the 
friendship and amity that so happily exists
between Our Government, and that of Your
Excellency in sending to Your Excellency
these presents and good wishes for the 
prosperity of the American Republic
and the happiness of your people. It is
Our earnest wish to so forward the progress 
and civilization of my people; to 
so exhibit to the World my intention to 
place my Dominions on that footing promised 
all Nations, whose policy is broad
and liberal, and to so elevate the character
of Our country by a proper observance
and understanding of these laws which 
bond and protect the various Powers; that 
Our voice may be heard in the Councils
of Christian countries, and respect paid 
to Our just demands. But we are
surrounded by difficulties. Our steps 
<catchwords>entangled</catchwords>

<pb n="20170614_155425"/>
    
entangled by political differences. We do not
understand and Our people threatened with 
all the <sic>calamites</sic> of a foreign war. To whom 
can We turn in these Our troubles, but to
that Great Nation in the West who ever had 
been Our kind friend, who sets to the World
so great an example of the success, and
blessings of free civilization and who, in 
the remembrance of her own early struggle
for independence, can, but sympathize
with Our Dominions still young in its
new history. We well understand that 
the policy of the Republic is neither one
of aggression or aggrandizement. We well
remember that all the intercourse between
the many American citizens who have
come to Our Dominions and my Government 
has given us much pleasure and
caused us no difficulties. We understand 
that the policy of the American Republic 
is the extension of commerce, the increase
of learning, the fostering of those manufactures 
that are of benefit to man, and
the upholding of all those just laws
that protect and make happy her citizens.    
    
<pb n="20170614_155433"/>  
 
We wish to benefit ourselves by these things
to live in peace with all men, and to develop
like industries, to promulgate corresponding
law, and to bring Our Dominions in closer
commercial relations with the American 
Republic. In earnest view of these things,
therefore, I Ranavalomaryaka III, Queen 
of Madagascar, hereby solicit from Your 
Excellency the President of the United 
States, the friendship and assistance of 
the United States in these Our troubles. I 
request of Your Excellency the President
the Mediation of the Republic in my 
present difficulties with the Republic
of France. We request of Your Excellency
the appointment of a committee of arbitration
consisting of equal numbers of
American, Malagasy and French
members to discuss the causes of my
present difficulties and the just settlement 
of them. We request of Your
Excellency a <sic>speady</sic> reply to this Our 
communication that Our troubles may 
cease, and through your great friendship,
We may be at peace to pursue

<pb n="20170614_155441"/>

Our policy of advance and of civilization.
I have instructed my Prime Minister to 
communicate with Your Excellency on
this subject, and to express fully, in detail
the desires of my Government. Given
at Our Court, Masoandro, this twenty-sixth 
day of Adijady (twentieth of
May), in the Year of Our Lord 1884,
and in the first year of Our reign.</p>

<p>Saith your good friend<lb/>
(signed) Ranavalomaryaka<lb/>
(Countersigned) Rainilaiarivony</p>
