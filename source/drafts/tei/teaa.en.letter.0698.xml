<p>I, Ranavalomanja III. Queen of 
Madagascar, send these grettings to Our
Brother, His Excellency the President of the 
United States of America.</p>
    
<p>The wish to prove, how great is the 
friendship and amity that so happily exists
between Our Government, ad that of Your
Excellency in sendinf to Your Excellency
these presents and good wishes for the 
prosperity of the American Republic,
and the happiness of your people. It is
Our earnest wish to so forward the pro-
gress and civilization of my people; to 
so-exhibit to the World my intention to 
place my Dominions on that fooling pro-
mised all Nations, whose policy is broad
and liberal, and to so elevate the character
of Our country, by a proper observance
and understanding of these laws which 
bond and protect the various Powers; that 
Our voice may be heard in the Councils
of Christian countires, and respect paid 
to Our just demands. But we are
surronded by difficulties, Our steps 

entangled</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155425"/>
    
<p>untangled by political differences. We do not
understand and Our people threatened with 
all the calamites of a foreign war To who 
can We turn in these Our troubles, but he
that Great Nation in the West who ever he 
been Our kind friend, who sets to the World
so great an example of the success, and
blessings of free civilization and who, in 
the rememberance of her own early struggles
for independence, can, but sympathyize
with Our Dominions still young in its
new history. We will understand that 
the policy of the Republic is neither a
of ggresion or aggrandizement. We will
remember that all the intercourse between
the many American citizens who have
come to Our Dominions and my Govern
ment has given us much pleasure and
caused us no diffculties. We underestimate 
that the policy of the American Republic 
os the extension of commerce, the increase
of learning the fostering of those manu
factures that are of benefit to man, and
the upholding of all those just laces
that protect and make happy her citizens</p>    
    
<pb facs="20170614_155433"/>   
<p>We wish to benefit ourselves by these things
to live in peace with all men, and to develop
like industries, to promulgate corresponding
law, and to bring Our Dominions in closer
commercial relations with the American 
Republic. In earnest view of these things
therefore, I Ranavalomanyaka III, Queen 
of Madagascar, hereby solicit from your 
Excellency the President of the United 
States, the friendship and assistance of 
the United States in these Our troubles. I 
request of Your Excellency the President
the Mediation of the Republic in my 
present difficulties with the Republic
of France. We request of Your Excellency
the appointment of a committee of arbi-
tration consisting of equal numbers of
American, Malagasy and French--
members to discuss the causes of my
present difficulties and the just settle-
ment of them. We request of Your
Excellency a speady reply to this Our 
communication that Our troubles may 
cease, and though your great friend-
ship. We may be at peace to pursue</p>

<pb facs="20170614_155441"/>
<p>Our policy of advance and of civilization
I have instructed my Prime Minister to 
communicate with Your Excellency on
this subject, and to express fully in detail
the desires of my Government. Given
at Our Court, Masoandro, this twenty-
sixth day of Adijady (twentieth of
May), in the Year of Our Lord 1884
and in the first year of Our reign.
Faith your good friend
(signed( Ranavalonmanjaka
