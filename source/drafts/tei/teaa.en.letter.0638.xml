<ab>Consulate of the United States of
America ar Bathurst
1st March 1862</ab>
    
<p>Sir,
I have delayed forwarding the annual
Report of the trade and commerce of the 
Gamb ia for the last year in anticipation od 
Mr Consul Uptons return from the states for him 
to do so but as that Officer has not yer arrived, I 
will no longer defer during se. Tberewith I have
th pleasure to forwar you also the report of
Henry Rider Esquire Consular agent for the 
Sierra Leone district.</p>
    
<p>The year 1861 has, I am happy 
to say been a more prosperous one for the trade and
commerce of the Gambia than either of the two 
previous years the yield of the groundnut crops was
more abundant and consequently the natives who cultivate
them, were enabled to purchase more largely of American
and European goods. The increased demand
in France for Groundnuts for <unclear/> purposes.

Honorable 
W.H. Seward
Secretary of State for the 
United States</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_101433"/>
    
<p>makes the French merchants and Traders keen
competitors with the English in the purchase of these
nuts from the natives and finding has the 
latter gives the preference to many of the English
articles of manufature the French have of late
introduced the system of trading with the natives
for Cash instead of the Barter Trade with good
hitherto + exclusively pursued and to so great are
extent has this Cash Trade been introduced that
it has materially affected the importation of goods
and a consequences deficiency in the Colonial Customs
Revenue has taken place.</p>

<p>The Colonial Legislature with a 
view to meet this altered state of Trade has lately 
passed An Ordinance (which however was not 
yet been confirmed of Her Majesty) abolishing thr 
four per cent advalorem duties hitherto paid upon
the importantion of any goods into the Colony and
have adopted an export duty of one and a half
cent per Bashel of 20lbs on Groundnuts and /our
<unclear/> each on Hides by this new systen of station
the man who trades with Cash will contribute
equally towards the Colonial Revenues with the 
man who trades with goods.</p>
    
<p>The important differences in the 
United States has during the last twelve months
prmisely affected the importation of American</p>   
 
<pb facs="20170616_101439"/>
    
<p>for do which will observe by Table Not has
fallen off nearly one third whilst the Exports
remains nearly the same the Produce being 
bought by Bills or Cash instead of being in
Exchange for American Manufacturers.</p>
    
<p>Pea Nuts no longer arriving in the 
northern from the southern ports of the Union
has created a greater demand for those raused
in African the best quality of which is to be
had in the Gambia.

I have the honor to be 
Sr,
Your Most Obedient 
Humble Servant
Thomas Rover
Acting United States Consul</p>
