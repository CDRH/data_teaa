<p>Revolting Savage Rites.</p>

<p>A Vivid Description of Mission Life in Africa.</p>

<p>A Terrible Picture at Cruelty Practised by Fetish Priests&#8212;Human Flesh at Public Sale.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>The Rev. Ferdinand <unclear>Meshiel</unclear> and the Rev. William <unclear>Connaughton</unclear> have arrived from Africa, where they have been converting the natives along the gold coast, around the White Nile and in the Soudan. The society of which they are members is known as the Society of African Missions. An interesting history of the perils of mission life was graphically related by Father <unclear>Meshiel</unclear>. From the reverend father's account human sacrifice and slave trading are still extensively carried on. Father <unclear>Meshiel</unclear> said that at Lagos, near Sierra Leone, where the parent house is established, natives are quite well educated.</p>

<p>"The natives of the second generation," the priest said, "may be called members of a civilized community. At Porto-Novo, Lagos, <unclear>Abekouta</unclear> and other stations it is not rare to find native children carrying off the prizes from the children of European parents who are domiciled in these localities. When a boy has attained the age of thirteen years he is advised by the missionaries themselves to choose a wife from among the girls of the convent school. Agriculture and the various trades are becoming factors in the community. The country was frequently devastated by famine. Whenever the rain fell too abundantly the fruits which constitute the staple diet of the natives, rotted and starvation followed. Corn not being subject to such damage, and bearing easily two crops a year, the people regard its introduction as a gift of Providence.</p>
