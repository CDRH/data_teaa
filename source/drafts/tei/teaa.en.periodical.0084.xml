<p>Revolting Savage Rites.</p>

<p>A Vivid Description of Mission Life in Africa.</p>

<p>A Terrible Picture at Cruelty Practised by Fetish Priests&#8212;Human Flesh at Public Sale.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>The Rev. Ferdinand <unclear>Meshiel</unclear> and the Rev. William <unclear>Connaughton</unclear> have arrived from Africa, where they have been converting the natives along the gold coast, around the White Nile and in the Soudan. The society of which they are members is known as the Society of African Missions. An interesting history of the perils of mission life was graphically related by Father <unclear>Meshiel</unclear>. From the reverend father's account human sacrifice and slave trading are still extensively carried on. Father <unclear>Meshiel</unclear> said that at Lagos, near Sierra Leone, where the parent house is established, natives are quite well educated.</p>

<p>"The natives of the second generation," the priest said, "may be called members of a civilized community. At Porto-Novo, Lagos, <unclear>Abekouta</unclear> and other stations it is not rare to find native children carrying off the prizes from the children of European parents who are domiciled in these localities. When a boy has attained the age of thirteen years he is advised by the missionaries themselves to choose a wife from among the girls of the convent school. Agriculture and the various trades are becoming factors in the community. The country was frequently devastated by famine. Whenever the rain fell too abundantly the fruits which constitute the staple diet of the natives, rotted and starvation followed. Corn not being subject to such damage, and bearing easily two crops a year, the people regard its introduction as a gift of Providence.</p>

<p>"After the kings, the priests who practice medicine are, perhaps, the greatest personages in this region. They need only to threaten to leave, and generally they at once obtain any concession they demand from these sovereigns. The huts of the common people are made of bamboo cane, thatched with palm leaves. Fishing and hunting are but little practiced, as they require bodily exertion, which is not agreeable to the natives. The disposition of these people is so mild it is a mystery how they can indulge in the practice of the cruelties, such as human sacrifices, for which they have become famous. The missionaries believe that but for the fetish priests, who are exceedingly shrewd and who have a strong interest in perpetuating these bloody sacrifices, as their power is based on them, the country could be easily civilized. Under the reign of <unclear>Gaezo</unclear>, the late king of Dahomey, human sacrifices had become comparatively rare; but his successor, <unclear>Grery</unclear>, a slave to the fetish priests, has revived them and now they are practiced with greater cruelty than ever. The number of slaves who annually perish in this way is estimated at several hundreds. The king of Dahomey is, as is know, the most ferocious and powerful ruler in the whole region. During  ten months in the year he makes incursions into the neighboring territories, capturing a large number of slaves. In this work he is chiefly assisted by his two celebrated regiments of Amazons. The prisoners taken during these expeditions are divided into three classes. One class is sold to the slave merchants of the interior, another, chiefly women, are fattened and sold to butchers, who, revolting as the fact may be, even to relate, openly sell human flesh in their shops. The third class is reserved for the sacrifices which take place in August and September, during the celebration of the "Grand Customs." These ceremonies have a double purpose: pacifying the god of war <unclear>Ogun</unclear>, and other deities; recalling the memory of dead kings and sending them supplies of men and provisions.</p>

<p>"Among these savages exists a belief that a man passing into the future life takes with him all that is placed in his grave. For this reason, in Dahomey, as in other savage countries, victims and prisoners are placed in the tomb. Not long since the king of Porto Novo died of poison administered to him by a rival for the throne. The funeral ceremonies lasted nine days. During the whole of this time numbers of victims, destined for the "Grand Customs," were sacrificed every night in the fetish forest. The missionaries living in the neighboring huts could hear the cries of the <sic>suferers</sic>, whose mutilated bodies, arranged in lines, were seen every morning in the public square of the town. The heads had been cut off and nailed along the walls of the palace. At 8 o'clock on the morning of the ninth day the new king and his wife, preceded by the fetish priests moved in procession to the sacred</p>
