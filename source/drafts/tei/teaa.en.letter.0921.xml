<p>No. 8.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia Liberia 30th September 1875</p>

<p>Sir/</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit herewith my report for the quarter ending this day. You will observe by reference to the accompanying statement of account, marked No. 5. that I have endeavored to obey the instruction conveyed to me in the Department's No. 94. relating to certain corrections which were desired to be made in my reports for the fourth quarter 1874, and for the first quarter 1875. I hope I am successful in my attempt to comply with the Department's desire in that respect, and those corrections will prove satisfactory. As I have not received your <catchwords>acknowledgement</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honorable<lb/>
John L. Cadwalader<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State Washington.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-1030.jpg"/>

acknowledgement of my report for the last quarter, ended June 30th 1875, I have continued, in this report, to draw for rent on account of money advanced by me for office rent, and reported through a voucher sent forward as an inclosure of my No. 4. transmitting my report for the quarter ended June 30th 1875. Referring to my No. 5. - Consular, I have to state that I have credited the Government in this report for $125.00/100, the amount of my draft dated May the 5th 1875; which amount, I believe, was inadvertently omitted from my report of 30th June 1875.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir/<lb/>
With high considerations<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
J Milton Turner</p>
