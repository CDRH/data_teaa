<p>Important Dates in the Development of the Congo State.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The founding of the Congo State resulted from the opening of Central Africa through the explorations of Mr. Henry M. Stanley. An association was quickly formed, under the leadership of King Leopold of Belgium, for further exploration, with a view to occupation of the country. The association, having received recognition by the Powers, became the Congo State.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanley arrives at the mouth of the Congo, completing his journey across Africa, August 12, 1877.</p>

<p>Comité d'Etudes du Haut-Congo, formed by King Leopold for study of conditions in the Congo territory, November 20, 1878.</p>

<p>Stanley revisits central Africa, under the auspices of the Comité, August, 1879, to June, 1882; December, 1882, to January, 1884.</p>

<p>The Comité becomes Interenational Association of the Congo, January, 1883.</p>

<p>Tentative treaty of England with Portugal, recognizing Portuguese claims in West Africa as opposed to those of International Association, February 26, 1884.</p>

<p>Recognition of International Association of the Congo by the United States Government, April 22, 1884.</p>

<p>The Association promises to France a reversionary interest in its territories, April 23, 1884.</p>

<p>International Association recognized by Germany, November 8, 1884.</p>

<p>International Conference of fourteen Powers convenes at Berlin for consideration of problems in Congo territory, November 15, 1884, to January 26, 1885.</p>

<p>International Association recognized by Great Britain, December 16, 1884; by Italy, December 19, 1884; by Austro-Hungary, December 24, 1884; by other Powers, December 27, 1884, to February 23, 1885.</p>

<p>The king bequeaths to Belgium the succession to his interests in the Congo State, August 2, 1889.</p>

<p>International Conference convenes at Brussels to devise measures for suppression of slave trade, November 22, 1889, to July 2, 1890.<lb/>
At this Conference the Congo State seeks and gains permission for imposition of import duties.</p>

<p>Conditions in the Congo State.</p>

<p>Grounds for Action by the United States Government.</p>

<p>A Synopsis of Case as viewed by the Conference by which Memorial of April, 1904, was addressed to Congress. *</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The Societies composing the conference appear in the case not primarily as complainants, but as transmitters of testimony received by them which their moral responsibility requires them to make known (1).</p>

<p>The Defendant in the case is King Leopold, not Belgium (2).</p>

<p>THE CASE UNIQUE.</p>

<p>A single man claims unlimited sovereign power and proprietorship in a territory embracing one million square miles.</p>

<note>* For Memorial see <hi rend="italics">Senate Documeent No. 282, 58th Congress, 2d session.</hi></note>

<note>1 For relation of missionaries to the issue, see in general pp. 16, 17 of Memorial. Cf. Rev. J. H. Weeks in letter to Congo officials: "I deeply regret having to write this letter to you but I cannot sit quietly and see these unfortunate folk crushed out of existence by oppression and cruelty without making a protest in the name of religion and humanity."</note>

<note>Compare also: "A white officer unacquainted with the missionary whom he was addressing, after a cruel raid, jokingly remarked that he had killed many people and secured a fine lot of curios. He said that while his soldiers were firing upon the villages the people ran wildly about, crying, 'Sheppite, Sheppite.' It was their name for Rev. W. H. Sheppard, whom they were beseeching to come to their aid."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Cited in Memorial to Congress, p. 17.</hi></note>

<note>2 "The union between Belgium and the new State shall be exclusively personal."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Action of Belgian Parliament, April, 1885.</hi></note>

<note>Belgium holds treaty relations with the Congo State substantially identical with those sustained by other Powers.</note>

<pb n="p6"/>

<p>THE ORIGINAL RECOGNITION OF THE CONGO STATE.</p>

<p>This recognition secured through professions of philanthropy and interest in the promotion of unrestricted commerce for all nations (3).</p>

<p>THE REQUEST MADE IN MEMORIAL.</p>

<p>Congress is asked to take action in promotion of an impartial investigation of present conditions in the Congo State.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Grounds upon which the request is made:</hi></p>

<p>I. An impartial inquiry is demanded in view of prevalent reports of grave abuses in the administration of the Congo State.</p>

<p>The reports are sufficient in volume and definiteness to justify and require impartial investigation.</p>

<p>They present a dreadful catalogue of alleged wrongs, involving accusation of excessive cruelties, massacres, mutilations, cannibalism, and the threatened extermination of tribes and depopulation of large territories.</p>

<p>They imply not exceptional instances of inhumanity but its prevalence throughout the vast rubber district, as the result of the system maintained by the State.</p>

<note>3 "Our only program, I am anxious to repeat, is the work of moral and material regeneration."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">King Leopold, 1885.</hi></note>

<note>"The objects of this Society are philanthropic. It does not aim at permanent political control but seeeks the neutrality of the valley."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Message of President Arthur, December, 1883.</hi></note>

<note>"The fundamental idea of this program is to facilitate the access of all commercial nations to the interior of Africa."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Prince Bismarck's opening address as President of Berlin Conference</hi></note>

<note>Compare also represeentatations made at Brussels:&#8212;</note>

<note>"When we have made sufficient progress in all directions to allow of the natives asking for our protection, and when we are strong enough to grant it, no one will venture any longer to capture or transport slaves."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Report Congo Administration, read at Brussels Conference.</hi></note>

<note>"For Belgian trade, as for that of traders of every nationality established in our territories, we have an equal solicitude. All appreciate the security they enjoy under the Congo Government."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Remarks of Representative of Congo State in Conferencee at Brussels.</hi></note>
