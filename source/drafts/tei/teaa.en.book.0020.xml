<p>Important Dates in the Development of the Congo State.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The founding of the Congo State resulted from the opening of Central Africa through the explorations of Mr. Henry M. Stanley. An association was quickly formed, under the leadership of King Leopold of Belgium, for further exploration, with a view to occupation of the country. The association, having received recognition by the Powers, became the Congo State.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanley arrives at the mouth of the Congo, completing his journey across Africa, August 12, 1877.</p>

<p>Comité d'Etudes du Haut-Congo, formed by King Leopold for study of conditions in the Congo territory, November 20, 1878.</p>

<p>Stanley revisits central Africa, under the auspices of the Comité, August, 1879, to June, 1882; December, 1882, to January, 1884.</p>

<p>The Comité becomes Interenational Association of the Congo, January, 1883.</p>

<p>Tentative treaty of England with Portugal, recognizing Portuguese claims in West Africa as opposed to those of International Association, February 26, 1884.</p>

<p>Recognition of International Association of the Congo by the United States Government, April 22, 1884.</p>

<p>The Association promises to France a reversionary interest in its territories, April 23, 1884.</p>

<p>International Association recognized by Germany, November 8, 1884.</p>

<p>International Conference of fourteen Powers convenes at Berlin for consideration of problems in Congo territory, November 15, 1884, to January 26, 1885.</p>

<p>International Association recognized by Great Britain, December 16, 1884; by Italy, December 19, 1884; by Austro-Hungary, December 24, 1884; by other Powers, December 27, 1884, to February 23, 1885.</p>

<p>The king bequeaths to Belgium the succession to his interests in the Congo State, August 2, 1889.</p>

<p>International Conference convenes at Brussels to devise measures for suppression of slave trade, November 22, 1889, to July 2, 1890.<lb/>
At this Conference the Congo State seeks and gains permission for imposition of import duties.</p>

<p>Conditions in the Congo State.</p>

<p>Grounds for Action by the United States Government.</p>

<p>A Synopsis of Case as viewed by the Conference by which Memorial of April, 1904, was addressed to Congress. *</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="body">

<p>The Societies composing the conference appear in the case not primarily as complainants, but as transmitters of testimony received by them which their moral responsibility requires them to make known (1).</p>

<p>The Defendant in the case is King Leopold, not Belgium (2).</p>

<p>THE CASE UNIQUE.</p>

<p>A single man claims unlimited sovereign power and proprietorship in a territory embracing one million square miles.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="notes">

<note>* For Memorial see <hi rend="italics">Senate Documeent No. 282, 58th Congress, 2d session.</hi></note>

<note>1 For relation of missionaries to the issue, see in general pp. 16, 17 of Memorial. Cf. Rev. J. H. Weeks in letter to Congo officials: "I deeply regret having to write this letter to you but I cannot sit quietly and see these unfortunate folk crushed out of existence by oppression and cruelty without making a protest in the name of religion and humanity."</note>

<note>Compare also: "A white officer unacquainted with the missionary whom he was addressing, after a cruel raid, jokingly remarked that he had killed many people and secured a fine lot of curios. He said that while his soldiers were firing upon the villages the people ran wildly about, crying, 'Sheppite, Sheppite.' It was their name for Rev. W. H. Sheppard, whom they were beseeching to come to their aid."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Cited in Memorial to Congress, p. 17.</hi></note>

<note>2 "The union between Belgium and the new State shall be exclusively personal."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Action of Belgian Parliament, April, 1885.</hi></note>

<note>Belgium holds treaty relations with the Congo State substantially identical with those sustained by other Powers.</note>

<div2 type="body">

<p>THE ORIGINAL RECOGNITION OF THE CONGO STATE.</p>

<p>This recognition secured through professions of philanthropy and interest in the promotion of unrestricted commerce for all nations (3).</p>

<p>THE REQUEST MADE IN MEMORIAL.</p>

<p>Congress is asked to take action in promotion of an impartial investigation of present conditions in the Congo State.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Grounds upon which the request is made:</hi></p>

<p>I. An impartial inquiry is demanded in view of prevalent reports of grave abuses in the administration of the Congo State.</p>

<p>The reports are sufficient in volume and definiteness to justify and require impartial investigation.</p>

<p>They present a dreadful catalogue of alleged wrongs, involving accusation of excessive cruelties, massacres, mutilations, cannibalism, and the threatened extermination of tribes and depopulation of large territories.</p>

<p>They imply not exceptional instances of inhumanity but its prevalence throughout the vast rubber district, as the result of the system maintained by the State.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="notes">

<note>3 "Our only program, I am anxious to repeat, is the work of moral and material regeneration."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">King Leopold, 1885.</hi></note>

<note>"The objects of this Society are philanthropic. It does not aim at permanent political control but seeeks the neutrality of the valley."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Message of President Arthur, December, 1883.</hi></note>

<note>"The fundamental idea of this program is to facilitate the access of all commercial nations to the interior of Africa."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Prince Bismarck's opening address as President of Berlin Conference</hi></note>

<note>Compare also represeentatations made at Brussels:&#8212;</note>

<note>"When we have made sufficient progress in all directions to allow of the natives asking for our protection, and when we are strong enough to grant it, no one will venture any longer to capture or transport slaves."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Report Congo Administration, read at Brussels Conference.</hi></note>

<note>"For Belgian trade, as for that of traders of every nationality established in our territories, we have an equal solicitude. All appreciate the security they enjoy under the Congo Government."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Remarks of Representative of Congo State in Conference at Brussels.</hi></note>

<p>The witnesses represented in the reports include:</p>

<p>(1.) Missionaries of all American and English Societies having work in the Congo and of all stations of these Societies which are in the vicinity of the rubber-producing district (4).</p>

<p>The missionary a reluctant witness. It is his desire and it is for his interest to seek the favor of government. The peril of charge of disloyalty (5).</p>

<p>The silence of Belgian missionaries not unnatural, in view of their two-fold relation with the king (6). Their testimony, if favorable to the Government, should not fail of consideration in the impartial inquiry sought.</p>

<note>5 "The Governor made inquiry concerning the atrocities which he had reported and finally said to him: 'If you continue to demand investigation in these matters, we will make a charge against you. The natives say you have told them not to being India rubber to the State.' He denied this, but was again threatened by the Governor, who said: 'That means five years' imprisonment.'"&#8212;<hi rend="italics">From interview with Rev. E. V. Sjoblom, Ikoko, Africa.</hi></note>

<note>Compare report of Governor General of the Congo State in recent issue of <sic>Officiel</sic> Bulletin: "Certain officers have complained of the arrogant attitude the native population assumes when it has been subjected to certain influences. Once cannot escape the fact that this situation reveals itself in the neighborhood of certain * * * missionary posts. * * * I have already called the attention of the Government to this grave situation and to the measures it is likely to entail if it continues. Already our local officers have found it necessary to act in order to safeguard the authority of the State, and if it is necessary the Governor General will consider the advisability of making use of the means that the decree of September 15, 1889, puts at his disposal in the case of strangers who use their influence over the natives against the State."</note>

<note>Compare letter of Rev. Mr. Harris, written at Baringa, July 2, 1904,&#8212;printed in London <hi rend="italics">News</hi>:</note>

<note>"I called the judge's attention to the imprisonment of women and children who would not be released until their husbands and fathers satisfied the rubber demand. * * * In June sentries were sent into the towns with instructions to forbid any individuals going to the mission schools and services. Thus instead of two hundred or three hundred we had not a soul."</note>

<note>6 "The Belgian missionaries are subjects of their king, which at once makes their position very difficult. Then again, all these Belgian establishments on the Congo receive grants from the Congo Government, and it would be a very serious matter, indeed, for them if they were to say publicly what they know to be the case and what some of them privately write to their friends."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">E.

<note>8 Mr. E. J. Glave, having been associated with Mr. Stanley in the earlier days in Africa, revisited the Congo after an absence of six years. His record of his experiences as he made his way over the route followed previously with Mr. Stanley is given in articles "New Conditions in Central Africa," in the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine,</hi> volumes 53, 54. At first he is perplexed and incredulous. Successive entries in his journal show the growth of his deep indignation and abhorrence. For citations, see Memorial to Congress, pages 7 and 9, and pamphlet "Treatment of Women and Children in the Congo State," pp. 3, 5-10.</note>

<p>Counter-testimony explained in part as relating to other than the rubber districts (11)  as due to admiration for public works from which the native derives no advantage (12) or as former earlier testimony afterward repudiated (13).</p>

<p>The later judgment of Mr. Stanley (14).</p>

<p>Testimony favorable to the Congo State should receive recognition in the impartial investigation asked. It does not constitute a reason for refusing investigation.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="notes">

<note>11 Compare Sir Harry Johnston, quoted as a defender of the king: "My own reports on the administration of the Congo Free State referred only to a small portion of the northeastern zone." See, also, statement of Mr. Grenfell and other members of "Natives' Protection Commission," in White Book, Africa, page 21, No. 10&#8212;that "it was only possible for them to act within the very narrow scope of their personal experience in the lower country, far removed from the immense rubber districts."</note>

<note>12 Compare expression in editorial in <hi rend="italics">N. Y. Times</hi>, October 1, 1904:</note>

<note>"We have examined with some care the statement of the Belgian Minister to this country in the current number of the <hi rend="italics">North American Review</hi> with reference to "Conditions in the Congo Free State." If the article was intended as a refutation in advance of the memorial that will be laid before the President by Mr. Morel, the honorary Secretary of the Congo Reform Association, we fear that it will prove inadequate. It can be admitted without hesitation that the commercial progress of the Congo State is all that Baron Moncheur represents it, without meeting the charges of cruelty and greed that are brought against the Belgian officials in the Congo State. These charges have been brought forward by the Congo Reform Association in detail and with evidence of much apparent force."</note>

<note>Compare statement of Mr. Casement as to native hospital and Government works at Leopoldville: "The native hospital is an unseemly place. I found seventeen sleeping-sickness patients, male and female, lying about in the utmost dirt * * * one (a woman) had fallen into the fire just prior to my arrival. She had been well bandaged, but was still lying out on the ground, with her head almost in the fire. * * * All were very near their end, and two days later I found one of them lying dead out in the open. * * * In somewhat striking contrast, * * * I found within a couple of hundreds of yards the Government workshop for repairing and fitting the steamers. Here all was brightness, care, order, and activity, and it was impossible not to admire and commend the industry which created and maintained this useful establishment."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">For full statement, see page 74, Memorial to Congress.</hi></note>

<note>13 Compare Sir Harry Johnston: "In the Itura District I saw nothing to take exception to, but the report of Consul Casement, whom I know to be a competent, trustworthy, and absolutely impartial official of great experience in various parts of Africa, convinces me that the charges of maladministration of native affairs in the north and central parts of the Congo Free State are only two well founded."</note>

<note>14 "The last year of his (Stanley's) life was certainly embittered by the growing conviction that he had been the indirect means of placing in the Congo basin a power more unscrupulous and disastrous in its result than might have grown up under the flag of Islam."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Sir Harry Johnstone, an intimate friend of Mr. Stanley, in "Good Words," August, 1904.</hi></note>

<p>THE POSITIVE TESTIMONY TO THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVE WRONGS IS REINFORCED BY ACKNOWLEDGED FACTS WHICH GIVE PLAUSIBILITY TO REPORTS OF PREVALENCE OF ATROCITIES.</p>

<p>(1.) The avowed policy of the king is that of taxation by enforced labor (15).</p>

<p>(2.) In securing enforcement of labor, the king's policy is that of pitting representatives of one tribe against other tribes (see Verner, article in <hi rend="italics">Forum</hi>) July, 1904 (16).</p>

<p>Native soldiers, regular and irregular, number nearly 30,000, being greatly in excess of the military force of colonial powers in West Africa (17).</p>

<p>The soldiery described by Mr. Glave and M. Pickard as of savage ferocity (18).</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="notes">

<note>15 <hi rend="italics">The king's defence of the policy of compulsory labor.</hi></note>

<note>"The legality of taxes is not affected by the mode of payment.</note>

<note>"As they (the natives of the Congo) have no money, a contribution in the shape of labor is required from them.</note>

<note>"Payment of taxes is obligatory everywhere, and <hi rend="italics">non-payment involves measures of compulsion."&#8212;Reply of king's representative to British Parliament.</hi></note>

<note>16 "The secret of the king's success is in controlling the natives by pitting one tribe against another.</note>

<note>"As soon as any district had been brought under the control of the whites, and the natives had been rendered tractable, the soldiery was immediately recruited from the latter, and was almost always sent away to distant tribes, which it could be used to subjugate and control. This last policy is the keynote of the whole system. Leopold governs one African tribe with soldiers recruited from another. Many a State post has been manned by less than half a dozen white men with hundreds of these black soldiers in the midst of hostile population. It is a most extraordinary phenomenon. The adage 'divide and conquer' was never better illustrated."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">S. P. Verner (quoted as defender of Congo State) in Forum, July, 1904.</hi></note>

<note>17 The army outnumbers the force maintained in West Africa by England, France, and Germany combined.</note>

<note>18 "Their ferocity equals that of a pack of hounds hunting their quarry."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">M. PIckard, Belgian Senator, "En Congolie," p. 201.</hi></note>

<note>"The black soldiers are bent on fighting and raiding; they have good rifles and ammunition * * * and want to shoot and kill and rob, whether the victim be man, woman, or child."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">E. J. Glave, Century Magazine, volume 53, p. 908.</hi> Cf. in Supplement, ¶'s 55-57.</note>

<note>Compare description of <hi rend="italics">sentry</hi> given by Mr. Pickersgill, in "Report on Congo Independent State." "A sentry on the Congo, is a dare-devil aboriginal, chosen, from troops impressed outside the district in which he serves * * * armed with a rifle * * * . He is located in a native village to see that the labor for which its inhabitants are responsible is duly attended to. If they are India rubber collectors, his duty is to send the men into the forests and take note of those who do not return with the proper quantity. In every matter connected with the Government he is the <hi rend="italics">factotum</hi>, as far as that village is concerned, of the officer of the district."</note>

<p>(3.) The great excess of exports over imports an indication of abnormal and oppressive conditions (19).</p>

<p>(4.) The king's persistent opposition to an impartial investigation, which should secure him a notable vindication, is not easily accounted for upon the theory of innocence of wrong.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">Neither members of Congress nor our citizens are asked to accept the reports of atrocities as conclusive. The request made in the memorial asks only that Congress shall favor an impartial investigation of existing conditions.</hi></p>

<p>THE INADEQUACY OF ANY INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE KING.</p>

<p>The natives dare not give testimony in an investigation conducted by the government under which they suffer.</p>

<div2 type="notes">

<note>19 Of ten African possessions of European powers all but two show a large excess of imports over exports. The Congo State shows (1889-1902) imports of $17,500,000; exports, $37,000,000. Of this importation 70 per cent. represents supplies for Government, stores for the railway, arms, and ammunition. During the four years cited exports in the Congo State have increased by 40 per cent.; imports diminished by 25 per cent. "These figures alone show wherein the policy of King Leopold, as applied in the Congo, differs from that of every civilized administration. The India rubber which comes from that great country, where the native alone can gather it, is not bought, but forced out of the people by the lash and rifle."&#8212;<hi rend="italics">E. D.

<note>"The chief informed the sentinel that he would report to the commissary that the sentinel had killed his father * * * then he went away from the village. * * * But the sentinel caught the chief * * * they flogged him until the blood streamed down his back. * * * The soldier took his gun and leveled it close to the chief's heart.

<p>THE CLAIM MADE BY THE KING THAT SUBMISSION TO AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE CONGO STATE.*</p>

<p>The sovereignty of the Congo State is definitely limited by engagements made with the Conference of Berlin and the Conference of Brussels (22).</p>

<p>The Conferences declared themselves guardians of the people of the Congo basin (23).</p>

<p>These Conferences definitely reserved the right to review and revise the agreement entered into by their members (24).</p>

<p>The king conceded the guardianship of the Powers by appealing to the Conference at Brussels for such revision of the action at Berlin as would permit imposition of import duties.</p>

<p>Promotion of the well-being of the natives was involved as definitely in the engagement at Berlin as provision for freedom of trade; and investigation of reported dereliction respecting either feature of the engagement falls within the jurisdiction of the Powers with whom the engagement was made.</p>

<p>II. An international inquiry is demanded, not only for investigation of reports of atrocities, but for consideration of other issues with which a commission created by the king is obviously incompetent to deal.</p>

<p>(1.) THE KING'S CLAIM OF EXCLUSIVE OWNERSHIP OF A VAST TERRITORIAL DOMAIN, AS RESPECTS BOTH LAND AND PRODUCTS.</p>

<p>800,000 square miles of territory are held to be the king's property, the natives being represented as robbers if using or selling its products, and the foreign trader being subject to punishment if attempting to buy any product of the native (25).</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">This involves for the natives:</hi></p>

<p>Permanent loss of ancestral rights to gather products, to fish and hunt.</p>

<p>Permanent denial of hope of acquiring lands or the privilege of trading.</p>

<p>Deprivation of healthful motives for labor.</p>

<p>Subjection to force as the alternative for healthful motives.</p>

<p>"Hitherto the native had been looked upon by the merchants established in the country as the owner of the products of the soil which the merchants wished to acquire by legitimate purchase, as everywhere else in Western Africa. Commercial relationship had been established in the ordinary way, and long before the Congo State had come into existence, the native, attracted by the merchandise offered for sale by the white man, gathered the produce of the forests and brought it to the factory for sale. * * * The native is relegated from the position of owner of the forest products, which he has been accustomed to sell, to that of a lawless and ownerless serf on the estate of 'Bula Matadi.'"&#8212;<hi rend="italics">Morel in Leopold's Rule in Africa, pp. 32. 33. cf.

<p>The claim that sovereignty involves the right to wholesale monopolization of the territory and its products cannot be regarded as valid in the case of the Congo State.</p>

<p>If so extreme a claim, involving complete extinction of native rights, were tolerable in respect of sovereign Powers in general, when assuming administration over a dependent people in a newly-opened territory, it would appear to be voided in this instance by the limitation upon sovereignty involved in the engagements made by the Congo State with the Powers (32). For this policy of monopolization is plainly antagonistic to that material and moral well-being of the people which the State pledged itself to conserve (33), as well as to rights in trade guaranteed to other nations.</p>

<p>In any view, it would appear that this monopolistic system is so related to engagements made by the State that it should receive the attention of the Powers committed to guardianship of the native people.</p>

<p>(2.) THE KING'S ASSERTION OF SOVEREIGN RIGHTS, UNLIMITED BY ANY FORM OF RELATION TO THE POWERS (34).</p>

<p>This creates occasion for judicial decision as to the international relations of the king's government.</p>

<p>Possibly it should involve consideration of certain questions never yet adjudicated by the Powers.</p>

<p>In what way did the rule of the "International Association" become the independent unlimited sovereignty of the head of that Association? (35).</p>

<p>Does the power&#8212;pertaining only to absolute despotism&#8212;of bequeathing sovereignty at will belong to the king and to his successors?</p>

<note>35 There is no record of action by the Association, which had been recognized as a State. Apparently the only action taken was that of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and Senate, which on the 28th of April, 1885, and 30th of April passed the concurrent resolution: "His Majesty, Leopold II, King of the Belgians, is authorized to be the king of the State formed in Africa by the International Association of the Congo." Notification to the foreign powers of the king's action was made on the 1st of August, 1885.</note>

<note>By what authorization did the king, when becoming ruler, assume the position of an absolute sovereign rather than a position allied to that held by him in Belgium as "one of the trustees of the national sovereignty"?
