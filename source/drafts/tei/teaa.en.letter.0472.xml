No.6
United States Consulate
Sierra Leone
June 2nd 1874

Sir
I have the honor to request that you will furnish this Consulate with a small paved of assorted Stationary and a Consular Seal for immediate use. 

The "Albertina" has sailed from this port I believe for Boston, but being under English colors, the Consignees did not apply to me for any papers. She is commanded by Captain Joseph Upton, and was consigned to Mess Randall and Fisher of this place, from Boston, by (I believe). Mess Roberts and Rideout of the latter named place.

I have the honor to remain
Sir
Your obedient Servat
Hah Lyons
U.S. Consul for
Sierra Leone

The Honble J.C.B. Harris
Assistant Secretary
Department of State
