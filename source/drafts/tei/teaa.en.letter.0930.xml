<p>No. 17.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia Liberia May 25, 1876.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit herewith copy of notes exchanged with U.S. Vice Consul General Moore upon the subject of his intention to visit the United States and Europe, to which parts that officer is now absent. The enclosed papers were placed upon my desk some days since, but my health has been so exceedingly feeble of late that I have been unable to forward them until now. Whenever I shall have received the permission, in the interest of my health, to take at least temporary <sic>abscence</sic> from my duties here, (for which I have already applied to the Secretary of State) I shall regard it my duty to hasten with all possible speed from the deadly influences 
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honorable<lb/>
John L Cadwalader<lb/>

<pb n="Roll3-1073.jpg"/>

of this climate. And in that event, Mr Moore's absence continuing, I shall either offer the temporary charge of the Archives of my office to one of Mr. Moore's bondsmen, or suggest to the Department the name of some other individual to be Vice Consul General of the United States instead of Mr Moore. <sic>Refering</sic> to my despatch made date April the 21st and covering my report for the last quarter, I beg to state that owing to my more severe illness that despatch was inadvertently numbered <unclear>22</unclear> as though it belonged in the series of numbers employed by me in my diplomatic correspondence with the Department; I have therefore respectfully to request that the despatch be so changed as to read No. 16.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir:<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
J Milton Turner</p>

<p>U.S. Vice Consulate Genl.<lb/>
Monrovia, April 18, 1876.</p>

<p>His Excellency<lb/>
J Milton Turner<lb/>
U S Minister Resident<lb/>
&amp; Consul General</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>It now becomes my duty to inform you, that within a few days, I purpose to visit the United States of North American and to extend my visit to Europe. I shall likely be away from my official post as U.S. Vice Consul General for at least six months. I trust no pressing necessity may require the active discharge of any of the functions of my office while away. I am about to make my present visit to America and Europe from two motives, namely, a desire to see these countries, and as a means of recruiting my health. I shall sail on the U.S. barque Liberia.</p>

I have the honor to be under sentiments of profound respect and esteem</p>

<p>Consulate General of the U.S.<lb/>
Monrovia April 20th 1876</p>

<p>Gabriel David Moore Esq.<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul Genl.<lb/>
Monrovia &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 18. inst. informing me of your purpose to visit the United States of North America and Europe, and that you will likely be absent from your official post of duty for at least six months. In reply I beg to say that the present enfeebled state of my health from which it is very improbable that I shall recover for a considerable length of time, makes it my duty also shortly to leave my post, which in your absence, will necessitate my leaving someone in charge of the Archives of my Legation and Consulate General.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
J Milton Turner</p>
