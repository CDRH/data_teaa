November 20th, 1890.

<ab>The Honorable James G. Blaine,<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</ab>

<ab>Sir,</ab>

<p>In the short interview with which you honored
me on Friday last, I informed you I that had been
commmissioned by the President of Liberia to approach
your government with the hope that you would be
induced to make such a deminstration in our favor
as will prevent foreign nations from making 
encroachments on our territory.</p>

<p>Unfortunetly for me, the presence of business did 
not permit of your giving me time to lay the facts 
before you and you told me to call the next day, which
I did and called again on the following Monday 
and Tuesday; but with no better success owing to the 
great pressure of business in your office.</p>

<p>As I had to leave your city, on Tuesday last I make
bold to adopt this method of laying the matter before
you, trusting that you will be kind enough to give it 
your consideration.</p>

<p>In the year 1885 a French Man of War came in to
the harbour of our capital, Monrovia and the  
com

<catchwords>mander</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170616_150118"/>

mander <unclear>called</unclear> upon the President. During the conversation
the commander said that he had stopped 
at Bereby &#8212; a place within our boundray line and 
had an interview with the chiefs. The President said 
"Why did you stop there and have that interview? Do 
you not know that territory belongs to Liberia?" The
commander replied that he did not know it belonged to Liberia 
and that he had been instructed by his government to
stop there and have that interview.</p>

<p>After the departure of the vessel, the President instructed  
our representative in Paris to call the attention of 
the French Government to the action of their office and 
to point out the fact that our boundary in the Southeast 
extended to the San Pedro Riveria as you will see 
by referring to the Imperial Atlas in your office and 
that they had virtually admitted it by their Naval Charts
and otherwise.</p>

<p>The French Government then claimed that they 
had commercial treaties with the chiefs of Bereby
as old as 1846- I think; but we have deeds of Cession
of that territory made to us as far back as 1836, <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<p>We laid this matter before your government and asked
for your kind offices; and in a Despatch to Wm. McLean
dated, January 13th, 1886, Mr. Bayard instructed how to 
interview and to say to the French Government "We exercise 
no protection over Liberia; but the circumstances, that
the Republic originated through the colonization of 
American citizens and was established under the 

<pb facs="20170616_150126"/>

<unclear extent="one word"/> sanction of this Government give us the rights 
as the next friend of Liberia to aid her in preventing any 
encroachment of foreign powers on her territorial 
soverneignty and in settling any dispute that may arise.
The Southeastern boundary at the River San Pedro has never
been questioned and the powerful sanction of general 
admission for many years".</p>

<p>The matter has remained in abeyance as we supposed 
since that time; but it lately came to our knowledge that 
one Captain Binger &#8212;  who was a prominent officer in 
the late expedition against the King of Dahomey &#8212; claim
to have made explorations in the near and Southeast
of Liberia and he has published, in a "Supplement Le Temps 
Mars 1890, a map reprenting Liberia as a very
narrow strip along the coast, representing the country in
the immediate rear of Liberia as far as Musardu as unexplored
country and liable to become a Protectorate of France,--
although our Mr. B. Anderson had explored that country as 
far as Musardu and published an account of this journey 
and cutting off our territory on the Southeast up
to the Cavalla River thus taking the very territory in dispute
and which Mr. Bayard says belongs to us by "the powerful
sanction of general admission for many years". The territory was taken
from us is represented in his map of French Territory.</p>

<p>Whilst the French have not as yet made an open 
movement towards taking posession of the territory 
yet, Mr Secretary under the circumstances we feel

<catchwords>warranted</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170616_150135"/>

warranted in appealing to your Government as
next Friend" and asking you to make such a demonstration 
in our favor as will prevent Foreign Governments 
from making such encroachment on the territory.
If your powerful Government would make us a present 
of one of your smallest steam-gunboats to be used in 
guarding our coast from foreigners and preventing
them from settling at points remote from our civilized 
settlements and tampering with the aboriginals we feel
that our territorial limits will not be encroached upon.
Mr. Secretary my Government believes that if you will 
be pleased to give us the benefit of your kind offices and
and will induce this Excellency the President to recommend 
the giving of this vessel to Liberia we shall be successful
and the very recommendation by the President 
will indicate to the world the friendship of the United 
States for our little Republic.</p> 

<p>Trusting, Mr. Secretary, that you will bring this 
matter to the notice of his excellency the President,
and you will advise his recommending it to the Congress
and trusting that you will pardon my trespassing on 
your valuable time.</p>
