<p>Hôtel de Russie, State
   Hamburg, July 9, 1862</p>

<p>Sir,
        Having left Liberia in March
   duly vested with authority to transact
   any necessary official business for the
   government of Liberia with any other
   government, it wasw my original
   purpose to visit the United States
   of America, after having finished
   any business with Her Britannic
   Majesty's government,. Being anxious
   to negotiate a treaty on behalf of the
   government of Liberia with the United
   States government, I have for nearly
   three months been watching the
   progress of the passage of the bill</p>

<p>To Hon. W.H. Seward,
        Sec. of State,
            <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0174.002.jpg"/>

<p>by Congress recognizing and
   establishing diplomatic relations between
   the United States government and 
   the government of Liberia, the
   passage of whcih I was highly 
   gratified to see announced in the 
   papers a week or two before I left
   London;p and I would have
   immediately gone over to the United
   States for the purpose aforesaid, but was
   deterred by the consideration that very
   likely the great pressure of business
   upon, and the prosperity and anxiety
   of the government of the United States,
   growing out of the unrighteous rebellion
   of some of the States, might render
   such a proposition inopportune, just
   now, to secure such speedy action by
   the government of the United States
   as the necessary shortness of my 
   visit there would require.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0174.003.jpg"/>

<p> As I purpose returning to
   London, and shallf probably then
   decide whether I will visit the
   United States early in August, or
   return to Liberia from London, the
   object of this communication is
   simply to enquire what will be Your 
   Excellency's pleasure in teh promises;
   first, whether Your Excellency favors the
   negotiation, on behalf of the United States
   government, of a treaty of amity and
   commerce with the govenrment of 
   Liberia: if so, then through what 
   medium do you suggest that it shall
   be affected? by my visiting the United 
   States for that purpose, or your
   govenrment empowering some one to
   affect that object with me in London?
   Either method will be agreeable to
   me. I and my <unclear/> and
   I think it very imnportant, that</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0174.004.jpg"/>

<p>a treaty should be negotiated between
   the two governmentsw before my return 
   to LIberia andd the commencement of
   the session of the Liberian Legislature.
   The Hon. Mr. Adams, your minister 
   at the COurt of St. James, has
   already signified to me the pleasure
   it would afford him to do so, if duly
   authorized by his government.</p>

<p> I shall feel particularly obliged
   if Your Excellency can, amid the
   pressure of business, conveniently 
   place one in possession of a reply
   to this communication in all of 
   next month (August).</p>

<p> I have the honor to be
     Your obdt. servant,
        Stephen "A" Benson</p>
