<p>Hôtel de Russie,<lb/> 
Hamburg, July 9, 1862</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having left Liberia in March
duly vested with authority to transact
any necessary official business for the
government of Liberia with any other
government, it was my original
purpose to visit the United States
of America, after having finished
any business with Her Britannic
Majesty's government. Being anxious
to negotiate a treaty on behalf of the
government of Liberia with the United
States government, I have for nearly
three months been watching the
progress of the passage of the bill
<catchwords>by</catchwords>

<fw type="address">To Hon. W. H. Seward,
Sec. of State,
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</fw>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0174.002"/>

by Congress recognizing and
establishing diplomatic relations between
the United States government and 
the government of Liberia, the
passage of which I was highly 
gratified to see announced in the 
papers a week or two before I left
London; and I would have
immediately gone over to the United
States for the purpose aforesaid, but was
deterred by the consideration that very
likely the great pressure of business
upon, and the prosperity and anxiety
of the government of the United States,
growing out of the unrighteous rebellion
of some of the States, might render
such a proposition inopportune, just
now, to secure such speedy action by
the government of the United States
as the necessary shortness of my 
visit there would require.</p>

<p><catchwords>As</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0174.003"/>

As I purpose returning to
London, and shall probably then
decide whether I will visit the
United States early in August, or
return to Liberia from London, the
object of this communication is
simply to inquire what will be Your 
Excellency's pleasure in the promises;
first, whether Your Excellency favors the
negotiation, on behalf of the United States
government, of a treaty of amity and
commerce with the government of 
Liberia: if so, then through what 
medium do you suggest that it shall
be affected? by my visiting the United 
States for that purpose, or your
government empowering some one to
effect that object with me in London?
Either method will be agreeable to
me. I am very desirous, and
I think it very important, that

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0174.004"/>

a treaty should be negotiated between
the two governments before my return 
to Liberia and the commencement of
the session of the Liberian Legislature.
The Hon. Mr. Adams, your minister 
at the Court of St. James, has
already signified to me the pleasure
it would afford him to do so, if duly
authorized by his government.</p>

<p>I shall feel particularly obliged
if Your Excellency can, amid the
pressure of business, conveniently 
place one in possession of a reply
to this communication in all of 
next month (August).</p>

<p> I have the honor to be
Your obdt. servant,<lb/>
Stephen A. Benson</p>
