<ab>
The Governor of the Côte d'Ivoire,
to Mister Minister of the Colonies
in Paris

<p>
Mister Minister,
By dispatch of last June 15th,
you had wanted to transmit to me the copy
of a letter by which our ambassador
near Saint-Siège informs that his
attention was called by cardinal Rampolla
on a report in which the apostolic Prefect
of the Côte d'Ivoire indicates an increase of
the treatment of blacks, masacres of slave and
human sacrifices that are practiced
to the doors of Grand-Bassam.
</p>

<p>
I have the honor of informing you
that following this communication I
called P. Ray, apostolic prefect, and I prayed to him
to supply me with some explanations on the facts
that could have motivated on his part the
appreciations also manifestly exagerated,
not to say inexact. The result of the
formal declarations that he made to me throughout
our interview, that it is not to his knowledge
that the human sacrifices were produced
since he
</p>

<pb facs="20160613_154116.jpg"/>

<p>
since he has been in the colony; that he
never incidentally in any letter
talked of increase in the treatment of blacks,
or masacres of slaves. The Apostolic
Prefect would be narrow-minded, in a
letter addressed to the Superior of the Society
of African Missions of which the headquarters is
in Lyon, <unclear>j</unclear> recount that in Memni, village
situated in the Attié at about 70
kilometers to the North of Grand. Bassam,
two indigenous, threatened to be put to
death for an unknown motive,
would be missionaries in the house of the
missionnary, and would have escaped
those who were pursuing them that thanks
to the intervention of this last. The fact
would happen around the month of august of
last year. P. Ray added
that he had written that which preceeds without
attaching the least importance,
and he expressed to me his regrets that one
exagerated the terms of his letter.
</p>

<p>
I did not remark to him
in the least the bit of
correction of his conduct, and invited
him to show henceforth more
caution in his correspondences
with his ecclesiastic superiors. I 
made the promise. I have place to
believe that P. Ray is guilty
of my observations, and that he will no
longer expose himself, by the letters written
carelessly
</p>

and warned a time not very far away 
where these odious costumes will have
definitively ceased./.
