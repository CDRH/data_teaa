<p>Consulate of the United States 
of America at Sierra Leone<lb/>
19th February 1864.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge 
a communication 
from you desiring me 
to obtain for the United 
States Government a parcel 
of the "Bean of Calabar" also 
a similar parcel for Doctor 
Albert Dung of New York.</p>

<p>The article does not grow 
in or adjacent to this Colony 
and is little known 
here but I have been fortunate 
enough to meet two gentleman, 
by this packet form down 
the Coast (Calabar) of whom 
I have obtained some information 
with regard to the 
article. It is not cultivated 
<catchwords>at</catchwords>

<fw type="address">F. W. Seward Esq<lb/>

&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c </fw>

<pb n="70"/>

at present but there beginning 
to be a demand for 
it it will probably attract 
the attention of the natives 
very soon as an article of 
trade, it is used by them 
in some of their ceremonies 
and is <sic>know</sic> by the name 
of the "Ordeal Bean" investigation 
has proved it of great 
value in many other diseases 
as well as those of the eye.</p>

<p>One of the Gentlemen kindly 
gave me a letter through the 
influence of which I hope 
to obtain a parcel to send 
as requested, I have also 
written Capt Alexander of the 
bark "Thos Pope" bound for 
Fernando Po requesting him 
to endeavor to get me some 
of the beans.</p>

<p>The beans are sold in 
<catchwords>England</catchwords>

<pb n="72"/>

England at half a crown 
an <sic>once</sic> for medicinal 
purposes.</p>

<p>Mr Baillie the gentleman 
from whom I received 
the letter has kindly promised 
to send me from 
England an essay on the 
article by a Doctor Fraser 
who has given great attention 
to it and through 
whom it was brought to the 
notice of the medical world 
Hoping I may soon be 
able to report success in 
my efforts</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your ob'd't servant<lb/>
Henry Rider<lb/>
U.S. Consular Agent</p>
