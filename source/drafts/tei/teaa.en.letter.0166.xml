<p>L de R. de Verge Esq.re

<p>Mossamedes 1st. of November 1882.</p>

8th of October per S.S. Beuguella. "Samples of produce
alone this district:" Enclosed please find a bell a bading
for a bol of samples of the produce of Mossamedes, which 
will be beut by the first pocket, and in a few ays, the
said samples consist of:
orchilla
Beans
And corn
Rum
Wheat
Almeidina</p>

<p>What regard to these samples, I must say
that Almeidina from which
50 p.C. of good Indian Rubber is
attached, what regards to wheat,
this country has not produced anything to 
speak of as they have not lumed their
attention to its cutiration, bu lately and it has had
<unclear></unclear> to consider all the extent, and they sanguinely expect
a great result.</p>

<p>Produce exported from this District: as follow.
Cides
Wax
Ivory
Dried Fish
Brine
Orchilla
Almeidina
Cotton </p>

<!--this list is in a colum right beside the first list-->

above</p>

<p>American shipping. "The Am: Ship "Milton" Capt S.B.
letter, entered this port on the 1st of October, sailed on 
the 19th of the same month; Whalins"</p>
<p>On the 12th of the same month ent.d American Back
"Alice Knowles" Capt. Promas Foster, came in to repesh
and returned Whalins on the 19th of the same. 
On the 10th of the same month and Am. Ship
"Eliza Adams" Capt. Walter F. Hourland, also came in
to repesh and returned Whalins on the 21st ditto.</p>
<p>From the back "Alice Knowles" the sailor Henry
Williams was landed sick, and who will go
on to your city by the first packet, hearing a 
certificate from this agency dated October 26 1882.
The "Eliza Adams" shipped on the 25th <unclear/> H sailors
2 of which have array immediately after signing 
their articles and receiving 8 dollars and 50 court
in advance; they were arrested 2 days after 
the sacking of the ship, and I <unclear></unclear>
sending them on to <unclear>yaen</unclear> consulate by first
favorable opportunity that you may dispose
of them as you may think fit; it is probable
that I shall have to advance the money for 
their passages of which I will duly advise
you. Their names are "Jared Miller" and
"Charles Fins". Another sailor, his name of 
"Augustus Fernandes" ran away from the said
ship, and came today to present himself to 
me; I shall send him also to you with

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0166.003"/>

the other 2. and advise the amount of passagers
and expenses which I have advanced them here.
It seems to me proper to send them to Loauda 
that it may be known here after to others 
coming here in future, that such acts will not
be comenainced without being punished
according to Law.</p>

<p>Being all for the present, I remain with all
due respect and consideration</p>
<p>"Signed" <unclear>Joas</unclear> L. Forres
W.S. Consul agent </p>
