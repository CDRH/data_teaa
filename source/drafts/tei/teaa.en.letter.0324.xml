Gaboon November 29th 1866

Gentlemen, 

<p></p>Your circular dated 
Nov. 26th 1866, having been handed to me 
today I hasten to inform you that 
I take into deep consideration the general 
opinion whuch have deetated it,
but presuaded as I am that the decisions 
of the Admiral Commanding in
Chief have been inspired as much be 
the guest interest which he take in 
countries of which the principles 
considerayion has been intrusted to him, as 
by a profound knowledge of the means 
of assuring theit industrial and commercial 
development it cannot enter into
my mind to hesitate a moment in executing 
those decisions at the time appointed
and to these full extent.

<p></p>Nevertheless that period is far destiant 
many serious reasons leave me to think 
that this Admiral may arrive before 
January 1st of next year in which 
can you cannot doubt that I will 
<pb facs="20170615_114049"
lay your Circular beforehand and he 
himself will consider the observations 
which it contains, but are those observations 
sufficently clearly expressed?

<p></p>I do not think so I believe that a 
serious decision would put them in 
a better l*unclear at the same time it 
would dissapate certain event opp*
economy certain impossesions 
without any real foundations which 
appear to me to be shown in the spirit 
of your letter.

<p></p>Consequently I have the honor to 
request that you will call at the Government 
House on Monday most at
2 p.m. Assisted by the administrative 
myself by yhr most cannot 
reconcile your testimonials which 
are in point of fact those of the 
Circular with the strict executive 
of the orders of the Admiral Commanding 
in Chief perhaps I may 
be able to make you understand 
better both the *unclear and that *unclear*

<pb facs="20170615_114053"
motives which have dictated his decision.

<p></p>Finally it is not to be doubled that from
this discussion I shall obtain a duper
insight into your opinions and that will 
aid me much in acting as your inter-
trader with the Admiral Commanding in Chief.

<ab></ab>Be patient to accept Gentlemen, 
the assurance of any distinguished 
consideration,

<ab></ab>Post Captain, officer of the legion 
of honor Commandiant of Gaboon.

Commandant Superior on interior 
Signed, Aube
