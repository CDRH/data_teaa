Hon. Jas. I. Porter 
Acting Secretary
Washington U.S.A

Sir, 
<ab></ab>Your two despatcched
of the 2nd of Oct. last have been
received 

<ab></ab>The two despatches referred to on
First, the official notice of the 
acceptance of the resignation of 
Graham C. Campbell.

<ab></ab>Second the offcial notice that I 
have been appointed "Acting Commercial
Agent" of Gaboon.

<ab></ab>Enclosed with these two despatches 
was a "form of official bound" to 
be expected by myself and  returned 
to the Department.

<p></p>Permit me, one reply to say that
I respectfully decline to execute 
the Bond-- and for the following 
reasons. Necessarily a great
length of time must elapse 
before my letter could reach you. 

<pb facs="20170615_145742"

<ab></ab>And a longer time before I 
could *unclear* the segnatums of 
Boudsmen in America.

<ab></ab>And in addition to that the time 
necessar for you to obtain the 
recognition of the French Government,
and afterwards revisit 
to me the Certificate of Assortment.

<p></p>Already more than 
three months have passed since
the official notice was given from 
this office by Graham C. Campbell
that he would leave.

This is, of course. due suly to the 
length of time necessary for the 
exchange of letters.

Perhaps, for the present I may 
not remain here longer than three 
or four months.

<p></p>And it will be will sight impossible
for me to receive the Certificate 
before the expiration 
of that time.

<p></p>I shall continue to earn for 
the office--the permittion and 

<pb facs="20170615_145750"
the books-until I find it necessary 
to return to America.

Then I will learn the can of these 
things to the member of this 
Mission who will succed we 
at this station.

I am not aware that I who have been 
"Acting" Com. Agnt. only have
any authority were to name a 
successor.

<p></p>Allow me to suggest thatI and 
others of our Mission think it 
would be will for the government 
of the U.S.to enquire into the 
trade of this part of the Coast.

One English prime, and one Ferman 
prime, do aninexcuse 
trade ben- besides swaller primes.
But still then is a demand 
for some American productions
*unclear* the demand than 
is for either English or German 
the lighter and better. American 
edge tools and axes. shovels, 

<pb facs="20170615_145810"

plows. chiscles, the plain 
substatial American furniture,
and American pine lumber 
for building purposes.

<p></p>Only one American sailing 
vessel calls regularly at this 
port, and that about twice a year.

<ab></ab>Our profession forbids ud giving 
as much time to the collection 
of statistics in regard to trade-
imports/ exports as should be douer by the one 
holding this office.

<ab></ab>I trust that I way to able to 
gather a fine statistics concerning 
trade on this part of the Coast.

For the present.

I remain 
Yours respectfully,
H.C.Gaulk
