<p>No. 52 U.S. Consulate, Goree Dakar
Oct.27th 1886

To the Honorable 
James D. Porter
Ass't Secretary of State

Sir,
Before American merchants
can fairly compete with Europeans
in the opening markets of the World,
they must learn that in some
countries superior packing is held
to be a factor fof prime importance:
that in places where good <unclear/>
are not to be had and there are 
but few practiced laborers, egg-slate
packages, no matter how choice
the Goods they contain, are sure
to be discriminated against. And
this American fault in packing 
is the more ot be regretted because
it is precisely in those countries
when the best of packing is of necessity
required that the profits are always the greatest.

<p>where heads have follow out, so 
that the condition in which a 
shipment of American Flour justly 
reaches the warehouse  of the foreign
buyers is often such as to excite his
disgust if not his indignation.
The buyers of flour in intertropical
countries are seldom men who like 
making up for omissions of shippers
by comparing barrels themselves under
a brailing sun, and the upshot 
of the matte is, they give their 
preference to foreign flour because 
the packages are better, only dealing 
with Americans just enough to keep
their European Agents from imposing 
high prices on them.</p>    
    
<p>There is also much prejudice
against American Flour-barrels
because they do not sufficiently
exclude the air, which causes the 
Flur to spoil quickly. French flour-
barrels besides being lined with 
paper have thirty hoops each and 
the heads well secure. Such</p>

<p>Among the articles which 
Americans are interested to export 
abroad, but which frequently are 
not packed sufficently well for 
the purpose. Flour may be intended 
as disering perhaps the first notice.
Almost all newly developed countries
consume Flour largely, and as payment 
in such countries is usually made in 
saw products which Americans 
require for manufactoring purposes,
there s a double motive for dealing 
with them direct, which dealing 
Americans shoulf not forego by
refusing to take into account the 
necessities of their situation. Now 
in such countries, where teams are 
always scarce, such articles of Flour 
have sometimes ro be transported
quite long distances by rolling, with 
are American od having a continued 
white trail of flour all along the 
route, interperend have and there 
with heaps of it mixed and dit-</p>

<p>packages present their contents
against even wet, and other things
being equal it would be indeed
disposing if foreign flour thus 
protected were not preferred in way 
competition market. American 
Flour- barrels for export should
have at least sixtee well-
driven hoops each: the chimes
should be well protected and
