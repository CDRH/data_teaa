<p>Salt Pond West Coast Africa<lb/>
4th July 1876</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
U.S. Minister
at Liberia</p>

<p>We the undersigned American citizens doing business in the Gold Coast West Coast Africa as Agents for Messrs Roberts and Mansfield of Boston, there being no U.S. <sic>Counsil</sic> or Commercial Agent on the Coast and <unclear>sharing</unclear> no where means of getting redress humbly beg to submit to <sic>you</sic> notice a copy of what we consider unjust treatment by the Courts of the Colonial <sic>Goverment</sic> hoping you will give it your early and favorable consideration.</p>

<p>We beg to inform you that a Copy of one <unclear>protest</unclear> has been sent to the Secretary of State at Washington, one to the Colonial Governor at Cape Coast and one to Messrs Roberts and Mansfield Boston owners of the vessel.</p>
<p><catchwords>We</catchwords>

<note>Inclosure No. 2</note>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
U.S. Minister<lb/>
Liberia</p>

<p>We James J Pettengill &amp; Robert Everett agents on the West Coast Africa for the firm of Roberts &amp; Mansfield Boston Mass U.S.A. having suffered much inconvenience and severe pecuniary losses in business. Through the "in one <sic>oppinion</sic>" unjust decision of the Courts at Cape Coast and Accru in the Mutiny Case of the Bark Bolivia of Boston and in Subsequently taking the chief mate by force from same vessel, discharging him and compelling the master to pay his passage home by steamer, do by this protest and petition against the acts and decision of the Courts in the above cases and trust your Excellency will take an early opportunity of ascertaining the particulars of the case and give us the same Justice as would be accorded to British subjects in a British Court.</p>

<p>First "We object to the decision of the Court at Cape Coast

<pb n="Roll3-1106.jpg"/>

in trying the crew of the American Bark Bolivia <sic>acused</sic> of mutiny" for simple assault and after being found guilty by the Jury having been discharged by the Court without passing any sentence and ordered to be discharged from the vessel, when as it is our <sic>oppinion</sic> they should have been returned to the vessel to complete the voyage.</p>

<p>Second "We object to the acts and decision of the Court at Accra in <sic>taken</sic> the Chief Mate out of the sad vessel on a summons for debt, as we believe it is according to law, that payment can not be collected for debt contracted by any sailor belonging to any ship unless the contraction of the debt was sanctioned by the master.</p>

<p>We further object to a doctor in the service of the Colonial Government giving the said Mate a certificate stating he is sick and must go home and then the same doctor going into Court in the capacity of magistrates and acting Judge and compelling the Master of said vessel to discharge said Mate pay his debts and send him home by steamer.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-1107.jpg"/>

<p>We object to the second case because even supposing the Mate to have been very sick and needed to go home, we had at that very time a vessel ready to leave for the <sic>the</sic> United States and might have saved expenses, moreover we are of <sic>oppinion</sic> that the Court <sic>exeded</sic> it </p>
