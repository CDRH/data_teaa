<p>Mr. J. H. Smyth to the<lb/>
Second Ass't Sec'y of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Contract with Mrs Matilda A. Roberts, and leave from Mrs. Jane Rose Roberts.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>

<p>The contract of rent made between Mrs. Matilda A. Roberts and late Minister Garnet &amp; lease of the <sic>Robert's</sic> mansion from Mrs. Jane Rose Roberts.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-3055.jpg"/>

<p>No 4.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,<lb/>
Monrovia, La, Aug. 11, 1882.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In your No. 6, dated June 26, 1882, you were pleased to advise Mr. Aenmey, Vice Consul General of the U.S. in charge that, the contract made between Minister Garnet &amp; Mrs. Roberts for a building for the Consulate General–was binding upon the Government for its fulfilment, and that he should 'settle with Mrs. R. upon the most favorable terms of compromise.'</p>

<p>Mr. A. failed, or concluded not <catchwords>to</catchwords>

to proceed in the matter of compromise, because he anticipated my early arrival; and on my arrival requested me to attend to the matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. R. visited me, and after a full canvass of the subject, I <del>concluded</del> succeeded in getting her to wave all claim to two years rent, and to accept in full satisfaction of the contract the balance due for the year 1882, which was $145.00/100; there having been made two payments on account, one of $25.00, and one of $30. I paid the $145. by draft on the Secretary of State in favor of Mrs. Matilda A. Roberts, and took her receipt for the same, which I <catchwords>enclose</catchwords>

enclose as voucher, No. 1.</p>

<p>There remained an unsettled balance of one quarter's rent for the Roberts mansion for the quarter. A portion of this mansion was based by me at the rate of $200. per annum. for the use of the legation, when I was in office, and this building was turned over to my successor Hon. H. H. Garnet, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., but he failed to keep the premises, and to pay for the quarter which expired during his term of office.</p>

<p>I have this day drawn a draft for the due and unpaid December quarter 1881–in favor of the lessor Jane Rose Roberts, for $50.</p>

These two drafts cover all the Government's indebtedness for rent. See voucher No. 2.</p>

<p>With sentiments of high esteem,<lb/>
I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obd't serv't,<lb/>
Jno. H. Smyth, U.S.<lb/>
Consul General.</p>
