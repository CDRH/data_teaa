His Execellency 
H.V.W. Johnson

Mr. President,
When I arrived in the United 
States, on thr 14th September 1890 I
found the country in a great state of excitement consequent on the elections, 
which were held on the 4th of November last.

I found it would be useless to go 
on to Washington then, as Mr. Seemtale*
my Blaine was away on an elections
were over which resulted disastorialy*
for the present Administration in 
nearly all the States divert to 
Washington, on the 10th of Novembe, and 
the next day, Now John U. Smith, with
whom I stopped while in the city, accompanied
me to the State Department, when we found twenty or more
persons, all waiting to get our 

interview

interview with the Secretary. We waited 
about half a day, and were then informed 
that the Secretary would not be at
his office that day, Mr. Smith and I 
called the next day, but after waiting some 
hours he had to leave, but I remained and 
about 1 o'clock thr Secretary came, and
I was admitted to an interview for 
about tem mintues. Mr. Blaine then 
excused himself as the new Spanish 
Minister was thn waiting by appointment
 to be taken to the White House
to be presented to the President. Mr.
Seemtary asked me to call on him the
next day, and instructed the usher to
bring me "right in", as soon as he sat 
to the office. I called the next Saturday
but after waiting until after 12m. 
was told, to the great disappointment 
of all of us then waiting, that the Seemtary **invade
not be at his office that day.

I called at the Department the next 
Monday and Tuesday; but with the same.
One of the gentlemen  that I 
met waiting to see the Secretary, told 

me

me that he had called daily for fourteen 
days, ad when I left, he had not
got been favored with an interview.

I then left Washington, and from 
Philadelphia I wrote a letter to 
Secretary Blaine, copy of which I 
now present. After waiting several 
days without an answer, I wrote 
Mr. Cappinger and requested him to
call upon the Secretary and inquired
whether my letter had been shown 
to him, and feared that it might 
be laid down somewhere and not 
come under his notice. Mr. Cappinger 
wrote me that he had called several 
times at the Department, but without success,
but that he would still try to carry out my wishes

Mr. Blaine received me very 
courteously, and but for the poet that 
the Spanish Minister by his appointment, I
think he would have given me a 
much longer and favorable interview. 
I requested the Secretary 
to send me an answer to 

New York

New York, and prehaps I may get it by next mail.

This matter having been initated 
allowed me to suggest, Mr. President ,
that it be followed up through thr 
State Department, as I deem it 
of great importance, at this time, 
that we have a demonstration of 
friendship from one of the Great Powers
I have the honor to be Mr. President 

Your obident Servant 
W.M.Davis 
Commissioner
