<head type="sub">United States Consulate in Sierra Leone.</head>

<note>May 21, 1881</note>

<p>In our issue for March 17th 1880 we called attention to the necessity of the establishment of a regular salaried Consul of the United States at Sierra Leone, in view of the increasing commercial intercourse of the United States with the colony. We are gratified to learn from Capt. Judson A. Lewis, the United States Consul here, that his Government has by Act of Congress placed this Consulate in class "C" with salary of One Thousand Dollars a year.<sic>"</sic> We sincerely congratulate Capt. Lewis and the Settlement on this result, which we are sure will add to the growing importance of American commerce in this part of Africa; and we feel highly flattered if any words of ours have contributed to this gratifying result. The Americans are contemplating enlarged commercial intercourse with the whole of West Africa, and to facilitate their enterprise they are about to establish a line of Steamers to sail regularly from the principal Atlantic ports of the United States. We learn that as soon as this line is established, the English Steamship <sic>Compainies</sic> will put on additional steamers to meet the competition that will be thus created. If Americans wish to compete advantageously they must neglect no element of success in their undertaking; and among the agencies that will help them will be the establishment of regular and efficient Consuls at the Gold Coast, at Lagos, at Bonny and other important points; and Vice Consulates at smaller points between Monrovia and the Niger, to be under the supervision of the Consulate General at Monrovia.</p>

<head type="sub">American Steamers and a Railroad for West Africa.</head>

<p>The establishment of an American line of steamers to this Coast suggests the necessity of increased facilities for intercourse with the interior. The construction of a railway from some point on the Coast at which the steamers call would be an important auxiliary in their work; and no doubt the clear-sighted promoters of the scheme already have this in view. Three years ago some of the officers of the American flag ship <hi rend="italics">Ticonderoga</hi> made a survey of the St. Paul's River, Liberia, and ran a series of levels along the northern bank and some distance up in the Boporo country, for the purpose of determining the feasibility of constructing a narrow-gauge railroad to connect Monrovia with the Soudan Valley <hi rend="italics">via</hi> Boporo. This survey proved that the engineering difficulties in that region of country would be comparatively trifling.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Monrovia or the St. Paul's River would be one of the most available points for the starting of such a road as it would pass through an entirely virgin country and penetrate to a salubrious region, whose resources for trade, known to be vast, are as yet untouched.</p>

<p>Such facilities for intercourse with the interior with the various appliances of civilization which must follow or accompany them would be one of the most effective agencies for promoting a vigorous colonization of the immigrants from the United States, who would at once reach a healthy and fertile country–an immigration, it is to be hoped, consisting of strong men, able and willing to work, and not a sickly, uncertain horde, living with the utmost difficulty in the country and bent upon a life of ease and political promotion–a class which in the past have done so much to retard the progress of the country.</p>

<p>A means of easy and rapid access to the interior would also be one of the greatest practical agencies in the advancement of missionary work, and would aid in the promotion of the views of Mr. Secretary Gibson on Agriculture as a missionary agency which we published in our last.</p>

<p>We learn that Mr. Consul Lewis, in his official communications to the U.S. Government, is urging the importance of increased facilities with the interior of West Africa.</p>
