<p>US Consulate Goree Dakar
July 13th 1880

To the Honorable
James D Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington

Sir
Before discussing the
subject of the appointment of 
a successor for Mr. Armand,
I desire respectfully to call the 
attention of the Department
with a view to some explanation
of the enclosed copies of letters
received at this Consulate form 
the Legation at Paris. It will
be seen thereby that my request
for a leave of absence to 
visit America preferred in 
my Despatch No. 21 and sebt
Feburary 18th not with an 
unqualified refusal and 
until I know the grounds
</p>

<pb facs="20170619_135346"/>

<p>hardly be esteemed
unreasonable by the Department
that I should be held too
closely by a Consulate
which excarcely pays for 
the veriling it initals.</p>
    
<p>Regarding a Successor
for Mr. Command I know
of no person in Goree
who would exactly answer.
The nearest appraoch to it 
would be Chales de Manfort by 
the present Mayor of Goree
who understands the English
language suffiencently will
and is faulters as to business
qualifications and Character
but holding many colonial 
office he is compelled to
be much of the time absent.
The only other suitable 
person that I proves of in 
my San Searge Strickland
such is noe on a visit 
name to being out my family</p>

<pb facs="20170619_135341"/>

<p>of that refusal I am at 
a loss in preferring another
request which in the not
distant future may be 
absolutely necessary for me.
If it was thought that 
I asked for a visit too
protracted, I have only
to urge <unclear/> custom,
the extreme precautions taken 
by naval vessels while
navigating seen in the good
reason on this coast, and 
above all the malancholy
fate of my colleague Mr.
Armand, whose death was 
caused solely by blood posioning 
from maria. Though habituated
to extreme Southern Cattuder for
the last twenty-five years I 
am suffering some form the 
same cause. I have not been 
six months away from Africa
in eight years, and with 
this fact in view it can
</p>

<pb facs="20170619_135352"/>

<p>and I expect him have 
early in September. It 
is not perhaps delicate 
for a father to recommend
his cover San, and I shall
not so so only to state
facts which under the 
circumstances may be
acted on or not as the
Department shall think 
proper. He is 21 yeats of 
age, was born in New
London, Connecticeit, has 
been literally educated both
classically + commercially
writes an elegant hand 
and can both speak and 
write the French language 
with facility. He was 
with me here all of last
increase and has allogate 
lived as many as three
years in Africa. He has
also been in France,
England and several voyages</p>

<pb facs="20170619_135359"/>
<p>with me at sea mostly
however when he was very 
young. At to political 
opinions neither of as have
can <unclear/> any by means
of a late not from <unclear/>
perhaps but principalty 
from lack of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>My father however was
a life long Commerical, and I 
have always been caussions 
of same bias that easy:
not enough however to make 
me follow that or any party
in measures which an being
fairly examined my judgement
or conscience would condemn.</p>
    
<p>my partion with regard
to the Consulate is this:
as it same without seeking 
an my part so, I am proposed
to port with it as lightly
if it shall so seen expresed
for the Government. If however
it is still intrusted to me</p>

<pb facs="20170619_135406"/>
    
<p>I shall continue to <unclear/>
the both <unclear/> which may 
ability with same close
transportation to the mission
sail allow. For me to 
matte accountant <unclear/>
visits about the Coast in 
composture and it is also 
necesarry that I should
easy <unclear/> to arrange
no that this Consulate 
will that be repeated
and with one apology
for there extended extermies
I am for with respect
Very Truly Yours
Peter Strickland
U.S. Consul</p>
