<p>No. 56</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
APR 26 1890
RECEIVED.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia, March 10th, 1890</p>

<p>Mer. Ezekiel E. Smith
To the Deartment of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Archives of the Consular Agencies at
Grand Bassa and Cape Palmas.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1002.jpg"/>

<p>No. 56.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia, March 10th 1890.</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor respectfully to inform
you that in accordance with the
instructions contained in your dispatch
No 11 of January 8th 1890, I
proceeded to Cape Palmas per s.s. "Ella
<unclear>Waermann</unclear>," leaving here for that point
on the evening of the 20th ult and
arriving there on the afternoon of
the 22nd. </p>

<p>Upon looking around and making
inquiry, I ascertained there was
no American commercial interest
operated at Cape Palmas. Only
one American vessel had touched at
that point during the past three
or four year, and it called in
December 1886 to land emigrants.
There</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1003.jpg"/>

<p>There are, however, a number of
missionaries at Cape Palmas from
the United States, who, under the
direction of Bishop William Taylor,
are laboring with commendable
yeal to christianize and ameliorate
the native African in that
section of Liberia.</p>

<p>I collected the archives of the former
United States' Agency at Cape Palmas
and shipped them to this office. Of which
I enclose an inventory.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 24th per s.s.
"Gertrude <unclear>Waermann</unclear>," I proceeded to
Grand Bassa, arriving there on the morning of the 27th.</p>

<p>Upon observation and inquiry I ascertained
that there was no American 
shipping or commercial interest
conducted at Grand Bassa, consequently,
I had shipped to this office the archives
and furniture of the former Consulate at that place.</p>

<p>Please find enclosed inventory of
said</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1004.jpg"/>

<p>said office.</p>

<p>Returning, I arrived at my port
of duty here on the evening of the
28th <unclear>ultims</unclear>. I was absent eight
days, leaving the Consulate General
in the care of Vice Consul General.</p>

<p>I beg, also, to enclose a statement,
with vouchers, of the actual and
necessary expenses incurred on
the trip. I have this day drawn
draft for said amount.</p>

<p>Hoping the same may meet the approval of the Department.</p>

<p>I am, sir,
your obedient servant,</p>

<p>Ezekiel E. Smith.
U.S. Consul General</p>
