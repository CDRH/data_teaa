<p>Arrival of United States Barque Azor

<note>Department of State Received Jul 3 1878</note>

<p>No 30</p>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
Sierra Leone, 4th June 1878</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I beg to report for 
Your Excellency's information the arrival 
in this port on the 28th of May of the 
American barque "Azor", Captain Holmes,
from Charleston, South Carolina, bound for  Monrovia with emigrants. This vessel 
having drifted to within a short distance 
of this port and being without water and 
in need of medical assistance put into 
this port and received from the consulate 
and likewise from the Colonial Government 
every assistance that could be rendered to 
her. Out of her numerous passengers 
she had nineteen deaths before her arrival 
here, and two died while the vessel lay at 
anchor in this port. On the 1st inst, 

<fw type="address">His Excellency<lb/>
the Honble F. W. Seward</fw>

<pb n="302"/>

the vessel left here in tow of the British 
Mail Steamer "Senegal", and I hope 
that she has 'ere now safely arrived at 
her destination and landed her over 
crowded passengers.</p> 

<p>Without expressing any opinion 
as to whether the "Azor" was properly 
filled out for the large number of passengers 
which she carried, and who I understand 
were sent out under the auspices 
of the Liberian Exodus Irish Stock Steam
Ship Company, I deem it my duty to 
bring the fact and the circumstances of 
her arrival in this port to the Knowledge 
of the Department of State</p>

<p>I have the honor to remain<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
You must obedt servant<lb/>
J. Broadhurst<lb/>
Acting for U.S. Consul</p>
