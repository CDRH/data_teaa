Gaboon Nov. 26th 1866

Monsieur the Commandant Superior 
of the French settlements,
West Coast of Africa 

We the undersigned merchants 
established at Gaboon having been 
made acquirable with the circular 
which was addressed to us by your 
order on the 16th of this month, and 
in accordance with your invitation 
on the occasion of our visit to you 
on the 24th of September last on 
the subject of the circular dated 
the 21st of the smae month 
Have the honor to state to you
that which follows.

The merchantile community of 
Gaboon was painfully impressed 
on learning by the announcement 
contained in your first circular
that the other country having 
thought proper to evade the local 
expenses you should deem it necessary 
to make it support the amount of 
this contain commencing by causing
no to pay for licenses, which or consider 
to be very high if compared to those
paid in France when trade is so much 
more important than have.

That moreever when we established 
ourselves at Gaboon we were far 
from forcing that so sudden a 
change would one day come upon 
us and in a manners so burdensome 
in were so mad. the firtters from 
supposing it suing that the country 
is one of the protest and must son
unhealthy of the Coast of Africa.


With regard to the second circular 
relative to the duties to be informatives 
and Exportationa of merchandise 
we can only repeat to 
you that which we have said
before with regard to the besiners*unclear
that thee mercantile community 
is totally unable to be ring of 


there expenses and this you will 
perfectly understand by the state
musst which one *unclear* to forward to 
you.

Barwood the principal return 
cargo does not pay freight, this is 
easily seen, the present selling price 
in France being 75 to 85 francs at 
most per ton.

Ebony is but of shore* sale, after 
being kept a long time in warehouses 
and consequenity after heavy exposure .

India Rubber beemes daily searen ,
and even may be said to be 
disappearing entirdy besides this 
it sustains great lop of overnights,
it in river the lop the most important 
article.

Ivory is purchased at a *unclear*
rate here than in Europe, consequently 
the profit denied from it in my 
small, and consists only in the your 
made in lasting the goods.

Busway, this product is so scarce 
that it snag be considered *unclear*

To all this we have to add that 
living becomes harder daily, fresh 
provisions being wanting so to speak
moreover we *unclear* to otherwise 
than have your attention to the 
enormous lesser which wwe sustain 
by the frquent plundering of 
our boats, and this in spirit of 
your goal wise. As to the trust 
given to the natives, we will not
enlarge on that subject, and yet 
you an perfectly aware that those 
advances once made may be 
considered as therefourth last.

That circular also contained seward
articles relative to the keeping of our 
Books, on this head we will beg you 
to notice that in a country where one 
can remain but a short time, and 
is often ill, it is impossible to keep 
accounts as reguarly as in France.

In addition, profilin by this opportunity
we think that as ought to 
draw your attention to the fact,
that the formalities to be fulfilled.
because daily more complicates, 
thus we are obliged before commencing 
the unloading or leading 
of a vessel to obtain a permit at 
the cost of a franc. There appears 
to us the necessity for the existance 
of this permit in a country where
until now the authorities having 
nothing to gain thereby has never 
occupied itself with this kind of 
operation this measure occasioning 
some time a delay cannot 
but be prejudicial to us.

Hoping Monseiurs will be pleased 
to tkae into consideration the 
different observations which we 
have the honor to address to 
you and that in your high 
sease of Justice you will recognise 
the impossibility of 
insising upon the executive 
of the said circular of Sept 
21st and Nov 16th.

We have the honor to be 
Your most humble and 
Very obedient Servant.

Signed,
