<div2 type="chapter">

<head type="main">Chapter I. -- Slave Trade Countries. -- Measures to be Taken in Places of Origin.</head>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article I.</head>

<p>The Powers declare that the most effective means for counteracting
the Slave Tl·ade in the interior of Africa are the
following:</p>

<p>1. Progressive organization of the administrative, judicial,
religions, and military services in the African territories planed
under the sovereignty or Protectorate of civilized nations.</p>

<p>2. The gradual establishment in the interior by the responsible
rower in each territory of strongly occupied stations in such a way
as to make their protective or repressive action effectively felt in
the territories devastated by man-hunts.</p>

<p>3. The construction of roads, and in particular of railways,
connecting the advanced stations with the coast, and permitting
easy access to the inland waters and to the upper reaches of
streams and rivers which are broken by rapids and cataracts, so as
to substitute economical and speedy means of transport for the
present means of portage by men.</p>

<p>4. Establishment of steam-boats on the inland navigable
waters and on the lakes, supported by fortified posts established on
the banks.</p>

<p>5. Establishment of telegraphic lines assuring the communication
of the posts and stations with the coast and with the administrutive
centres.</p>

<p>6. Organization of expeditions and flying columns to keep up
the communication of the stations with each other and with the
coast, to support repressive action, and to a!;sure the security of
roadways.</p>

<p>7. Restriction of the importation of fire-anus, at least of modern
pattern, and of ammunition, throughout the en*e extent of the
territories infected by the Slave Trade.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article II.</head>

<p>The stations, the cruisers organized by each Power in its inland
waters, and the posts which serve as ports for them, shall, independently
of their principal task, which is to prevent the capture
of slaves and intercept the routes of the Slave Trade, have the
following subsidiary duties:</p>

<p>1. To serve as a base, and, if necessary, as a place of refuge, for
the native populations placed under the sovereignty or the Protectorate
of the State to which the station belongs, for the independent
populations, and temporarily for all others in case of
imminent danger; to place the populations of the first of these
categories in a position to co-operate for their own defence; to
diminish intestine wars between tribes by means of arbitration; to
initiate them in agricultural works and in the industrial arts so as
to increase their welfare; to raise them to civilization and bring
about the extinction of barbarous customs, such as cannibalism and
human sacrifices.</p>

<p>2. To give aid and protection to commercial undertakings, to
watch over their legality, especially by controlling contracts of
service with natives, and to lead up to the foundation of permanent
centres of cultivation and of commercial establishments.</p>

<p>3. To protect, without distinction of creed, the Missions which
are already or may hereafter be established.</p>

<p>4. To provide for the sanitary service, and to grant hospitality
and help to explorers, and to all who take part in Africa in
the work of repressing the Slave Trade.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article III.</head>

<p>The Powers exercising sovereignty or Protectorate in Africa, in
order to confirm and give greater precision to their former declarations,
undertake to proceed gradually, as circumstances permit.
either by the means above indicated or by any other means which
they may consider suitable, with the repression of the Slave Trade;
each State in its respective possessions and under its own direction.
Whenever they consider it possible they will lend their
good offices to the Powera which, with a perfectly humanitarian
object, may be engaged in Africa upon a similar mission.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article IV.</head>

<p>The Powers exercising sovereignty or Protectorate in Africa
may, however, delegate to Chartered Companies all or a portion of
the engagements which they assume in virtue of Article III. They
remain, nevertheless, directly responsible for the engagements
which they contract by the present General Act, and guarantee the
execution thereof.</p>

<p>The Powers promise to receive, aid, and protect national Associations
and enterprises due to private initiative which may wish
to co-operate in their possessions in the repression of the Slave
Trade, subject to their receiving previous authorization, which is
revocable at any time; subject also to their being directed and
controlled, and to the exclusion of any exercise of rights of sovereignty.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article V.</head>

<p>The Contracting Powers undertake, unless this has already
been provided for by laws in accordance with the spirit of the
present Article, to enact or propose to their respective Legislatures,
in the course of one year at latest from the date of the signature
of the present General Act, a Law applying, on the one hand,
the provisions of their penal laws concerning grave offences against
the person, to the organizers and abettors of man-hunts, to perpetrators
of the mutilation of adults and male infants, and to all
persons who may take part in the capture of slaves by violence;
and, on the other hand, the provisions relating to offences against
individual liberty, to carriers, transporters, and dealers in slaves.</p>

<p>Accomplices and accessories of the different categories of 8la~e
captors and dealers above specified shall be punished with penalties
proportionate to those incurred by the principals.</p>

<p>Guilty persons who may have escaped from the jurisdiction of
the authorities of the country where the crimes or offences. have
been committed shall be arrested either on communication of the
incriminatory evidence by the authorities who have ascertained
the violation of the law, or on production of any other proof of
guilt by the Power on whose territory they may have been
discovered, and shall, without other formality, be held at the
disposal of the Tribunals competent to try them.</p>

<p>The Powers will communicate to each other, with the least
possible delay, the Laws or Decrees already in existence or promulgated
in execution of the present Article.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article VI.</head>

<p>Slaves liberated in consequence of the stoppage or dispersal of
a convoy in the interior of the continent, shall be sent back, if
circumstances permit, to their country of origin; if not, the local
authorities shall help them as much as possible to obtain means of
subsistence, and, if they desire it, to settle on the spot.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article VII.</head>

<p>Any fugitive slave claiming on the continent the protection of
the Signatory Powers shall obtain it, and shall be received in the
camps and stations officially established by them, or on board
Government vessels plying on the lakes and rivers. Private stations
and vessels are only permitted to exercise the right of asylum subject
to the previous sanction of the State.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article VIII.</head>

<p>The experience of all nations who have intercourse with Africa,
having shown the pernicious and preponderating part played by
fire-arms in Slave Trade operations, as well as in intestine wars
between native tribes; and this same experience having clearly
proved that the preservation of the African populations, whose
existence it is the express wish of the Powers to safeguard, is a
radical impossibility if restrictive measures against the trade in
fire-arms and ammunition are not established; the Powers decide,
in so far as the present state of their frontiers permits, that the
importation of fire-arms, and especially of rifles and improved
weapons, as well as of powder, balls, and cartridges, is, except in
the cases and under the conditions provided for in the following
Article, prohibited in the territories compriised between the
20th parallel of north latitude and the 22nd parallel of south
latitude, and extending westward to the Atlantic Ocean, and
eastward to the Indian Ocean and its dependencies, comprising
the islands adjacent to the coast as far as 100 nautical miles from
the shore.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article IX.</head>

<p>The introduction of' fire-arms and ammunition, when there
shall be occasion to authorize it in the possessions of the Signatory
Powers which exercise rights of sovereignty or of Protectorate in
Africa, shall be regulated in the following manner in the zone laid
down in Article VIII, unless identical or more rigorous Regulations
have been already applied:</p>

<p>All imported fire-arms shall be deposited, at the cost, risk, and
peril of the importers, in a public warehouse placed under the
control of the Administration of the State. No withdrawal of
fire-arms or imported ammunition shall take place from such warehouses
without the previous authorization of the Administration.
This authorization shall, except in cases hereinafter specified, be
refused for the withdrawal of all arms of precision, such as rifles,
magazine guns, or breech-loaders, whether whole or in detached
pieces, their cartridges, caps, or other ammunition intended for
them.</p>

<p>At the sea-ports the respective Governments may permit the
establishment of private warehouses, under conditions affording
the needful guarantees; but only for ordinary powder and flintlock
guns, and to the exclusion of improved arms and their ammunition.</p>

<p>Besides the measures directly taken by Governments for the
arming of the public force and the organization of their defence,
individual exceptions shall be admitted for persons affording sufficient
guarantees that the arm and ammunition delivered to them will
not be given, assigned, or sold to third persons, and for travellers
provided with a declaration of their Government stating that the
weapon and ammunition are destined exclusively for their personal
defence.</p>

<p>In the cases provided for in the preceding paragraph, all
arms shall be registered and marked by the authorities appointed
for the control, who shall deliver to the persons in question
licences to bear arms, indicating the name of the bearer and showing
the stamp with which the arm is marked. These licences are revocable
in case of proved abuse, and will be issued for five years
only, but may be renewed.</p>

<p>The rule above set forth as to warehousing shall also apply to
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Only flint-lock unrifled guns and common gunpowder, called
trade powder ("poudres de traite"), can be withdrawn from the
warehouses for purposes of sale. At each withdrawal of arms and
ammunition of this kind for sale, the local authorities shall determine
the regions in which these arms and ammunition may be sold.
The regions infected by the Slave Trade shall always be excluded.
Persons authorized to take arms or powder out of the warehouses
shall present to the Administration every six months detailed
lists indicating the destinations of the said fire-arms and powder
sold, as well as the quantities still remaining in store.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article X.</head>

<p>The Governments shall take all measures they may deem
necessary to insure as complete a fulfilment as possible of the
provisions respecting the importation, sale, and transport of firearms
and ammunition, as well as to prevent either the entry or exit
thereof by their inland irontiers, or the conveyance thereof to regions
where the Slave Trade exists.</p>

<p>The authorization of transit within the limits of the zone
specified by Article VIII cannot be withheld when the arms and
ammunition are to pass across the territory of a Siguatory or adherent
Power in the occupation of the coast, towards inland territories
placed under the sovereignty or Protectorate of another
Signatory or adherent Power, unless this latter Power have direct
access to the sea through its own territory. Nor, if this access be
completely interrupted, can the authorization of transit be withheld.
Any demand for transit must be accompanied by a declaration
emanating from the Government of the Power having the
inland possessions, and certifying that the said anus and ammunition
are not destined for sale, but are for the use of the authorities
of such Power, or of the military forces necessary for the protection
of the missionary or commercial stations, or of persons mentioned
by name in the Declaration. Nevertheless, the territorial Power
of the coast retains the right to stop, exceptionally and provisionally,
the transit of arm of precision and ammunition across its territory,
if, in consequence of inland disturbances or other serious danger,
there is ground for fearing that the dispatch of arms and ammunition
might compromise its own safety.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article XI.</head>

<p>The Powers shall communicate to each other information
relating to the traffic in fire-arms and ammunition, the licences
granted, and the measures of repression in force in their respective
territories.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article XII.</head>

<p>The Powers undertake to adopt or to propose to their respective
Legis1atures the measures necessary to insure that those who infringe
the prohibitions laid down in Articles VIII and IX, and
their accomplices, shall, besides the seizure and confiscation of the
prohibited arms and ammunition, be punished either by fine or by
imprisonment, or by both penalties together, in proportion to the
importance of the offence, and in accordance with the gravity of
each case.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article XIII.</head>

<p>The Signatory Powers who have possessions in Africa in contact
with the zone specified in Article VIII, bind themselves to take
the necessary measures for preventing the introduction of firearms
and ammunition across their inland frontiers into the regions
of the said zone, at least that of improved arms and cartridges.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article XIV.</head>

<p>The system established under Articles VIII to XIII inclusive,
shall remain in force for twelve years. In case none of the Contracting
Parties shall have notified, twelve months before the expitation
of this period, their intention of putting an end to it, nor
shall have demanded its revision, it shall continue to remain oblgatory
for two more years, and shall thus continue in force from two
years to two years.</p>

they exercise in the centres of the Slave Trade, the stations, cruisers,
and posts, the establishment of which is provided for in Article II,
and all other stations established or recognized according to the
terms of Article IV hy each Government in its possessions, will
furthermore have the mission of watching, so far as circumstances
permit, and in proportion to the progress of their administrative
organization, the routes on their territory followed by the slavedealers,
of stopping the convoys ou the march, and of pursuing
them wherever they can legally take action.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article XVI.</head>

<p>In the regions of the coast known to serve habitually as places
of passage or terminal points for 8lave Traffic coming from the
interior, as well as at the points of intersection of the principal
caravan routes crossing the zone contiguous to the coast already
subject to the influence of the Sovereign or Protecting Powers,
posts shall be established, under the conditions and with the
reservations mentioned in Article III, by the authorities responsible
for such territories, with the purpose of intercepting the
convoys and liberating the slaves.</p>

</div3>

<div3 type="article">

<head type="sub">Article XVII.</head>

<p>A strict supervision shall be organized by the local authorities
at the ports and in the countries adjacent to the coast, with the
view of preventing the sale and shipment of slaves brought from
the interior, as well as the formation and departure for the interior
of bands of man-hunters and slave-dealers.</p>

<p>Caravans arriving at the coast or its vicinity, as well as those
arriving in the interior at a locality occupied by the authorities of

<head type="main">Declaration.</head>

<p>The Powers assembled in Conference at Brussels, who have
ratified the General Act of Berlin of the 26th February, 1885, or
who have acceded thereto,</p>

<p>After having drawn up and signed in concert, in the General
Act of this day, a collection of measures intended to put an end
to the negro Slave Trade by land as well as by sea, and to improve
the moral and material conditions of existence of the native
races.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration that the execution of the provisions
which they have adopted with this object imposes on some of them
who have possessions or Protectorates in the conventional basin
of the Congo obligations which absolutely demand new resources
to meet them.</p>

<p>Have agreed to make the following Declaration:</p>

<p>The Signatory or adhering Powers who have possessions or
Protectorates in the said conventional basin of the Congo are
authorized, so far as they require any authority for the purpose,
to establish therein duties upon imported goods, the scale of which
shall not exceed a rate equivalent to 10 per cent. ad valorem at
the port of entry, always excepting spirituous liquors, which are
regulated by the provisions of Chapter VI of the General Act of
this day.</p>

<p>After the signature of the said General Act negotiations shall
be opened between the Powers who have ratified the General Act
of Berlin, or who have adhered to it, in order to draw up, within
the maximum limit of 10 per cent. ad valorem, the conditions of
the Customs system to be established in the conventional basin of
the Congo.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is understood:</p>

<p>1. That no differential treatment or transit duty shall be
established;</p>

<p>2. That in applying the Customs system which may be agreed
upon, each Power will undertake to simplify formalities as much
as possible, and to facilitate trade operations;</p>

<p>3. That the arrangement resulting from the proposed negotiations
shall remain in force for fifteen years from the signature of
the present Declaration.</p>

<p>At the expiration of this period, and failing a fresh Agreement,
the Contracting Powers shall return to the conditions provided for
by Article IV of the General Act of Berlin, retaining the power
of imposing duties up to a maximum of 10 per cent. upon goods
imported into the conventional basin of the Congo.</p>

<p>The ratifications of the present Declaration shall be exchanged
at the same time as those of the General Act of this
day.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have
drawn up the present Declaration, and have affixed thereto their
seals.</p>

<p>Done at Brussels, the 2nd day of the month of July, 1890.</p>
