<p>No 88... US Consulate Goree Dakar
March 30th 1886

To the Honorable
James D Porter
Assitant Secretary of State


Sir,
In reply to your request
relating to Returns of unofficial
fees I have to explain that none
whatever have been received at
this Consulate sinceit was
established and I have not
had imporessed on my mind
that I ought to have mentioned
the fact in some of my Dispatches
Begging your pardon for the 
oversight I shall try and bear
in mind that such negative
reports are needed in the future.</p>
    
<p>In this connection it 
may not be using to <unclear/> 
that this Consulate cannot
be kept and all the regulations</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_135919"/>

<p>of the Government complied
with beyond critism on the 
meagre salary afforded by "Fees"
without pecuniary loss to the 
incumbent. It is undoubtedly
an honor to represent the United
States abroad, but if I divine
right Consulates in newly--
developed countries when
our commerce ought to less
expanded do not exist
solely for the sake of honoring
people, and every hardy prince
is not a Didius Luliarners"
that he can afford to buy
such an expansive luxury.</p>
    
<p>Pardon me for suggesting that
I believe the whole fee septom
is one colouslated to weaken
the mural would approve of anything 
to gain the convienance of 
a consular office on some 
paint they wished to carry</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_135927"/>  
    
<p>and have fees for pretended
devices multipied almost 
indefinately is incease his
demand against the Government.
Seven hunded dollars without 
fees, and a right to do business,
is as small a sum as would
support a Consulate here even 
respectably, and I hope some 
action will speedily be taken
to put it on such a basis.</p>
    
<p>By employing a clerk for 
other business enough time
might them be given the
consulate to have mistakes
in conducting its business
more generally avoided
and reports could them be 
got up which might 
be of great value to our 
citizens. Senegal in a new 
country with abundant 
capabilities for supporting 
a very large commerce it
Goree-Dakar with its</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_135932"/>
<p>excellent commercial
telegraphies and model facilities 
is the commerical centre
and will probably soon
be the Capital; but of
about ten thousand tons of 
Shipping now in the harder
only four hundred are american,
and that is much greater
than the average proportion:
Under such circumstances can 
it be were for the United 
States to attempt keeping
a compotent Officer here
whose salary is insufficient 
25 allow him to keep swelle
posted on the denial past 
of his duties.

I am esteemed for 
Your obident Servant 
Peter Strickland
US Consul</p>
