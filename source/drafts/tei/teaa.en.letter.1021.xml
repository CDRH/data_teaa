<p>United States Consular
Agency at Elmina<lb/>
Dec. 20, 1886</p>

<p>Hon. Saml. S. Sevier<lb/>
United States Vice Consul<lb/>
Monrovia Liberia.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your
despatch dated Monrovia
Oct. 27/86, with the
enclosed copy of a despatch
No. 224 from the Department
of State written by the Vice
Consul Gen. of Sierra Leone
making complaints against
me. The above arrived
on 19th inst. In reply
<catchwords>I</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1088.jpg"/>

I beg to say–</p>

<p>1st That Jacob Smith was
one of the crew of the brig Giles
Loring of Portland Me. Geo.
Klose master. the vessel
arrived here in distress,
being in a leaky condition.</p>

<p>2d That men from ashore
were put on board to keep
the pumps going and the 
ships crew to look after ship
and cargo whilst the
ship was lightened to discover 
the leak if possible.</p>

<p>3rd That said Jacob Smith
run away during the night
and stopped on shore for
several days and nights
after the report of the master

<pb n="Roll5-1089.jpg"/>

to this Consulate I send in
search of said Jacob Smith.</p>

<p>4th That he was found in a 
disorderly condition in the
Street and the Police brought
him to this Consulate.</p>

<p>I ordered him to go on board
the ship and found a canoe
to take him on board.</p>

<p>5th That when he got to the
beach or <sic>warf</sic> he refused
to go off and after making
some trouble the Police
locked him up.</p>

<p>6th That the next day he was
brought to this Consulate
I  tried my best to explain 
to him that he better go on
board the ship and attend
<catchwords>his</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1091.jpg"/>

his work and that as soon
as the ship was found to be
unseaworthy they all would
be paid off and sent home
but if he did not do so he
will be taken as a deserter
this was in presence of
the master; he still refused
to go on board the vessel,
saying he had found some
of his relations here and
he is not an American
and does not intend to
go to the ship again nor
to Boston and I had
nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>7th That it was found
out that the said Jacob
Smith had smuggled

<pb n="Roll5-1092.jpg"/>

his personal property on
shore long ago.</p>

<p>8th That after he had told
me he was not an
American subject and had
nothing to do with United
States Consulate I did not
trouble myself any more
about him.</p>

<p>9th That he Jacob Smith
enlisted himself with
the British Government out
here.</p>

<p>10th That after some months
he employed a Lawyer
to sue the Captain for
his wages. the Lawyer
finding it was a bad case
and that he Jacob Smith
did

<pb n="Roll5-1093.jpg"/>

did not tell him the truth
gave it up.</p>

<p>Hoping the above explanation
will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
G. E. Eminsang<lb/>
U.S. Consular Agent.</p>
