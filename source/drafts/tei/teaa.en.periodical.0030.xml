<p>MEN WHO ARE KNOWN.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>-Editor T. Thomas Fortune went through Texas, and pro-
nounced it the most progressive state in the South. It is very
evident that he did not stop in North Carolina.
- Bishop H. M. Turner has returned from his third annual
trip to Africa to hold the Conference there, and is as confirmed
in his contention that Africa is the place for the Negro as ever.
- Congressman G. W. Murray was a delegate at the Conven-
tion of Republican League clubs, and made an excellent impres-
sion by his manly bearing and his intelligent way of expressing
his views.
- "Our" H. C. Smith of the Cleveland Gasette, did nobly in 
looking after the interests of the colored delegates during the
great Republican Convention held in his wonderful city. His
hospitality was unbounded, and none of us can ever forget him.
- Rev. Mr. Gumb, who is doing missionary work for Zion
Church in San Domingo, has succeeded in erecting a splendid
church there, and is in America soliciting funds to aid in erect-
ing other churches.
- Rev. Jehu Holliday, D.D., the Book Steward of Zion
Church, is meeting with marvellous success handling the great
history of A.M.E. Zion Church, by Bishop Hood. He will
soon dispose of the entire first edition.
- Editor John C. Dancy made a ringing speech at the
National Convention of Republican League Clubs, held at Cleve-
land, recently, and was elected one of the Vice Presidents of the
great gathering. The banquet given the delegates was the most
unique and elaborate ever before tendered the body.
- Rev. F.A. Clinton can stir up as much enthusiasm as any
man in the range of our acquaintance. He is a bright orator, a
whirlwind when in action, and is always sure to arouse his hear-
ers to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. No man in Pittsburg is
more popular than he. He will remain in that city to continue
his good work.</p>
