Honorable John Davis, Assistant 
Secretary of State:

Sir,

I now report my 
arrival at my station Oct. 22nd
1884 and my entry upon the duties 
of the office at that date. I found 
everything pertaining to the office 
had been carefully cared for by Rev.
A.C. Good who was appointed to C.A.
but who owing to certain aspect
changes in our mission thought it 
not best to qualify as he might not 
be able to attend to the duties of the office.
There has therefore been no 
official duties performed and the 
regular reports have not been sent 

<p></p>I have made an official 
call upon the Commandant and 
have *unclear lines8

gather 
<pb facs="20170615_145443"
gather some forms regarding the 
policy of France in this Agency.

<p></p>The present Commandant so 
friendly, personally, but insists upon 
the last being explored even while 
he presses expert that such lawd 
have been passed.

<p></p>Bonita a distresal fourth 
Gaboon where are mission has been 
laboring nearly thirty years with mor
sucess has lately been slammed both 
by the German and the French, the 
negatives *unclear* at Germans. The 
Commandant here has recounted orders
from France to store the mission 
even before the claim of our business 
is allowed.

<p></p>The French have wished to get 
posession of Consec Island never 
belonging to Spain, where our mission 
has been established for nearly forty 
years and the Commandant wrote to 
the people asking them to form the 
triangle from Spain + France. The 
people met and passed them

<pb facs="20170615_145449" 

<p>wishes by letter written by one of our</p>
native preachers, Rev. EBEA L. KING a native 
of Corises, in language more favorable
than elegant and now the Commandant 
threatens to arrest and imprison
him if he enters the Colony of Gaboon,
He however expects to attend our nesting
of Presbytert in Jan. end.

<p>Towards the people here they are acting so as
gradually to divest them of all power
necessairly using very arbitrary measures 
and rejoicing that they are able to show the
people that resistance is useless.</p>
    
<p>I feel that the next few years 
is going to decide the question, whether
France is to be allowed to impose her
unjust laws and arbitary restrictions 
upon a large pair of tropical Africa,
or not; and I could wish that the 
voice of our own government might 
be heard protesting effectively in behalf
of this down hidden people.</p>

<pb facs="20170615_145458"
 
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of a cope of an act making 
appropritations for the consular and 
Diplomatic service of the government for 
the fiscal year ending June thirteth
eighteen hundred and slightly five, and 
for other purposes.</p>
    
<p>I <unclear>bans</unclear>here with reports
No. 10 for Quarterly ending 
June 3rd, 1883 and Nov.105 for fiscal
years ending repeating June 30th, 1883+1884.
I remain Sir,</p>
    
Your obident servant
Graham C. Campbell
U.S.C.A
