Honorable John Davis, Assistant 
Secretary of State:

Sir,

I now report my 
arrival at my station Oct. 22nd
1884 and my entry upon the duties 
of the office at that date. I found 
everything pertaining to the office 
had been carefully cared for by Rev.
A.C. Good who was appointed to C.A.
but who owing to certain aspect
changes in our mission thought it 
not best to qualify as he might not 
be able to attend to the duties of the office.
There has therefore been no 
official duties performed and the 
regular reports have not been sent 

I have made an official 
call upon the Commandant and 
have *unclear lines8

gather 

gather some forms regarding the 
policy of France in this Agency.

The present Commandant so 
friendly, personally, but insists upon 
the last being explored even while 
he presses expert that such lawd 
have been passed.

Bonita a distresal fourth 
Gaboon where are mission has been 
laboring nearly thirty years with mor
sucess has lately been slammed both 
by the German and the French, the 
negatives *unclear* at Germans. The 
Commandant here has recounted orders
from France to store the mission 
even before the claim of our business 
is allowed.

The French have wished to get 
posession of Consec Island never 
belonging to Spain, where our mission 
has been established for nearly forty 
years and the Commandant wrote to 
the people asking them to form the 
triangle from Spain + France. The 
people met and passed them

*unclear* better
