<p>Lords Discuss the Congo.</p>

<p>Archbishop Calls it a Most Disheartening Question.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>London, July 29. -- "The system of government in the <placeName key="con" n="mapped"><country type="colony">Congo Independent State</country></placeName> is one of unrestrained tyranny, enforced by the lash and the bullet, by cruelty and by murder." This was the declaration of Lord Monkswell, who raised the Congo question in the House of Lords to-day and moved for the papers. The attendance in the House was small.</p>

<p>Continuing, Lord Monkswell said the Congo Government was a powerful engine of greed, which impudently and insolently violated the limitations and restrictions under which its rights over the territory had been granted.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury declared that the Congo was one of the most disheartening and humiliating of contemporary questions. He said it was ghastly irony to read to-day the words of the address presented to King Leopold by the City of London in 1884, congratulating his Majesty upon his "bloodless victory."</p>

<p>A general debate on the Congo question followed. A number of Bishops were among the speakers.</p>

<p>Lord Fitzmaurice, Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, said the Government had asked the Congo State not to disregard the experiences of previous Governments of native states. The present system was certain to have evil consequences. Yet it was an international question, and if the House took any sudden, rash action it would run the risk of injuring the cause.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of Lord Fitzmaurice's address Lord Monkswell withdrew his motion.</p>
