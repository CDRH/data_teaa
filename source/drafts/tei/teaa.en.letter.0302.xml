I would most respectfully call
your attention to the enclosed copy 
of a letter from the Rev.R.H.Nassan
American Missionary at Coises.

The statements there in an unfortunately 
but too tone. No less than two 
weeks ago a ship load of negroes,
was smuggled from the neighborhood of 
Rama (a village some fifty or
sixty miles distant) to Princes island,
and I find on inquiry that similar
transactions on of monthly, if not 
of weekly occurence.

I was also informed but yesterday,
by Henry A. Boardman, a trader,
long established at this place, and 
who has for years supplied the 
American vessels with barkwood, ivory,
ebony, + that two of his boats had
]been plundered of a valuable cargo,
while on a trading voyage up the 

come

come, and that on a former occasions
when he had suffered a considerable 
loss from the departures of the natives,
that his representations, had 
not been listened to, by the French 
authorities to whom he had applied
for <unclear>

This Sir, and those mentioned by 
the Rev. R.H.Nassan, on but a fear
of the many instances which have 
occured when American citizens have 
either been punished or maltreated 
without the power of obtaining
vessels.

I would also call your attention 
to my late despatch of the 17th
>unclear> in reference to the diffculties 
of the American Bante Roebuck in 
which instance an American man 
of war would have been most 
desirable. Independent of these facts,

I believe, and it is the opinion of 
the missionaries and other American 
citizens residing on the coast 
that the presence of an American 
manifest war would be very 
desirable that it would be beneficial to 
then and add to the dignity 
of the nature. 

Treaing that this despatched will
need with a favorable receptoire

I have the honor to be 
Very Respectfully 
your obdient servt
Augustus Peret 
U.S. Cont. Agent
