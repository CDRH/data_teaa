<p>The Congo Controversy.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>The Belgian Government undoubtedly
regards the persistent attacks upon the
administration of the <placeName key="con" n="mapped"><country type="colony">Congo Free State</country></placeName>
as calling for defense. What we must
assume to be an official attempt to meet
some of these charges is contained in a.
book of some 200 pages, printed at Brussels.
It is called "The Truth About the
Civilization in Congo1and," and sets forth
with evident care and abundant elaboration
the history of the efforts that have
been made, under the direction of the
Sovereign King, Leopold II., to secure
humane and civilizing treatment of the
native population, the establishment of
courts and the administration of justice,
the extirpation of slavery and the Arabian
slave trade, the abolition of barbarous
native customs, the regulation of the
alcoholic liquor traffic, the establishment
of the "force publique," or national
army, the improvement of the material
and moral conditions of the people, and
the organization of the Government to
carry out the purposes declared in the
establishment of the Congo Free State.</p>

<p>It does not appear to be disputed by
temperate critics of the conditions described
as evil that are now and for
some years have been complained of as
having flourished in the Congo, that the
people of that part of Africa are in many
respects better off than they were when
Leopold II. became their sovereign,
with the approval of the leading Powers.
There is general agreement of testimony
to the fact that the Arabian slave traders
have been driven from the country, and
for that reason there has been a cessation
of much brutal waste of life. With
this dreadful incubus lifted from the
land, the natives undoubtedly cheerfully
joined the army maintained in part by
their liberators to prevent any attempt to
revive the hated slave traffic, and met
the Congo officials in a spirit of confidence.
The courts have to a limited extent
strengthened the inclination of the
natives to regard the crown officers as
their friends. There Is not much doubt
that the "poison test" bas been discouraged
within the jurisdiction of the State
agents, that cannibalism bas been prevented
in the settlements under Belgian
supervision, and that the condition of the
people must be said to have undergone a
vast change for the better as a result of
the struggle under Leopold II. to overcome
the dreadful customs and primitive
barbarity that afflicted the country
when it passed from African to Belgian
control.</p>

<p>But what we accept as an official
statement regarding the success of Belgian
control in the Congo Free State disappoints
us when we seek in it reply to
the accusations contained in the pamphlet
of Mr. Morel on "The Congo
Stave State." There is not a word in
the Belgian defense to explain or discredit
the charge that the "Domaine
Prive," which is practically all of the
Congo, has been turned over to the Katanga.
Company, the Mongalla Company,
the Lopori-Maringa Company, the Kasal
Company, and several other. organizations
that are called "trusts" by their
critics, and that the Government of the
Congo Free State is a majority stockholder
in each of these companies to exploit
concessions. According to such evidence
as has been secured by Mr. Morel,
the profits of these companies have been
enormous. But to get them, in a country
without currency, where all the land
and. its products are claimed by the
crown, and where the taxes are collectible
and must be collected "in kind" out
of the people, the holders of the concessions,
straining every nerve to gratify
the royal and merchant shareholders,
have appeared to lose sight of the ideals
set up in the earlier proclamations of the
Sovereign King, and with the help of
the native army have subjected the 
inhabitants, just relieved of fear of the
Arabian slave trader, to a new slavery
enforced with the sanction of the Government.</p>

<p>These are complaints susceptible of
explanation. Their gravity must speedily
lead to a denunciation of the abuses they
disclose, if they exist, and a remedy at
the hands of the Government as soon as
may be. We have acknowledged that
we believe it possible that French, 
English, and German rivalry for the trade or
the Congo has inspired some of the hostility
recently displayed toward Leopold
II., but there is still the presumption that
we cannot avoid entertaining, that a
spirit of cruel commercialism bas crept
in where ten years ago there was only a
worthy ambition to introduce the light
of civilization to "Darkest Africa."</p>
