<p>Sierra Leone District
Yearly Report
Henry Rider</p>
   
<p>Consular Agent
Freeform the port of entry for the Colony
of Sierra Leone West Africa, lies in 1842
N. and <unclear/> 13 14' /8. It is a place of some 
note and has been burned the metropolis oof 
this particular part of the coast. The port 
contains some six or seven thousand inhab
-itants and the census taken before the late
epidemic returns nearly forty thousand 
people in the colony. The exports of the place
are ground nuts, hides, palm oil, camwood,
<unclear/>, palm kernels, beeswax, ivory and
native gold. Ground nuts and <unclear/>
find their principal market in France and 
are almost wholy shipped in French bottoms,
palm oil, palm kernels, and bees-wax, are
also shipped to France but in smaller
quantities. Palm-oil and hides are the 
principal exports to the United States, besides
which small quantities of groundnut,
camwood and ivory are occasionally
shipped, these freight are confined to</p>

<p>to American vessels. England presents a
market for all the exports of the colony in a quart-
er or less degree. The imports are Tobacco in
hogshead, rum, provisions, and a few dry
goods, from the United States, dry goods and
provisions of every description from England
dry goods, mints, and liquors, from France.
The port does not present a flourishing cena-
-dition, on the contray a stranger is im-
pressed with the streets are grass-grown with
but little havel through them and there are 
dilapidated houses, and lots overrun with 
weeds to be met with at every step; the black
population, with some exceptions, are very
poor and inactive, preferring to remain about 
town earning perhaps enough for a single
meal, to living in the village and cultiva-
ting the land, which with a moderate amount 
of labor would remumerate them kandsomely;
the exceptions are generally liberated Africans,
who by strict economy and much shrewdness
have accumalted money and are, with the 
few Europeans, the business men of the place,
the apathy before spoken of horroer, is entirely</p>

<p>enitrely confined to apperance, for the commer-
cial interests of the place are of considerable
importance, the reverence have increased steadily 
for some years past <unclear/> a corresponding 
increase in the commerce of the colony, the a-
mount of business done with United States
is not inconsiderable as the following returns
for 1859 wil show

<p>Total of American importations $20,209.14.1
.    "   "   0/0 . exportations $50,202.17.
The returns for 1860 I have not been able to 
obtain.</p>

important than that of the United States, and</p>
