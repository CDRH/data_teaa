<p>No 115-G.I.
Coquilhatville, October 15, 1907.
ANNEX OF LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR GENERAL 
FROM 4 9NO SPECIAL</p>

<p>Mr. Governor General,</p>

<p>In response to your telegram recalled here,  
I have the honor to carry to your knowledge that having 
been informed by Lépoldville of the passage of the Consulate General 
of the United States, I believe the Government was told of this 
movement. What is more, while passing the first 
time, Mr. Smith did not land, expressed regrets in
not meeting the Commissioner of the absent 
district, as no incident of any type had risen,
I attached no importance of character to this
visit worth communication to the Government. Before
leaving, Mr. Smith had said that he counts my return 
during the voyage, we had concluded that he rose 
in the Maringa-Lopori zone where he had not further 
penetrated.</p>

<p>It was only October 12, during your jouney home, that
I learned that he had been in the Bangala district. 
This time he had rested in Coquilhatville about one 
and a half hours. He was informed of the rising performances
in the district. The roles of the performances had no
condfidential character, I believed the necessity in giving him the 
details asked for.</p>

<p>Consul General told me, by informing of the truthfulness
of the complaint, that the Lulonga natives had signaled to
him the exaggeration of the performance in  l'exagération des prestations en poisson
required of them. Yet, the natives were not commanded that for
900 grams of smoked fish a month. They had confirmed
that the imposition was weekly. I denied 
this simply by reporting to the sheets of </p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Mr. Smith had not dreamed of examining the dates of payment.
This complaint cannot be made from missionary Gilchrist of Lulonga's 
instigation.</p>

<p>Incidently, in the course of the very cordial  
conversation between us, he informed me that in the vicinity 
of Upoto, I believe, he had himself been doing rubber
harvests. My impression is that he finds exaggerated 
quantity of 3 kilos demanded every month from  
taxpayers.</p>

<p>Mr. Smit, accompanied by Vice Consul, traveling aboard 
the "Henry Reed" from the  A.B.M.U."</p>

<p>I see nothing else to signal regarding the passage 
of these diplomatic agents.</p>

<p>District Commissioner,
(s) Bertrand.</p>
