<p>Subject.
A reply to your Consular
despatch No. 32, Mar. 12, 1901</p>

<p>No. 67. Consular.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia;
April 15, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt
April 14, 1901, of your No. 32,
"Consular," of March 12, 1901, in
which I am reprimanded for
the very irregular manner
and careless way in which
the Secretary of this Legation
acknowledged the receipt of
official publications &amp;c sent to
this Legation.</p>

<p>In reply, I have to say, I
have often directed the Secretary
to acknowledge the receipt of
official publications sent to this
Consulate Genral; whenever,
he</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4003.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>he has reported the receipt of
such to me; but have never
directed him, knowing it, to
be such, to acknowledge the
receipt of any Diplomatic publication;
the which I have been
very careful to acknowledge
myself. I exceedingly, regret
that such errors and irregularities
have served in this office.
The preparation of his despatches,
is such and other cases
touching the business of the
Legation are never presented
to me for my approved; and
I am sorry to have to say,
that I am usually entirely
ignorant of the contents thereof.
If the Secretary of the Legation,
was in reality a subordinate
officer, in feelings; and not as
he feels himself to be, my official
equal and associate; coming
in at will, and going out at
pleasure; not being accountable
to</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4004.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>to me; writing, publishing and
sending forth any matter that
he sees fit to write or publish,
without consulting me; I
would have a remedy, otherwise,
I am powerless to
prevent such errors, unless
I do the entire work myself.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith,
Consul General.</p>
