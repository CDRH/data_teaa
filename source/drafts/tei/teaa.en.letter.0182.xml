<p>Legation of the Republic of Liberia,
               Yonkers, N.Y.
               March 22nd, 1866</p>

<p> I see by the newspapaers that a Resolution
   has been offered in the House of Reperesentatives
   of the U.,S. "to discontinue an arrangement made
   with Great Britain to keep a naval force on the
   coast of Africa on the assumption that the
   slave trade has now ceased.</p>

<p> I have before me two tellers from Liberia
   recently received, one from W.J. Anderson dated
   5th of Jany 1866 giving an account of a jourmey
   made last year about ninety miles (in a straight
   line) interiorward from Monrovia in whcih he 
   says he found the native joins barricaded against
   wars which were there prevailing the sole object
   of which was the capture of men, women and
   children; the other from President Warner wa
   ging me to endeavor to <unclear/> by purchase on a <unclear/> or
    otherwise from the United States govenrment a
   small gun steam <unclear/> of not over one hun
   dred twenty tons and internally that the 
   slave trade has not yet been suppressed by</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0182.002"/>

<p>within the lines of the Liberian Coast by the forces
   employed by America and England, but 
   would be, if Liberia had such small vessel.</p>

<p> I beg leave to recall to your notice a part
   of the note which i had the honor to address
   to you on the 1st of Nov. last as follows.</p>

<p> "You are aware that hte late and lamented
   President Lincoln recommended to Congress to sell
   a small gun boat to Liberia; i have been inf
   -ed that a bill to do so was passed by one <unclear/>
   but that Congress adjourned before action on it
   was had in the other.</p>

<p>  The United States having been at great <unclear/>
   in maintaining vessels on the coast of Africa, to
   suppress the slave trade, permit me to ask (<unclear/>
   consideration of the fact that the use of a small
   boat by the government of Liberia would <unclear/>
   them more easily to keep 500 miles of the <unclear/>
   entirely free from that trade) whether the United
   States could consistently lend, until by act of
   Congress it could sell to Liberia on a credit, a <unclear/>
   gun boat of about one hundred tons, and there
   promote one of its own cherished objects to
   gret an extent, at so much smaller cost</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0182.003"/>

<p>can be effected in any other manner"
    Herewith please receive the late message
   of the President of Liberia; in it is mentioned 
   a trety made with Portugal assimilitating the
   slave trade to piracy.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be, with
   the highest consideration Sir your
   most obedient servant
                Hm., Scheiffelir</p>
<p>Hon. Wm. H. Seward
   Secretary of State
        Washington D.C.</p>
