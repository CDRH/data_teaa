<p>Department of State
    Monrovia February 19th 1883</p>

<p>Sir
       I had athe honor to forward you a dispatch last year, asking
   the consideration of the government of the United States of
   America to several matters in connection with the welfare and
   interestes of this Republic.</p>

<p>    Having up to the present recieved no
   acknowledgement of that communication and in view of the fact
   that our complications in connection with the North West Boundary
   Question have increased rather than diminished, I begg to enclose
   a copy herewith fearing that hte original may have miscarried.</p>

<p>    I have the honor also to forward you a copy of a Resolution
   of the Senate of this Republci adopted at its late session touching the
   question of the North West Boundary which it had under consideration
       The fact that the government of the United States unsolicited
   by that of Her Majesty the Queen Great Britain and Ireland and
   this State to act as umpire on this question, and in case of any disagree-</p>

<p>Hon. F.L. Frelinghuysen
    Secretary of State
     For the United States of America</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0198.002"/>

<p>ment on the part of the Commissioners representing the two governments
   the decision of the United States would be final. I beg to pull your
   attention to this understanding and to request that your government
   will be kind enought to give some expression on the subject, so as to set
   the matter at rest.</p>

<p>     I need scarcely mention that this perplexing question
   has been and still is the source of deep concern to this Republic and
   a terminatioin of the dispute by the kind intervention of your govern-
   ment would be hailed with great delight and profound gratitude by the
   citizens generally.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be
           your most obedient servant
                G.W. Gibson</p>
