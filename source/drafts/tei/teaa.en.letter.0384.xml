H.M.S "Danae"
Sierra Leone, 19th October 1869

Sir,

On the occasion of my visiting the Island of Anno Bon on the 25th August 1869, the Master of the American Whaling Schooner "Herald" informed me that an American Citizen, by name Claude Payrott had been left on the Island sick and in a destitute condition, there being no constituted authority on the Island, alhough daimed by Spain I took the man on board this ship for Medical carw. He was then in a very emaciated condition but is now convalescent, but hardly fit to be landed at an African Port; I await your decision as to the Consel.

<unclear> for the United States at Sierra Leone his disposal. </unclear>

I am bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia; if you make me a requistion to that effect, I will convey him to Halifax and place him in the hands of the United States Consul at that place.

I have the honor to b,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant
"signed" "W. Graham"
Captain
