to act on their part in the adjustment 
of the Liberian North West Boundary 
called in question by the English
Government and in view of the remarkable 
patience with which the Commodore
and his officers waited upon the movements 
of the Commissioners to their adjournment.
Therefore Resolved by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the Republic
of Liberia in Legislature assembled:</p>

<p>1. That the Legislature of Liberia by this resolution 
tender the thanks of the People of
Liberia to the Presidents of the United States

and to the American Nation for
the cheerful manner in which they

as well as for their choice of so
able a naval officer as Commodore
Shufeldt to perform this important
Mission.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the government
of Liberia express their entire 
satisfaction with the efforts of the Commodore
to have the final and satisfactory
