<p>Legation of Liberia,
        Yonkers, N.Y. Jany 11th, 1867</p>

<p>Sir
        It having been ascertained that
   there is no suitable sailing vessel in the United
   States Navy, nor any suitable steam vessel that
   can (in the judgement of the Secy of the Navy)
   be shared for the purpose of being transferred to
   the governmen t of Liberia, according to the late act
   of Congress, their liberal act towards Liberia cannot
   be made available; of this fact the Liberian gov
   ernment was not yet, at last dates, apprised;
   while, in addition to former <unclear/> reasons for
   desiring it, another still more imminent has 
   arisen.</p>

<p>     The government has information
   that the several tribes along the sea board</p>

<p>To the Hon. William H. Seward
               Secretary of State
                Washington 
                      D.C.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0184.002"/>

<p>being dissatisfied with the interference of
   "Port of Entry" laws with trade with foreign
   vessels on the coast, have concert plans
   for attacking and carrying by force of
   arms, and starvation, Sinoe and Bassa 
   counties, (about two thirds of all the Li
   -berian coast) and the government of
   Liberia, not yet aware of the disppoint
   -ment, which next mail, probably are this,
   has brought them, instructs me, that it is 
   urgently necessary, that the gun Boat should
   be there as early as possible; and to put 
   forth all my endeavors that no time
   may be lost.</p>

<p> Under these circumstances may I 
   ask if the United State government will
   extendf to Liberia the assistance of one
   of her Cruizers on that coast.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be with the highest
   consideration Sir your most obedient servant
                    H.M. Scheiffelin</p>
