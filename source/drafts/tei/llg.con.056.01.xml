</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article IX</head>

<p>[Stricken out by the Senate. (Extradition provisions.)]</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article X</head> 

<p>The Republic of the United States of America, recognizing that it is just and necessary to facilitate to the Independent State of the Congo the accomplishment of the obligations which it has contracted by virtue of the General Act of Brussels of July 2nd 1890,<ref type="footnote" target="n05">5</ref> admits, so far as it is concerned, that import duties may be collected upon merchandise imported into the said State.</p>

<p>The tariff of these duties can not go beyond 10% of the value of the merchandise at the port of importation, during fifteen years to date from July 2nd 1890, except for spirits, which are regulated by the provisions of Chapter VI of the General Act of Brussels.</p>

<p>At the expiration of this term of fifteen years, and in default of a new accord, the United States of America will be replaced, as to the Independent State of the Congo, in the situation which existed prior to July 2nd 1890; the right to impose import duties to a maximum of 10% upon merchandise imported into the said State remaining acquired to it, on the conditions and within the limitations determined in articles XI and XII of this treaty.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article XI</head> 

<p>The United-States shall enjoy in the Independent State of the Congo, as to the import duties, all the advantages accorded to the most favored
 nation. It has been agreed besides: </p>

<p>1. That no differential treatment nor transit duty can be established; </p>

<p>2. That, in the application of the tariff r&#233;gime which will be introduced, the Congo State will apply itself to simplify as far as possible, the formalities and to facilitate the operations of commerce.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article XII</head> 

<p>Considering the fact that in Article X of the present treaty, the United States of America have given their assent to the establishment of import duties in the Independent State of the Congo under certain conditions, it is well understood that the said Independent State of the Congo assures to the flag, to the vessels, to the commerce and to the citizens and inhabitants of the United States of America, in all parts of the territories of that State, all the rights, privileges and immunities concerning import and export duties, tariff regime, interior taxes and charges and, in a general manner, all commercial interests, which are or shall be accorded to the signatory Powers of the Act of Berlin, or to the most favored nation.</p> 

</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article XIII</head>

<p>In case a difference should arise between the two High contracting Parties as to the validity, interpretation, application or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in the present treaty, and it could not be arranged amicably by diplomatic correspondence between the two Governments, these last agree to submit it to the judgment of an arbitration tribunal, the decision of which they bind themselves to respect and execute loyally.</p>

<p>The tribunal will be composed of three members. Each of the two High contracting Parties will designate one of them, selected outside of the citizens and the inhabitants of either of the contracting States and of Belgium. The High contracting Parties will ask, by common accord, a friendly Government to appoint the third arbitrator, to be selected equally outside of the two contracting States and of Belgium.</p>

<p>If an arbitrator should be unable to sit by reason of death, resignation or for any other cause, he shall be replaced by a new arbitrator whose appointment shall be made in the same manner as that of the arbitrator whose place he takes.</p> 

<p>The majority of arbitrators can act in case of the intentional absence or formal withdrawal of the minority. The decision of the majority of the arbitrators will be conclusive upon all questions to be determined.</p> 

<p>The general expenses of the arbitration procedure will be borne, in equal parts, by the two High contracting Parties; but the expenses made by either of the parties for preparing and setting forth its case will be at the cost of that party.</p> 

</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article XIV</head>

<p>It is well understood that if the declaration on the subject of the import duties, signed July 2nd 1890, by the signatory Powers of the Act of Berlin, should not enter into force, in that case, the present treaty would be absolutely null and without effect.</p> 

</div2>

<div2 type="article"> 

<head type="sub">Article XV<ref type="footnote" target="n06">6</ref></head>

<p>The present treaty shall be subject to the approval and the ratification, on the one hand of the President of the United States, acting by the advice and with the consent of the Senate, and, on the other hand, of His Majesty the King of the Belgians, Sovereign of the Independent State of the Congo.</p>
 
<p>The ratifications of the present treaty shall be exchanged at the same time as those of the General Act of BJUS.'Iels of July 2nd 1890, and it will enter into force at the same date as the latter.</p>

</div2>

<div2>
 
<p>In faith of which the respective Plenipotentiaries of the High contracting Parties have signed the present treaty in duplicate, in English and in French, and have attached thereto their seals.</p> 

<p>Done at Brussels the twenty-fourth day of the month of January of the year Eighteen hundred and ninety one.</p>
