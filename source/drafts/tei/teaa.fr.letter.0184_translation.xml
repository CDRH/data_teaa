The General Consul of
France in New York
to Mr. Minister of Foreign
Affairs.
</ab>

<ab>
New York, february 11th 1896.
</ab>

<p>
It exists at No 690 of 8th Avenue,
in New York, a protestant society that,
under the name of "International Missionary
Alliance," works on evangelizing the new
regions open to civilization.
Since 7 years ago when it was founded, it has
arrived at creating around 60 missions of which the
majority are found in Africa and in Asia;
it counts 300 missionnaries and, last
year, it was able to spend for its work
a half-million francs.
</p>

<p>
I received, last week, the
visit of Mr. Rev. Henry Wilson, Doctor
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_122446.jpg"/>

<p>
of theology, president of the Committee of the
Missions of this Association. In
returning to me the report, that Your
Excellence will find enclosed, the work of
the organization since its foundation, Mr. Wilson
called my attention to the extension that
the Society is proposing to give to the
establishments that it created in the
English Colony of Sierra-Leone, along
the river Rokel: eager to cross
the eastern borders of this colony, it
would dream to establish a mission in Farina, 
on the Niger, in French Sudan.
</p>

<p>
But ignoring if the regulations oppose
its installation in our possessions. Mr.
Dr Wilson prays that I indicate to him which
formalities the International Alliance would have
to fill to obtain the permission to evangelize
this region.
</p>

<p>
In the ignorance where I am myself
of all special regulations on this subject, I can
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_122455.jpg"/>

<p>
only signal to you, Mister Minister,
the demand that Mr. Wilson submitted to me in
praying Your Excellence to
inform me of such response that Mr.
Minister of the Colonies would believe to need to give.
</p>

<p>
I see by the budget of the association, that a
sum of more than 40,000 francs was, last
year, spent by it in Brittanic
Sudan and I do not doubt that all effort
is attempted to respond to the christian civilization
among the barbaric tribes of West
Africa do not merit being encouraged.
Nevertheless, since I have been in the United States,
I had the occasion to follow the work of the
majority of the american missionaries and I
must say that in the politcal point of view, their
action did not always <unclear/> to the protection
of all criticism. These are those who
brought the revolution of the Hawaian Islands and
attempted to annex these islands into their country
Aux Iles Carolines, they created
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_122503.jpg"/>

<p>
diffuculties in the Spanish government, in
Anatolia and in Armenia, they <unclear/>
around them ideas of independence that
contributed for many to the
unfortunate event of last Autumn.
Furthermore Dr. Wilson left me <unclear/>
that the work of the Alliance would not have been <unclear>without</unclear>
encountering some opposition in Sierra-Leone
on the part of english rival missions, and
it is my point that our agent in Free Town
could elucidate.
</p>

<p>
If the civil collaboration of
the International Alliance could be accepted
in our possessions, this should only be on
the conditions such as this concourse never <unclear>fuit</unclear>
to become a cause of difficulty for us and
even less cause of financial
reclamations the day where we become to deny
ourselves of these services./.
