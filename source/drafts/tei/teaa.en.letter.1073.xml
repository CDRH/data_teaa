<note>Department of State Received Jun 6 1888</note>

<p>No 12</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States.<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, May 1st 1888.</p>

<p>Mr B. Y. Payne to the Hon.,
Secretary of State</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Receipt of Despatch No 18 Dipo' Series,
and compensation</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your No 18 Diplomatic
Series of the 22nd utl., with enclosure
of form of Account and
Draft, informing me that Mr.
Charles H. J. Taylor has resigned
the position of United States
Minister to Liberia, and his agreement

<fw type="address">Hon., T. F. Bayard<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</fw>

<pb n="Roll5-1286.jpg"/>

agreement with me, as to my
compensation during his leave
of absence has expired: also
informing me that the Department
desires me to remain in charge
of the archives of the Legation and
Consulate General, pending the
arrival of a successor to Mr
Taylor, stating further that I shall
receive the same compensation for
service viz $300. per annum, the
amount allowed me by Mr Taylor.</p>

<p>I thank you, for the confidence
<unclear>reposed</unclear> in me, in wishing
me to remain in charge of the
Legation.</p>

<p>For your better information, I
enclose Mr. Taylor's two letters to
me, in which he offered me
<catchwords>me</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1287.jpg"/>

me the position with compensation
at the rate of $300. per annum.
You are aware I contracted with
Mr. Taylor for this amount, but you
will see by his letter and the contract
that I was already employed, and
would have nothing to do, but
attend the mails, and keep in safety 
the Archives of the Legation: Since,
a Bond of $3000. has been required
of me, which I have forwarded to
the Department.</p>

<p>I consented to receive the compensation
offered by Mr Taylor, because he
would be absent but twelve (12)
weeks, as I had occasion to
refer you to some time ago; now
that Mr Taylor's functions has
ceased, and I required to give
<catchwords>give</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1288.jpg"/>

give the Bond required of a Vice
Consul General. I cannot <unclear></unclear>
for the compensation offend, hence,
I do not sign the Draft for
services to 31st March, at Mr Taylor's
rate of compensation, but retain
it, and await your advice, as I am
quite satisfied you can
see my position. I have in many
instance lost in my other avocation
to do justice and hence to the
trust I have.</p>

<p>I do not object to receiving
compensation at the rate contracted
with Mr. Taylor for the terms of
his incumbency, therefore I have
this day drawn my Draft No 1
on the Secretary of State for
services according to the Contract
Contract</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1289.jpg"/>

<p>Contract from October 3rd 1887 (The
date of Mr Taylor's departure)
to the 12th January 1888 when his
official function, and my contract
with him ceased.</p>

<p>I enclose account <unclear></unclear>, as
per copy for form, transmitted
to me.</p>

<p>Having forwarded my Bond to
the Department, and reported,
I consider myself directly
responsible to the Government of
the United States, and to it will
I expect compensation for
service from January 12th 1888.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obedient Servant</p>

<p>Beverly Y. Payne</p>
