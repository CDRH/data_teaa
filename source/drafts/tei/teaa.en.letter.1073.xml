<p>No 12</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States.<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, May 1st 1888.</p>

<p>Mr B. Y. Payne to the Hon.,
Secretary of State</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Receipt of Despatch No 18 Dipo' Series,
and compensation</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your No 18 Diplomatic
Series of the 22nd utl., with enclosure
of form of Account and
Draft, informing me that Mr.
Charles H. J. Taylor has resigned
the position of United States
Minister to Liberia, and his agreement

agreement with me, as to my
compensation during his leave
of absence has expired: also
informing me that the Department
desires me to remain in charge
of the archives of the Legation and
Consulate General, pending the
arrival of a successor to Mr
Taylor, stating further that I shall
receive the same compensation for
service viz $300. per annum, the
amount allowed me by Mr Taylor.</p>

<p>I thank you, for the confidence
<unclear>reposed</unclear> in me, in wishing
me to remain in charge of the
Legation.</p>

<p>For your better information, I
enclose Mr. Taylor's two letters to
me, in which he offered me
<catchwords>me</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1287.jpg"/>

me the position with compensation
at the rate of $300. per annum.
You are aware I contracted with
Mr. Taylor for this amount, but you
will see by his letter and the contract
that I was already employed, and
would have nothing to do, but
attend the mails, and keep in safety 
the Archives of the Legation: Since,
a Bond of $3000. has been required
of me, which I have forwarded to
the Department.</p>

<p>I consented to receive the compensation
offered by Mr Taylor, because he
would be absent but twelve (12)
weeks, as I had occasion to
refer you to some time ago; now
that Mr Taylor's functions has
ceased, and I required to give
<catchwords>give</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1288.jpg"/>

give the Bond required of a Vice
Consul General. I cannot serve
for the compensation offered, hence,
I do not sign the Draft for
services to 31st March, at Mr Taylor's
rate of compensation, but retain
it, and await your advice, as 
I am quite satisfied you can
see my position. I have in many
instances lost in my other avocation
to do justice and honor to the
trust I have.</p>

<p>I do not object to receiving
compensation at the rate contracted
with Mr Taylor, for the time of
his incumbency, therefore I have
this day drawn my Draft No 1
on the Secretary of State for
services according to the Contract
<catchwords>Contract</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1289.jpg"/>

Contract from October 3rd 1887, (the
date of Mr Taylor's departure)
to the 12th January 1888, when his
official function, and my contract
with him ceased.</p>

<p>I enclose Account <unclear extent="one word"/>, as
per copy or form transmitted
to me.</p>

<p>Having forwarded my Bond to
the Department, and reported,
I consider myself directly
responsible to the Government of
the United States, and to it will
I expect compensation for
service from January 12th 1888.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
Beverly Y. Payne</p>

<p>Capt. Beverly Y. Payne,<lb/>

Monrovia Liberia.,</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Without any
Application having been filed by you, in
the U.S. Legation, for any position within
my gift, I do hereby say to you that if you
feel disposed to take charge of the Legation
in my absence, until my return to the country,
I will immediately upon my return
nominate you for the position of U.S. Vice
Consul Gen'l for the Republic of Liberia. I
would nominate you now, only I have declared
to the Department at Washington, my intention
of allowing the post of Vice Consul Gen'l to
remain vacant, until the embarrassing
situation of the late Vice Consul Gen'l here,
shall have been explained, and passed on.
You will please decide in reference to
this matter on or before the 22nd inst. If you
consent to accept the trust I will enter
into a contract to pay you at the rate of
$300 per annum, for the time I am absent.

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I am in receipt of
your favor, of even date herewith, accepting the Position of
<hi rend="italics">Acting Vice Consul General</hi>, for the United States. Please
find enclosed a "blank contract" which you will
greatly oblige me to make duplicate (2) copies of. Return
the then, (3) three copies to me. I will sign them
with you, giving into your possession one copy,
filing with the Department of State in Washington,
one; and retaining one copy myself. The matter
of your being from the date of my departure
<hi rend="italics">U.S. Acting Vice Consul General</hi>, is no longer a
secret. You are at liberty to make statement of the
fact, to anyone you please. At any time in the future
when you may feel disposed, after your
regular hours in the store, you may call on me,
when I will proceed to give you such instructions
as I may think proper for you to know, in order to
insure a correct discharge of duty. I can assure
you, that only two things moved me to appoint you.
First, your conduct, as an upright young man, and
the fact that you hold no civil office in the Republic.
I predict, for you a "brilliant future" if you
maintain through life, your present course.</p>

<p>I am sir, your obedient servant.<lb/>
Chas. H. J. Taylor.</p>
