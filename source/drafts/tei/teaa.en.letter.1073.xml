<p><add>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
JUN 6 1888
RECEIVED.</add></p>

<p>No 12</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States.
Monrovia, Liberia, May 1st 1888.</p>

<p>Mr B. Y. Payne to the Hon.,
Secretary of State</p>

<p>Subject</p>

<p>Receipt of Despatch No 18 Dipo' Series,
and compensation</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your No 18 Diplomatic
Series of the 22nd utl., with enclosure
of form of Account and
Draft, informing <unclear></unclear> that Mr.
Charles H. J. Taylor has resigned
the position of United States
Minister to Liberia, and his agreement</p>

<p>Hon., T. F. Bayard
Secretary of State</p>

<p>agreement</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1286.jpg"/>

<p>agreement with me, as to my
compensation during his leave
of absence has expired: also ~
informing you that the Department
desires me to remain in charge
of the archives of the Legation and
Consulate General, pending the
arrival of a successer to Mr
Taylor, stating further that I shall
receive the same compensation for
service of $300 per annum, the
account allowed me by Mr Taylor.</p>

<p>I thank you, for the confidence
reposed in me, in wishing
me to remain in charge of the
Legation.</p>

<p>For your better information, I
enclose Mr. Taylor's two letters to
me, in which he offered me
me</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1287.jpg"/>

<p>me the position with compensation
at the rate of $300 per annum.
You are aware I contracted with
Mr. Taylor for this amount, but you
will see by his letter and the contract
that I was already employed, and
would have nothing to do, but
attend the mails, and keep in safety 
the Archives of the Legation: SInce,
a Bond of $3000 has bee required
of me, which I have forwarded to
the Department.</p>

<p>I consented to receive the compensation
offered by Mr. Taylor because he
would be absent but twelve (12) ~
vessels, as I had occasion to
refer you to some time ago: now
that Mr. Taylor's functions has
ceased, and I required to give
give</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1288.jpg"/>

<p>give the Bond required of a Vice
Consul General. I cannot <unclear></unclear>
for the compensation offend, hence,
I do not sign the Draft for
services to 31st March, at Mr Taylor's
rate of compensation, but retain
it, and await your advice, as I am
quite satisfied you can
see my position. I have in many
instance lost in my other avocation
to do justice and hence to the
trust I have.</p>

<p>I do not object to receiving
compensation at the rate contracted
with Mr. Taylor for the terms of
his incumbency, therefore I have
this day drawn my Draft No 1
on the Secretary of State for
services according to the Contract
Contract</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1289.jpg"/>

<p>Contract from October 3rd 1887 (The
date of Mr Taylor's departure)
to the 12th January 1888 when his
official function, and my contract
with him ceased.</p>

<p>I enclose account <unclear></unclear>, as
per copy for form, transmitted
to me.</p>

<p>Having forwarded my Bond to
the Department, and reported,
I consider myself directly
responsible to the Government of
the United States, and to it will
I expect compensation for
service from January 12th 1888.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obedient Servant</p>

<p>Beverly Y. Payne</p>

<p>Enclosures,
Mr Taylor to Mr Payne
Sec'y Barclay,, ,, Taylor

application having been filed by you, in
the U.S. Legation for any position within
my gift. I do hereby say to you that if you
feel disposed to take charge of the Legation
in my absence, until my return to the country,
I will immediately upon my return
