Sir,
I have the honor to report to you for the Depatments information the appearance, on the 30th ultimo, in this port of an American Ssloop called the "Champion" of 30 31/100 Tons measurement of Noank, Conneticut; The Captain, William W. Co, arrived at the Isle de Loss, according to his report coming from Gorce, without another soul but himself on board, he stated to me that

that in landig near Gorce this Boat capsized and he lost his Ship's papers, however, he deposited with me a properly authenticated power to sell the Sloop. The Crew list he stated was lost anf his crew had deserted. 

The case looks suspicious to me and I report it for your investigation.

Captain Cox was very anxious to put the Sloop under British Colors but not bein able to propose a bonafide processs I refused to do so. He has left this part on the 21st instant; destination Isle de Loss.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
Rosenbush
U.S.Vice Counsel Agt.
