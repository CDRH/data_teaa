Sir,
In my communication dated at
Washington on the 20th ull I informed you
that so soon as the necessary documents (then
on their way from Boston) came to hand, the
explanation called for by your letters of the 19th, in relation to the refusal of the USS
Yorktown to salute the French Fort Aumale
should be furnished; these papers having been
received, I am enabled to collect from the report
of Commander Bell, and the correspondance
which took place on the occasion the following
particulars: It appears that on the 14th day
of Novr 1845, that officer entered the river
Gaboon (Africa) with the USS Yorktown
under his command; in proceding up the
river he passed a small blockhause erected
on the bank by the French. At 3"30' P.M.
he anchored the ship off King Glass town,
4 miles above said block hause. At 8 A.M
the following day an officer came on board

<p>
from the French brick of mar "Malouine"
with the commander's compliments, at the
same time he handed Commandant Bell
a note. On the officer's retiring he opended
it was from the commanding officer of the
blockhause expressing surprise that he,
Commander Bell, should have passed the
fort without saluting, and then officially
demanded a salute to the French flag.
Commander Bell took no notice of the
peremptory demand. He sent an officer
on board the "Malouine" to return the
usual civilities, at the same time regressed
the commander to take charge of a letter
directed to the commanding officer of the
French forces on the station, to which he
readily assented. The next day Commander
Bell sent the letter on board, the Commander
of the "Malouine" refused to receive it, unless
Commander Bell saluted or made a suitable
explanation. This his determination he
conveyed to Comm. Bell in writing. Both
