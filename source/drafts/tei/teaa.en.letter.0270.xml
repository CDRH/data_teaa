Dear Sir, 
I have the honor to 
inform upon that, I arrived here upon
the 3rd day of November 1869.

The vessel
upon which I took pasasage from the 
United States was unavoidably delayed. 
Causing me to be much longer 
reaching this place than I anticiplated 
when I left New York.

In 
order to account for ant informaties 
that, may exist in the present,
corespondence permits me to state 
that the book forwarded me from the 
departments of sate entitles Lestructions 
to Consuls and Commercial 
Agents was mislaid in America and 
has not yet reached me i would 
respectfully request that another book be sent to me.

I have recieved information through
Commandore Baron Divdeloh of the 
French fleet upon this coasr that 
there are two iron clad reven gun
brats at the reslands of CAPE dE
verdic, which had succeded in destroying 
a number of American Merchants 
vessels and wwell more in wait for
the United States ship of Bar
Saratoga supposed by them to be bound 
up the Coast. i have no information
in regard to the whereabouts 
of the Saratoga. I have written 
yo yhr Coml. Agts. Monrovia 
and to CAPE palmas as they 
are the only points upon the Coast,
where she would be likely to
stop if found from down the coast 
Commondore J.B. recured his
information through the Pourtegese 
Mail thush from the Lisbon to 
St paul de Loando.

By information received from 
the same source. (Commandere S.)
from the spanish authorities at
Fernando Po I have reason to as
pretend. that the same difficulties 
that existed between the governments
of the United States and 
Spain in the years 1859 and 1860
in relation too Spanish interference 
<unclearr> mth-Pomere Missionaries </unclearr>
upon the island of Courisco
are likely to be received. 

A copy of the regulations of 
the Hon. Secretary of Treasury to 
Which reference is made in Circular 
of 17 of July 31st 1862. has not 
reached me.

I have the honor to
be Your most obi. servant
Henry May Com.Agnt.
