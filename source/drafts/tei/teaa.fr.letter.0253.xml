<p>Legation of the United States of America</p>

<p>Brussels January 5, 1888</p>
    
<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your esteemed note of the 31st ultimo which I have carefully
read.</p>
    
<p>No purpose however philanthropic or praiseworthy, which Mr. Stanley had in view as the commandant of 
a private enterprise, could justify or excuse his arbitrary and violent acts in attempting, with the aid of an armed force, to seize and appropriate the private property of persons, without their consent, which he found within the limits of the Congo Free State, and I felt confident that the Government of the State would strongly disapprove of such conduct.</p>
    
<p>I am glad to know that your Government is in possession of evidence which relieves its <fw type="catch">agent</fw>

agent at Stanley-Pool from the imputation of covertly favoring Stanley's project to take possession of the boat, against the will of her owners.</p>

<p>I feel assured that my Government will learn with sincere satisfaction and pleasure, that the subsequent seizure of the boat by Lieut Van Gele, was made under a misapprehension as to her having been hired by the State, and that she was still in its service; that the Government of the State, as soon as it learned of the fact ordered her restitution to the owners, which was done; and that the complainants have been liberally indemnified for the injury which had been occasioned to them.</p>

<p>I profit by the occasions to <fw type="catch">renew</fw>

renew to you, Sir, the assurances of my most distinguished consideration.</p>
    
<p>Lambert Tree</p>
