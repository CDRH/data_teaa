<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia, April <sic>26</sic>, 1882</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<p>I have the honor to advise the Department that I have moved, on the 1e of April inst the office room of the <sic>US.</sic> Legation and Consulate General, to <sic>an other</sic> place; the <sic>rason</sic> for so doing, is, 1e to prevent and involving in a possible lawsuit between the owner of the building, and the administratrix of the estate of H. H. Garnet, for the rent of a dwelling house. 2e the condition of the office room.</p>

<p>The entire building above named and containing 12 rooms was, under a <sic>privat</sic> contract, rented for 2 years, for the annual sum of $300.00 to the late H. H. Garnet, binding no heirs, or Administrators or Legation in case of death or otherwise.</p>

<p>Only one room on the first floor being occupied for office, all the other rooms for family use.</p>

<p>The owner of the house <sic>afther</sic> the death of minister Garnet, keep the Estate responsible for the rent, which estate, seems not willing to pay, and therefore the whole family has left the house, carrying all the furniture etc. and now occupying a house on the St Pauls River <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-3025.jpg"/>

the office room being in a <sic>verry</sic> declined state and the house now entirely unoccupied, for the safety of the archives and furniture, I concluded to move the office to a place where the same is direct under my control, day and night, and also situated in the center of the city.</p>

<p>I have offered to pay for office rent during the quarter ending 31e of march, the amount of $30.00 but refused strictly the pay one cent more, as the contract did not bind the Legation for any time. this offer first being accepted, seems <sic>afther</sic> to have been abandoned, as <sic>nither</sic> owner nor administratrix have called on this office use to date for any payment.</p>

<p>for better satisfaction of the Department, I sent enclosed a true copy of the contract</p>

<p>With renewed sentiments of esteem<lb/>
I am sir your obedt servt<lb/>
