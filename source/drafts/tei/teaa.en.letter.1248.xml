recommended to me, as

so meet your approval,
as to insane an early

<p>Dear Sir,
Your esteemed favor of the 18th
August 1898 has been forwarded to me here.
Mr. G. E. Eminsang died since I left the Gold Coast
for this country but I have been informed of this oath by
my friends residing in the same town, and by the notice
in the Treat and English Press.</p>

<p>Mr J. E. Eminsang, your correspondent, is the son of the
late Mr. G. E. Eminsang, and is a youth of good character,
but otherwise I know nothing of him.</p>

<p>I am willing to accept the appointment of United States
Consular Agent for the Gold Coast Colony. I presume that
the <unclear></unclear> enjoyed by the late Mr Eminsang will
be continued to me.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir,
your obedient servant</p>

<p>Please address reply to me at Cape Coast to which place
I shall shortly return. </p>
