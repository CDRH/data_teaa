They are now upon this consulate for over a month, and
not expecting any Am: vessel for the present, I shall be
obliged to send them by some Portuguese merchant, vessel
to Lisbon, if the Capt will take them, these men have not
any clothes or shoes, but those given to them by this 
consulate</p>

50 P.C. of good Indian Rubber is 
<unclear>exhacted</unclear>, <unclear>what</unclear> regards to wheat, this 
country has not produced anything to 
speak of, as they have not turned their 
attention to its cultivation, but lately and it has been
sown to considerable extent, and they sanguinely expect
a great result.</p>

<p>"American Shipping" The Am: Ship "Shelton" Capt. S.B.
Potter, entered this port on the 7th of october sailed on 
the 19th of the same month; Whaling?
On the 12th of the same month entd America Bark
"Alice Knowles" Capt Thomas Foster, came in to request
and returned  Whaling on the 19th of the same. 
On the 10th of the same month entered Am. Ship
"Eliza Adams" Capt Walter F. Howland; also came in
to refresh and returned Whaling on the 27th ditto.
From the Bark "Alice Knowles" the Sailor Henry
Williams was landed sick, and who will go 
on to your City by the first packet, leaving a 
Certificate from this agency dated october 26th 1882.
The "Eliza Adams" shipped  on the 25th ult. 4 sailors,
2 of which ran away immediately after signing
their articles and receiving 8 dollars and 50 cents
in advance; they were arrested 2 days after 
the sailing of the ship, and I intend
sending them on to your consulate by first
favorable opportunity that you may dispose
of them as you may think fit; It is probable
that I shall have to advance the money for
their passage of which I will duly advise
you. Their names are "David Miller" and
"Charles Sims". Another sailor, by name of 
"Augusto Fernandes" ran away from the said 
ship, and came to day to present himself to 
me; I shall send him also to you with 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0158.004"/>

with the other 2. and advise the amount of passages
and expences which I have advanced them here
It seems to me proper to send them to Loanda
that it may be known hereafter to all others
coming here in future, that such acts will not 
be countenanced without being punished
according to Law.</p>

<p>Being all for the present, I remain with all
due respect and consideration<lb/>
"Signed" João L. Torres<lb/>
U.S. Consul Agent</p>

<p>P.S. The sailor above described as "Augustus Fernandes,
is Augustus Jason".</p>
