<p>J. A. Lewis To Dept State</p>

<p>Transmitting Dispatch on American

and recommendation for
reclassification of Consulate</p>

<p>34 Smith St Brooklyn N.Y.<lb/>
June 5th 1880</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst Secty State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the
honor to transmit<del>t</del> herewith 
Dispatch on "The American
trade on the West Coast 
of Africa &amp; how the same
may be increased,"
together with a recommendation
that the Consulate at
Sierra Leone be placed in
"Class C," duly endorsed
by a goodly number of
solid merchants &amp; shippers
together with two Bank Presidents.
The list of signers might have 
been greatly extended but I 
consider the number sufficient.</p>

<p>Brooklyn N. Y. June 1st 1880</p>

<p>J A Lewis To Dept State</p>

<p>Regarding American trade
on the West Coast of Africa</p>

<pb n="498"/>

<p>Brooklyn N.Y. June 1st 1880</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst Secty of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the
honor in accordance with your
suggestion, as also that of Mr
Wood Chief of the Consular Bureau,
to forward you this 
Dispatch, with regard to the American
trade on the West Coast
of Africa, and how the same
may be increased.</p>

<p>In the first place a few
words regarding the memo
submitted to me by Mr Wood,
viz, The Establishing of more United
States Consulates on the West Coast
and having them under the supervision
of and report through the Minister
Resident and Consul General of Liberia</p>

<p>With regard to the establishing
of new Consulates where
only Fees are allowed the
only objection

<pb n="500"/>

objection would be the Expense of
Books, Blanks and necessary
<sic>paraphanalia</sic> for opening up
new offices. At points where
only an occasional American vessel
touches the Fees would be so
small as really to be no incentive
for even a live energetic 
American citizen to exert
himself, and any other but
live, energetic American would
be of very little if any value
and good men I believe are 
rarely to be found at the
points where it is thought
advisable to open new Consulates,
hence I can see very little
advantage to be obtained from
increasing the number of Consulates 
by opening new
offices at insignificant
points on the West Coast.</p>

<p>With regard to the Consuls
on the West Coast, being under
the <sic>Supervission</sic> of and reporting
directly to the Minister Resident
and Consul General of Liberia:
I think for the Consuls and Consular
<catchwords>Agents</catchwords>

<pb n="501"/>

Agents who are within the Republic 
of Liberia this would be well
enough, but I can see no
good reason or advantage
to be gained from the Consulate
at Sierra Leone reporting backward
to an insignificant
town, at which only about
one half or one third of the
Mail Steamers going either North
or South even touch, it would 
certainly greatly delay all correspondence
and communication
between the said Sierra Leone
Consulate and the Department
without in my opinion, being
of any advantage. Personally
I should much prefer reporting
directly to the Department.
So much regarding the increase of Consulates and manner <del>of</del>
of reporting.</p>

<p>Now what can be 
done to increase the trade of
American products on the West
Coast of Africa?</p>

<p>In the first place no foreigner
be he Government Official
<catchwords>or</catchwords>

<pb n="502"/>

or private citizen, can be expected
to interest himself in favor of the
United States unless it is for his
personal benefit to do so,
it is only from Americans 
and live, energetic, men that
anything can be expected
and then in proportion to 
circumstances and their surroundings.</p>

<p>Shippers in the United States and
traders and merchants abroad are
always ready to deal in such goods
as find a ready sale at a satisfactory
profit, the order however
must come from the 
merchant who sells, for it is
only he who knows what goods
his market requires.</p>

<p>My own personal experience
abroad has taught me this
one important fact, that
"Illustrated American Export Journals"
where in all sorts of merchandise
is advertised and illustrated
have wrought a very important
work for the benefit of American
trade abroad. Many articles have been
introduced and found ready sale
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb n="503"/>

in Sierra Leone through the direct
agency of these said Journals
which are sent regularly and
gratuitously by the publishers
to the U.S. Consuls.</p>

<p>The scope of this advertising and
illustrating in these Journals
should be greatly extended by 
all merchants and those who
are interested in export goods.
The idea is simply this, if you cannot show and furnish to
the merchant abroad a sample
of the article itself, the next best thing
(and by far the cheaper) is the furnish
a picture with description
thereby enabling in very many
instances, the foreign merchant
to form an accurate idea of
the said article in which case
he will order and pay for
at least a sample of the goods
until they can be tried and
thoroughly tested. in this way
thousands upon thousands
of dollars worth of American
goods are finding new markets
yearly, as they have only to be 
<catchwords>known</catchwords>

<pb n="504"/>

known to be appreciated.</p>

<p>Again shall the Government
on the merchants work up this
additional trade? probably both
should assist in this very
important work. The Government
so far as it can do so
consistently with the public <sic>wellfare</sic>
on the idea of the greatest
good to the greatest number.
Now how much does the Government expect, and how much
claim has it upon its Consuls
for this purpose? If the Government
pays the Consul for his
entire time it is entitled to
his entire services, and for
such proportion of services as
he receives proportion of pay.
If an American leaves his
own country and all its
associations and goes to a 
far off and unhealthy place
where there are few comforts
and no luxuries and engages
in business for a livelihood
and accepts the position of
Consul and maintains the
<catchwords>honor</catchwords>

<pb n="505"/>

honor and dignity of the flag
as a United States representative
with all the responsibilities
and routine labor of the
Office and only receives 
a few dollars in Fees it is
hardly expected that he has
the time or inclination to exert
himself on an outside
matter for the benefit of 
others.</p>

<p>The work which is being
accomplished by Commodore
Shufeldt and his officers
is no doubt a very important
one and will repay
the Government many fold.
And I would recommend
that an American Man of
War should be allowed to 
visit the West Coast of Africa
from time to time in the interest
not of war but of commerce
with special instructions to
study up the needs of the various
markets and report accordingly
and to these American Men
of War thus cruising along 
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="506"/>

the coast the U.S. Consul
could be of very great
service. in this way the
consumer abroad and
the manufacturer at home
could be made acquainted
with each others wants and 
the Government <sic>benefitted</sic>
in many ways.</p>

<p>Another method of opening
up new trade would be to
establish a Commercial depot
at some point on the coast
where samples of goods should
be kept for inspection.</p>

<p>This could be done by the
Government and merchants
together. The Government
furnishing the man in charge
who could be a government
official and who might give
records for the faithful and honest
performance of his duty in
which case merchants would
no doubt furnish samples of
their goods free, depending on
future orders for their remunerative
it would in other words be
<catchwords>opening</catchwords>

<pb n="507"/>

opening of an Exposition where
all merchants and travellers as
they pass up and down the
coast could inspect free 
of charge the goods, and give 
their orders. in other words
this would be the American
Market to which all merchants
north &amp; south at very little
expense could come for their
supplies, instead of visiting
New York Boston Philadelphia
Baltimore and Chicago (which is impossible)
for their goods. They
would find nearly as favorable
a chance to select goods near
at home and the Government
could assist in an enterprise
of this kind and the merchants
combined would do the 
balance.</p>

<p>Again as I have already
said in a former dispatch
merchants who desire to extend
their trade abroad ought to
evince a little more liberality
than heretofore in discounts on
sample goods and I have no 
<catchwords>doubt</catchwords>

<pb n="508"/>

doubt they would if the subject
matter was properly brought
to their notice and they could 
be assured that their goods
were placed in the hands of
honest men and especially,
authorized officials of the United
States Government.</p>

<p>Transportation is a very important
matter to be considered
in this connection without
which the finest schemes and
plans are comparatively worthless.
when samples of goods
have been shown and are
accepted and orders given for
them, then transportation must
be at command to place <del>in</del>
the articles in the market. at 
present the only direct communication
is by sailing
vessels from New York and 
Boston. It would seem that 
the time is not far distant
when a line of American
Steamers sailing from New York
to Madeira, Canary Islands, the 
Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb n="509"/>

and so on down the West
Coast will present a <unclear>field</unclear>
sufficiently investing for capitalists
to safely and profitably engage
in. This is possibly an
enterprise in which the Government 
could render
valuable assistance.</p>

<note>Department of State Received Jun 7 1880</note>

<p>New York June 2nd 1880.</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst Secty of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the
honor respectfully to recommend
to the Department that
the Consulate at Sierra Leone 
West Coast of Africa be
reclassified and placed
in class "C."</p>

<p>Sierra Leone is one of the 
most important Military, 
Naval and trading stations
on the West Coast and I believe
it would be for the best
interest of American Commerce
that this action be taken at
least temporarily as an
experiment.</p>

<p>I have the honor to
remain Sir<lb/>
Your Most Obt Servt<lb/>
Judson A. Lewis<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<pb n="511"/>

<p>We whose names are

endorse the above
recommendation of
Judson A. Lewis knowing
