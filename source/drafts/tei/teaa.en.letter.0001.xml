<opener><dateline>Loanda S.W. Coast of Africa<lb/>
January 12th 1854</dateline>

<salute>Hon. Wm. L Marcy<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
U. S. America</salute></opener>

<p>Sir.<lb/>
By the Bark "Seamen"
which vessel arrived at Ambriz on the 28th ult. I had
the pleasure of receiving a Commission from your
Department as U. S. Coml. Agent for Loanda.
On the arrival of the "Seamen" at this port I shall
without doubt receive the U.S. Flag, Seal of Office,
&#38; several Books which I am informed are on board. </p>

<p>On the 12th November 1853, Commodore Mayo
commissioned me as Acting U. S. Consul, the Governor of
this Province accepted me as such as far as his power
so to do extended &#38; my name has been sent to the
Queen of Portugal for confirmation.</p>

<p>Taking into
consideration these circumstances I now take the
liberty of requesting the President to appoint me
U. S. Consul instead of U. S. Coml. Agent.</p>

<p>The fees as Consul for this port will not amount
to more than $70 or $80 a year.</p>

<p>You will please inform me if a Commander
of a U. S. Man of War has a right to put men taken
from an alleged or real slaver on shore at this port &#38;
if so &#38; these men are taken sick or need assistance is
the Consul obliged to render such assistance. </p>

<p>You will also please inform me if the Consignee 
of an American vessel is obliged to hand the Invoices

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0001.002"/>

of the Cargo homeward to the Consul in order that the 
Consul may certify the correctness of the same and
also the value of the Spanish dollar in this currency.</p>

<p>As regards the Bond which you sent me I shall
forward it to Salem for the Signatures by the first direct
opportunity which however will probably not be till
March or April.</p>

<p>I shall send to your Department a list
of American Vessels entering or clearing at this port
&#38;c every six months.</p>

<p>In answer to your request to
inform the Department the name of the State in
which I was born, I will say I was born in Salem,
in the State of Massachusetts, &#38; I have always resided
there with the exception a few months passed in
Rio Grande, Brazil, till I came to Loanda, at which 
place arrived in September 1853.</p>

<p>I should have 
wrote you previous to this in relation to my appointment
by Com. Mayo but as my friends had made the request
at Washington I deemed it unnecessary till I received
advices from your Department.</p>

<p>Any Letters or Instructions
that you may be pleased to send me you can
direct to the care of R Brookhouse Esq. Salem,
Mass. who will forward them by first opportunity.</p>

<closer><salute>Very Respectfully,<lb/>
Your Obt. Servt</salute>
<signed>John G. Willis</signed></closer>

<postscript>
<p>The "Constitution" sailed from Loanda for St. Helena Nov 17, '53.</p>
<p>The "Marion" is now in the neighborhood of the Congo River &#38; Ambriz.</p>
<p>The "Perry" has not been here since February '53.</p>
