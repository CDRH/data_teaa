<note>Department of State Received Apr 4 1888</note>

<p>Franklin Co<lb/>
North Carolina<lb/>
April 1st/88.</p>

<p>Hon. G. L. Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>My business with the Department
of State was not fully accomplished
before I had to take my leave. I was
anxious to see you, but could not,
now therefore I write; to see if justice
can be given me. I know you will
do what is just and right. Of the
amount due on my salary as
U.S. Vice Consul Genl in the place of
Moses A. Hopkins who died at this post
of duty in Liberia your

<pb n="Roll5-1271.jpg"/>

government disallowed me $411.88
which is unjust. I did not spend
that much money <unclear extent="one word"/>. I buried
Moses A Hopkins U.S. Minister
Resident and Consul Genl at Monrovia
who when he died had not penny
with which to lay him away to rest,
for which amount of $95.95 I paid
out of my pocket to have him bury
with honor to your government and
your government has disallowed me
that amount.</p>

<p>I paid messenger of the Legation $15.
per quarter during my stay at that
post of duty which also your
government has disallowed, because
I could not present <del>a</del> vouchers.
Your honor the messenger of the
Legation was a native boy and
could not write and therefore I

<pb n="Roll5-1272.jpg"/>

was unable to obtain vouchers.
Further still I could not draw drafts in
his name for such a small sum
as $15. per quarter (and often I had to
pay him monthly.) therefore I got the
firm of G. Moore &amp; Son to pay him and I
drew drafts in their name at the
end of the quarter. I claim, sir, that
at any rate $135.95 if not all of $411.88
which is due me should not be
disallowed. I did not do anything
while U.S. Vice Consul Genl which
my predecessors did not do. I
followed them according to the record
they left behind. Further more your
honor. I took charge of the Legation
at Liberia under peculiar circumstances,
for I was not acquainted with
its laws and regulations, and
further more when I took the Legation

<pb n="Roll5-1273.jpg"/>

in charge I had not filed my bond
in the Treasury Department. All I did
I did for the honor of your government
regardless of feeling for the bereaved
family. I want just. I cannot depend
upon the widow of Moses A. Hopkins for
my pay for what I have done to
honor your government in a foreign
land. If your government has decided
not to pay me for burying Moses A.
Hopkins please inform the widow of
such in order that I might get the
money I have spent. I am a poor
man and I need my money, therefore
your honor please see that justice
be given me. Hoping my humble
cry will meet your earnest attention</p>

<p>I remain, Sir,<lb/>
Respectfully<lb/>
Sam'l S. Sevier<lb/>
Ex-Vice Consul Genl.</p>
