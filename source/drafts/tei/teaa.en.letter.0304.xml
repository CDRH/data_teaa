Sir,

Your
communication of the sixth in >uncertain<ab></ab>
the 14t has been received. I am requesting 
to inform the Department why my request 
sent of office was not presented previously*

I wrote to the 
Department while in Africa in regard the time of 
Office and recieved for answers that would *unclear
and forward to the Department a officials signed 
by the respects to the effect that 
entails an office and said Office by vessels for 
Governement purposes one for no other. That 
accept such a certificate the Department would 
inform me of its decision. I immmediately forwarded 
Gordon + Bumma certifying to the above facts also 
certifyinh that in their judgement the rest of said 
Officers was over five hundred and fifty dollars 
per ammunition of more received any be the 
certificate. I delayed writing again in regard to this 
matter not wishing to call attention again to the *unclear
it supposed was already under consideration.

This liked to be press the claim after once fairly presenting 
it at a time when it seemed to be one you must 
have so much of greater importance to occupy your 
mention Another resaon too was the diffculty 
*unclear* in that for off out of the way country in 
putting drafts cashed without paying such extreme
taxes of exhange + then perhaps not at all. 

The above are the plants of unsaid 

Why I did not present greatly accounts of collect not 
Faculty for by Office. I am quite sure I want nothing
but what is just and honorable in the nature.


Your 
Communication stated that my account cannot be
allowed until *unclear* vouched and furnished the
Department. The muchin before refered to as 
having you signed by Nupris Poulvre +Bamma I think 
must have been received by the Department if so please
inform me as soon the *unclear* as necessary. If Baked
make was not received please inform me; and I 
would next unexpectedly request your indulgence
in this matter as I have no dates of communicaitons
within which in Africa/

I am Sir with the highest 
Consideration Your most humble 
+ obident Servant

Late U.S. Comml. Agt.
