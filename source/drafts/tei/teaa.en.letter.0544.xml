<note>No. 12</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, February 26, 1890</p>

<p>Honorable<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In reply to the circular from
the Department, dated November 25,
I have the honor to report:</p>

<p>1st. There are no refrigerators
in this Consular district.</p>

<p>2nd. Being unacquainted with 
the construction of them or their
operation under different conditions,
I cannot say if any peculiar
feature would be requisite for
this district, unless it might be 
that the machine ought to be an
ice-making one and refrigerator
combined.</p>

<p>3rd Answered in first paragraph.</p>

<p>4th " " " "</p>

<p>5th There are a few, not more
<catchwords>than</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0544.002"/>

three or four small French ice-machines 
in use here, and not 
one of them is capable of turning
out more than may be, two or
three kilos of ice per day. They
are seldom put to such use however,
the cooling of water being the
usual content of their services.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the charge
would be per 100 lb of ice if that
quantity could be produced here
for sale. I can however say that
for about a quart of lemonade
made of lime-juice, sugar and
this machine cooled water a charge
of thirty cents is made. Value of lime
juice and sugar
5 cents.</p>

<p>A machine turning out 100 to
200 kilos of block-ice per day,
(refrigerator combined) would
meet the present wants of this city.</p>

<p>The principal hotel proprietor
of the place. Mr F. Frugier, is 
anxious to purchase such a
machine, but not at prompt
payment, as his capital is very,
<catchwords>limited</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0544.003"/>

limited. He suggests payment of
a certain proportion on delivery
and rest by instalments.</p>

<p>I would suggest that catalogues
with designs be forwarded to me, 
stating price, cost of working
to produce 100 to 200 kilos of ice,
and in fact such necessary
particulars as will enable me 
to lay the matter clearly before
people who might become purchasers.</p>

<p>There are no means here of
preserving food and liquids
and if the cost does not bar the
<unclear>way</unclear>, the introduction of refrigerators
would be a boon to many, as meat
turns bad here in twenty four hours.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Ed Bannister.<lb/>
Acting Vice Consul.</p>
