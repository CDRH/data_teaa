No 842

<ab>
Kayes, October 9th 1894

The governor of French
Sudan to Mister Minister of the
Colonies.

<p>
Mister Minister,

I have the honor to
transmit to you enclosed a copy of a
dispatch from the Commander of the Region
of the south dated from the 1st of October.
</p>

<p>
"Three whites giving themselves
for the american missionaries of
the International Missionary alliance have just
arrived in Faranah. They will be part
of a station of their order established
in the Timené province of Sierra Leone
and received as mission of
their superior to come research on
our territory the favorable points
for the establishment of a new station.
These individuals have no paper
establishing their identity. They claim
that the Consul of France in Free-Town
declared to their superior that their
establishment on our territory"
</p>

<ab>
<supplied>Arrived</supplied> in the south region
three whites giving themselves
<supplied>on</supplied> the american missionaries.
</ab>

<pb facs="20160615_122130.jpg"/>

<p>
"did not present any difficulty and engaged
him to write to the President of
the society in New York so that he
demands to the French government
the necessary authorization. This autorization
had not arrived when the three white
missionnaries left their station
to come to our territory. They
are waiting in Franah your decision
on the subject of the possibility to found
a station in the country. I pray
to you Mr. Governor to
address to me your instructions on this subject."
</p>

<p>
Not having received any
communication from the department, I
prayed by telegram on the 6th of the current month
to the Commander of the south Region
to inform the american missionaries
that they had total freedom to circulate
in Sudan, but that I could not
not allow them to establish a religious mission there.
</p>

<p>
In effect, the Colony is
public company by the ordannance of September 7th
1840 of which article 26 is thus conceived:
"The Governor holds the hand to which
no religious congregation or community
establishes itself in the Colony
and receives novices there without our
special authorization."
</p>

<p>
This article, applying
to french congregations, is all the more so
</p>

<pb facs="20160615_122135.jpg"/>

<p>
applicable to foreign missions.
</p>

<p>
I do not see, for that matter,
any advantage to the establishment of a
station of american missionaries in
Sudan. The presence of these foreigners
can only present inconveniences
in many points of view. I <unclear/> in
consequence an unfavorable opinion on the
demand of which you could be <unclear/>,
for Sudan, by the "International
Missionary Alliance."
</p>

<p>
I am with a profound respect,
Mister Minister,
Your very obediant servant
