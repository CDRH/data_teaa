<ab>Honorable
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform the 
Department of any return May 12th
to Basoko from the Lomami River.
The following is a brief as
count of the manner in which
the Arab Slave dealers have been
driven from this section of the 
Kongo Free State.

Upon my arrival at Basoko
March2nd Commandant Chaltin
informed me he had recieved
orders from Inspector of the 
State, M. Five in the Sankuru 
River to proceed to Bena-
Kamba, in the Lomami River
and commence asperations</ab>

<pb facs="20170614_144014"
<p>against the Arabs who were
supposed to be at that place
in large numbers, and if suc-
cessful to proceed to Tchari
60 miles farther south occu-
py that place, and these re-
turn to Bena Kamba, and
proceed to Riba-Riba. Nothing
was said in This Communication
which could be combined
into an order to arrack any
Arab pasts situated between
Isanghi and Kibonge Com-
mandant Chatlin invited me
to accompany kim, as his guest,
but I preferred first to see
Stanley Falls under Arab rule,
as I had an idea they would
revolt in a few months.</p>   
   
<p>I accepted the invitation to come
on a Steamer leaving a few
weeks after his departure.
He left Basoko for Bena-
Komba March 7th on board
the Steamer "Ville d'anvers" with 
200</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144024"
<p>200 Joediers + 2 Krupp 7.5 omm Canon.</p> 
    
<p>The Steamer "Ville de Buxelles" was
sent to Equator Station, 500 miles
down river to being re-enforcements.
I left for Stanley Falls march
4th and remained until March 17th
when M.Jobback, The President, Kindly
sent me to Basako in the pleau-
"launch" A.I.A. in order to cash the 
"Bruxelles" on her return"</p>
    
<p>During my stay at the Falls
I could see there was a strong 
feeling amongst the Arabs against
the State, and that it only re-
quired a very small thing to 
begin the war against the Govern-
ment.</p>
    
<p>The Vali (or Governor) at the Falls 
Commonly known as Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid.</p>
