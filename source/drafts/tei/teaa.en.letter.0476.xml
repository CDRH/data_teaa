<ab>Honorable
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform the 
Department of any return May 12th
to Basoko from the Lomami River.
The following is a brief as
count of the manner in which
the Arab Slave dealers have been
driven from this section of the 
Kongo Free State.

Upon my arrival at Basoko
March2nd Commandant Chaltin
informed me he had recieved
orders from Inspector of the 
State, M. Five in the Sankuru 
River to proceed to Bena-
Kamba, in the Lomami River
and commence asperations</ab>

<pb facs="20170614_144014"
<p>against the Arabs who were
supposed to be at that place
in large numbers, and if suc-
cessful to proceed to Tchari
60 miles farther south occu-
py that place, and these re-
turn to Bena Kamba, and
proceed to Riba-Riba. Nothing
was said in This Communication
which could be combined
into an order to arrack any
Arab pasts situated between
Isanghi and Kibonge Com-
mandant Chatlin invited me
to accompany kim, as his guest,
but I preferred first to see
Stanley Falls under Arab rule,
as I had an idea they would
revolt in a few months.</p>   
   
<p>I accepted the invitation to come
on a Steamer leaving a few
weeks after his departure.
He left Basoko for Bena-
Komba March 7th on board
the Steamer "Ville d'anvers" with 
200</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144024"
<p>200 Joediers + 2 Krupp 7.5 omm Canon.</p> 
    
<p>The Steamer "Ville de Buxelles" was
sent to Equator Station, 500 miles
down river to being re-enforcements.
I left for Stanley Falls march
4th and remained until March 17th
when M.Jobback, The President, Kindly
sent me to Basako in the pleau-
"launch" A.I.A. in order to cash the 
"Bruxelles" on her return"</p>
    
<p>During my stay at the Falls
I could see there was a strong 
feeling amongst the Arabs against
the State, and that it only re-
quired a very small thing to 
begin the war against the Govern-
ment.</p>
    
<p>The Vali (or Governor) at the Falls 
Commonly known as Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid.
Ben. said Ben. Jama. Marajebe
which means, Rachid, (Ben) son of
said, (Ben) son of Jama Marajebe)
and a nephew of Tippoo Tip was
and a nephew of Tippo Tip was
exceedingly discourtious to me

when</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144031"
<ab>when he learned I intended going
to the Lomani.</ab>   
 
<p>The position he held was a most 
expeditionary one;  he was, by de-
partment of the Governor of the
Kongo Free State, by order of the
auchoutioud in Brussels, Vali of 
Stanley Falls, and received by
salary of six thousand Francs
per anew ($1158.00); he was always
furnished with the uniform of a 
Caplaui Commandant.</p>
    
<p>The reasons given for placing at
the head of government at sanchan
important points a man with so 
notorious a reputation, were, that
he would be able to control all
the arabs of this region and so 
prevent any concentrated attack
against the State posts. As future
events have proved the State were
entirely wrong in their estimate of
the Arab strength.</p>
    
<p>The State had a Resident here,
M. Tobback, who conducted all

the</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144039"    
<p>the affairs of Government and was
Commandant of the Past containing
150 soldiers, situated on the right
bank of the Kongo. (see map marked 
Exhibit "B").</p>    
    
<p>Suppose the population at Stanley
Falls might be put down at 5000,
but it was the greatest Ivory market
in Central Africa. While I was there the
Agent of the Belgian Factory, purchased
in 5 days four (4) tons, worth
in Europe 25,000 Francs (or $4833.00).
per ton J to say nothing of rubber.
We sent down to Stanley Pool aboard
the s.s. Archduchess Thiphanie". 18
tons Ivory and 29 tons rubber all
the result of four months work.</p>    
    
<p>Upon arrival at Basoko Sfound
the "Brussels" not yet arrived, +
was compelled to wait until the 25th
when the cause in. On board were 150
soldiers and one Lieutenant and a 
Sergeant; Immediately the Carpentars were
set to work and a thing farricade
placed entirely aroused her, and on the 27th.

All</p>
   
<pb facs="20170614_144048"   
<p>All being completed we left for
Bena Kauba, having on board
Leuit de Bock, Sergeant Lamers
+myself. 150 soldiers, armed with
Albini Rifers, 45,370 cartridges
provisions for the officers and 10
tons of rice for the men.</p>..
    
<p>Noching of note occurred, while as-
cending the river until March 31st when 
the decapitated body of a woman was
passed, floating down streams. No
cause for this apparent murder could 
be found until that evening the 
steamer stopped at a large village
which was in feawers. Two detach-
ments of soldiers were immediately
made ready to go ashore, as an Arab
raid had evidently been made.

M. de roacks Joak one and I the other
reach went to an end of the town
and as my men started into the bush
they received three shots from the dark-
ness of the forest; we charged the pre-
firing three valleys white on the rest
but could see nothing as might had 

fallen.</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144056"
<p>fallen, so returned to the steamer. On
the way back found eight bodies
of women and children, all headless
and some with their legs and
arms gone. Mr. de Bock found in
the Banana plantation two children
and an old woman, who, after
some hours, were persuaded to let
us what had occurred.</p>   
    
<p>It seems the village had been
attacked by a party of Arab slave
hunters about 3 o'clock that
afternoon. They had captured 
over a hundred of the in habi-
tants, and were engaged in des-
troying the Joen when the steamer
came in sight. They retreated im
mediately, and the shots I received
were probably fired by the rear
guard.</p>
    
<p>The next morning we followed their
rail some 3 or 4 miles back found
the bodies of 20 persons men, women
+ children, who were too young, old or 
inform to march rapidly, so

had</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144103"
<p>had been murdered in order to allow 
the caraven to retreat as fast as 
possible.</p>   
   
<p>As we had orders to proceed
with all despatch and join Com-
mandant Chaltin at Bena. Kamba
M. de Bocko did not consider him-
self justified in pursuing farther
the enemy.</p>   
    
<p>Such seems as this village pre-
sented were afterwards of not unfre-
quent occurence.</p>
    
<p>April 10th another body was
passed, but no xause for teach
could be discovered.</p>
    
<p>The Steamer arrived at Bema-
Kamba the next day, and instead of 
finding a great number of Arabs,
who were supposed to be fortfied
here, nothing was to be seen but 
the ruins of the Past established by
the State some years ago. This place
was occupied lasy years ago. This place
was occupied last year as the 
Headquarters of the Company known
as the "Kalanga Lyndicate, of which

Mr</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144110"
<p>Mr. Hodistin was the chief, and
was destroyed by the Arabs at the 
same time they murdered him and
his Expedition while on the way to
Riba-Riba.</p>
    
<p>Here we found letters directing the
steamers to come to Lhome, 20 miles
farther up. We left immediately and
after a day and a half arrived
the S.S. Villa d'anvers" was here, +
the Captain gave us Commandant
Chaltins orders to march without 
delay to Tchain + join him.</p>  
    
<p>We left the next morning, + that
afternoon encountered the Commandant
returning. He had been most-success-
ful defeating the Arabs m an open
fight, and completely destroying
the town of Jchari, which consisted
of 1200 houses and 15000 people
two days later both steamers after
for Bena Kamba, where the Expedition
was to be re-organized for its
March to Riba-Riba, through a 
section of country said to be defeuded

by</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144123"
<ab>by a coting body of arabs.</ab>
    
<p>Small pay had appeared amongst
the soldiers and porters one white
officer, Mr. Coppee also had it. The 
Surgeon Dr. Dupont had a bad
case of dysentery, so, as the "Villa
d' Anvers" was leaving for Basko
in a few days it was decided to 
send these two offices back.</p>
    
<p>March 21st we left Bena Kamba

<p>As the men were armed with the albini
Rifle and carried 100 cartridges. Besides
this ammunition 40 boxes, each containing 160
cartridges were distributed, this brought 
our ammunintion supply up to 34,600
cartridges.</p>
    
<p>Fifty men of at Company "B" each
carried a shell or canister shot for 
the Cannon, and for the carriages of the 
piece I distrubted the Porters as follows:
12 men for cannon, weight 230 lbs in 
3 details.
12 men for the carriage weight 240 lbs
in 3 details.

man carried his own rice cufforont for
10 days as we expected to find food 
for them on the road.</p>   
    
<p>I would state in explanation of
my having command of the cannon. The 
officer who had been desimated for 
this command was sent back to Ba-
soko ill with the small fox. This made 
one affair short, so I tendered any ser-
vices + They were accepted by the Com-
mandant in the following terms;-

"Accepts the services which M. R.Dorsey

Lhoms, April 19th, 1890
(2nd) L. Chaltin."-
(See Appendix "A" for French Copy)--
The first days March was a 

short</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144148"
<p>short one, as we started late. Two 
cases of small pox apperance that might
+ the men were immediately sent bacl
to the Steamer, which was to stop
at Bena-Kamba until written in-
structions to the contray were given
by Commandant Chaltin.</p>
    
<p>The next morning all were on the 
move at daybreak. At 11 a.m. the 
Vauguard were attacked by natives
and in a few minutes the wholle column
were engaged. Posioned arrow simply
rowed and strange to say no one 
was struck, but one of the Corporals
had a most narrow escape,-an arrow
burying itself 1/2 an inch in the stock of
his rifle. The grass being six or seven
feet high it was impossible to
locate the natives, the fighting therefore
was all on their side, while we
amused ourselves dodging arrows which 
it say the least was not a pleasant
occupation.
The next day crossed many large plains 
the soft black mud throughout their 

entire</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144157"
<p>entire length being 1/2 foot deep ren-
dered walking very different and 
progress slow. In one of these plains
natives appeared with palm branches
in their hands as a sign of peace.
They had heard of an approach
and asked for protection from the 
Arabs, who had been raiding, mur-
dering and pillaging in this section
for years. Two guides for Riba-Riba
were given, whicch to our force, but 
these men, evidently thinking we were
too weak to fight so many people
as the Arabs had, dessented two days
afterwards.</p>
    
<p>On the 24th the Welu River was
reached, but the water being too high
no ford was found, However all
hands set to work and in two days 
a bridge 600 feet long + one wide
was completed. On the morning of the
26th all passed over in fine order.
At mid-day the village of + Kamba
was reached. This is the place

where</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144252"
<p>where. Hodiders Expedition was massacered.
Nothing was found in any way connected
with this informante affair.</p>
    
<p>The Arabs had deserted I Kamba prob-
ably in March. All the houses to the number 
of 300 were in excellent condition but
all removable articles had been taken
away by their owners. We lost a soldier
here; he received a posioned aarow in his 
head, but before falling shot the native
who threw the arrow. Death was almost instantaneous.</p>
    
<p>This posion is deadly in the effect
and I have heard of one relatable method
to counteract into effect. This made
from old urine which is placed in an
earthen ware pot and exposed to the 
rayo of the on for three days. During
the time of exposure small red ants are
pounded into a powder until about 3
ounces have been collected. This powder
is the poured into the pot and the mess
boiled for three hours, when it has
attained the cnsistency of molasses it
is ready for use, the amount required
for three of four days is carried in a 

slinsling</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144312"
<ab>sling at the side. The arrow is dipped in 
and shot dripping.</ab>
    
<p>That afternoon the entire town was
burned and destroyed, and at 4
p.m. we left for the small village 
of N'bonbon +camped for the night,
A cheerful sight greeted us upon
entering this place; the chief of the 
District who has the extraordinary 
name of Equansalanmonated, being 
an ally of the Arabs, had palced
directly across the road sixteen newly
cut heads (of natives), probably as a 
warning to us what our fate
would be if we proceeded farther.
By directiom of the Commandant they 
were buried in the bush.</p>
    
<p>Small pox had now assumed serious pro-
portion, some 30 cases having appeared
of course it was out of the question 
to think of leaving these people at
any pint on the road, as they would 
have been killed by the enemy, so 
we were compelled to take then 
with us.

March</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144318"
<p>March 29th progress was stopped
by arriving on the edge of what ap-
peared to be an immense 2 warrants.
Men were sent in different directions
to fuid a crossing place, Lalfan
hour afterwards they returned having 
found a road, which led to a 
river which was broad and swift.
and impossible to cross without a 
raft or boats. They were sent back
to look for a better place, but 
soon came back reporting that a 
large armed force of Arabs were
on the other side preparing to cross.
Preparations were immediately commenced
to attack. A force of men under Lt. de
Bock was sent to the night; a mild
force under Captain Marck to the left-
Sergeants Nahan +Lamers took up
the centre and the cannon was con-
veyed to a point which I considered
about 900 feet diagonally appoints
the centre of the Arab position. All
was quiet amongst our men. The 
enemy had not discovered our presence

and</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144325"   
<ab>and were creating the most frightful
row in their camp. Horns blowing,
Toms beating men yelling orders, women
screeching and children crying. They
had three canoes + the first load 
started for the other side where 
Captain Marek was waiting for 
them. Not one escaped. Of course
This was the signal, and the forming
because general all along our line 
which extended a mile along the 
river. Receiving orders from the Com-
mandant I placed one shell in the 
centre of the camp. This was the only
shot fired, as they shifted their pposiion
+ we could not transport the cannon
to a favorable place. Commandant
Chaltin coming up at this moment ordered
me to leave the piece in charge of 
a sergeant + 25 soldiers, and to go 
with him to a place he had found 
directly opposite the camp. Two sol-
diers were with us and we apened
fire with deadly effect. When are
position was discovered we received their 

whole</ab>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144332"
<p>whole fire. Bullets, slug, beads, and 
pieces of brass rads seemed to hail
but no one was wounded. After 
three hours they withdrew and 
our camp was made in an open 
space near the river back, and in 
such a position it could not
be attacked suddenly. The roll 
was called to account for dead
and wounded, but we found that
only one man had a slight bullet
wound in his leg. Considering the 
heavy fire we had been exposed
to it seems extraordinary that
such could be the case.</p>  
    
<p>Some of the men accompanied by 
me, swam the river, and reconnected
the place, but we could not find 
an Arab, dead or alive. The bush 
was covered with blood, but all
the bodies had been removed, which 
is a custom of these people if cir-
cumstances permit.</p>
    
<p>THe next morning the construction
of a raft was commenced and late

that</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144338"
<ab> that might all being finished preparations 
were at once commenced to cross in the 
morning.</ab>
    
<p>Lt. Boak all day to send over 150 men
as only 5 at a time could be carried.
When this member was reached it 
was decided to send them to Riba-
Riba (3 hours distant) + to return as 
soon as the mission had been accom-
plished. Headquarters were established
on the backs of the Kassaku River.</p>
    
<p>Previous to the departure of this 
detachment, a couciln was "held to 
discuss the advisability of establish-
ing a post at Riba-Riba. It was 
decided impracticable on account of 
the small pox being an epideimic (130 
men having the disease). The Commandant
was afraid to put so many arms 
+ so  much ammunition in the centre of 
the enemy's country, with the chance of 
all the gattidon dying of the disease, thus allowing
valuable stoves to fall in the hands
of the Arabs.</p>
    
<p>We were to go to Riba-Riba

do</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144345"
<ab> do what we could and return to 
Kassuku, when the route for Bena-
Kamba would be taken.</ab>
    
<p>Riba-Riba was found to be on 
large town, well situated and said 
out. In front of chief M. Genera's
house two right hands, belonging
to white men were found tied to 
the flag staff. They probably be
longed to messro. M. Chief+  Noblesse
who were murdered here last year.
The- place was deserted, not even
a native being seen. In a short time
everything was in flames, and we 
both up the return march to camp
which was reached at 1 A.M.</p>
    
<p>May 1st all sick were sent; under
a quard, back to Benas Kamba
and on the 2nd the remainder of
the Expedition left. We travelled
10 hours of a day reaching the 
Steamer May 5th at 2p.m. making
the return journey in 3 days. It took 
us 9 days to go"</p>
    
<p>The scenes on the road going back 

were</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144354"
<ab>were awful; the dead from the 
sick, column buring it every
mile. In many cases one would
fall over a corpse, concealed by
the high grass, and the stench from 
the dead, who had succumbed
on our march to Kassaka, was
overpowering.</ab>  
    
<p>Thirty cases appeared with us 
and they had to make the best-
of their way back there being 
absoultely no method by which 
we could assist them.</p>
    
<p>Upon our return + the roll being 
called our total  number was
401 persons, 104 having died in 
less than three weeks.</p>
    
<p>All the sick were placed in two 
large steel boats and sent down
never under charge of a corporal +
four soldiers.</p>

its section of the country confessions of 
eternal friendship were made on both
Jedev.</p>
    
<p>Two hours after our departure a canal
carrying the Kongo flag was met; when 
the cause alongside a Koussa Corporal cause 
any board+ handed M. Chatlin a letter 
from the President ar Stanley Falls, ad-
dressed to the Station of Basoko Bangals
+ Equator He. stated that the Arab had been 
threatening for two days + at any moment
expected an attack on the station, and 
requested assistance immediately for id at-
tacked he could not hold out for more 
than eight days.</p>
   
<p>It was decided to go on to Bauoko, land 
all seek disenfect the steamer and leave
for the Falls as soon as possible with a 
new  lot of men to take the please of 
those who had did or were ill.

All</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144408"
<p>All was completed on the 14th and,
at 9AM we left having on board
250 soldiers, 60,000 rounds of ammun-
ition, and 70 rounds for the cannon.
That night camp was made at the 
small state past of Moango, which has 
a garrison of one Corporal and 6 soldiers
with about 20 auxilliaries in the Shape 
of natives armed with muzzle-loading
guns. They had been attacked on the 13th
by a force of Arabs in eleven canoes, but 
these few men killed 10 and wounded 
15 of these, after an hours fighting the 
enemy drew off.</p>
   
<p>Passed Isanghi the next morning but 
made no demonstration, as the Commandant 
had received no information from the Falls
stating that actual warfare had began.
We all thought war might possibly be 
averted so did not care to precipitate-
trouble by attacking Abi-Bou.</p>
    
<p>On the 17th when opposite the Arab Poet
of Yafaka, the steamer "AIA" was met
with letters on board for down river.
The Arabs had commenced the fifty on

<p>Being oppositw two big Arab stations we
attacked, captured + destryoed them, 
and at 3p.m. took up the route,
but were usable to reach the Falls that 
night. The camp was made three hours
below, and a canoe sent immediately to 
M. Tobback saying everything was all
right and we would be with him
in the morning early.</p>
    
<p>Left at 4 am and in the gray must
of the morning came off the Belgiam 
Factory (which had been captured + heavenly
palsaded by the Arabs) The follow-
ing order had been given by the Commandant 
(Teauslation)- "Order."</p>

<p>Commandant Commanding 
These orders were fully carried out upon
arrival off the Factory we recieved a hearth 
fire, but no one was touched. A few 
mintues afterwards we landed, and fair min-
tues after the steamer was made fact the 
cannon had been mounted and the first
shell dropped into the Factory, range 2400
feet. At the 12th shot the steamer went 

to</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144432"    
<ab>to the other-side + the men carried the-
position at the point of the bayonets; killing
or driving all from the Factory . Double time
was these made for the Arab town.</ab>
    
<p>While this was going on I had opened
fire (at 4800 feet) on the house of 
Rachid. By the time 15 shell had been drop-
ped in various places the moops arrived
and the place was taken with very little
resistance. The Arabs were in full retreat
with the soldiers in hot pursuit, but know-
ing all the paths + by-ways of the forest 
the majority escaped. Rashid, with 
several chiefs got away in a large
canoe. It is estimated that their loss 
was 200 at least.</p>
    
<p>In the meantime 150 soldiers had
taken the town on the night bank, killing
the chief and some 75 of his men.</p>
    
<p>The Arabs at the Falls were so confident
of success. (Knowing Comat. Chaltin was in
the Lomami + that it would take at least
a month to being Soldiers from down river)

Amongst the articles captured I might men-

50 guns, rifles + smoothbore;
2000 pieces of cloths, and reusable matress
beaunets, fernouses, and long white liner
shirts without numbers. The cloth on were
all turned over to the soldiers as a re-
ward for their fine conduct during the 
past few months.</p>
    
<p>That afternoon a message came to the 
President stating many slaves, soldiers, women
+ belonging to the Arabs hurried to give
themselves up. The first lot consisting of 
men, women, +children, numbered of
225 guns were taken from them. During 
the next two days, 1600 more gave 
themselves up; This represents a loss of
2000 people to the Arabs and is an severe
strain on their resources.</p>
    
<p>I witnesed many extraordinary scenes 
whilst receiving these people. A great

many</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144455"
<p>many of the soldiers found fathers, mothers,
brothers, or sisters amongst the slaves, and 
some of the meeting and recognitions were
really affecting. These slaves had been
taken some four years ago during a
big raid in the ouelle. Bomakandi Imm-
biry + Likali Rivers. These raids are 
furnished now as the state have troops
+ cattered all through the country. All
the Arab soldiers have expressed a decure
will be gratified, but they will not be
allowed to fight against the Arabs,
for some time. Probably the Government
will station them in the southern+ western points
of the State, where the natives give much 
trouble.</p>
  
<p>There being no more danger from the 
Arabs we left the Falls on the 22nd +
that afternoon arrived off Yataka, where
the fight of the 17th, took place). There 
was guest a thick fog at the time and
the banks were hardly visible. Knowing
that behind a large Arab town named
Romi existed, the pleasure was burned

Mr. Few inspector of the State, and Commandant
Daenen upon arrival off Yataka, on this 
way to the Falls, found the place heavily

soldiers + had also taken Romie.</p>
    
<p>Romie was a large town, and supplied the

It might be called a large agricultural
settlement having some 3000 acres under
ailtivation (see map Exhibit C.) The loss
was quite heavy and the natives who
swarmed like vultures over the whole
please, began cutting bodies up to eat,
but Commandant Laltin had given orders
that it was not to be permitted, and any 
Native seen with human flesh in his pos-
session was to be shot. I saw several
natives carrying arms + legs down to the 
beach, but a bullet soon put an end
to these proceedings. They say they 

do</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144546"
<p>do not eat human flesh on account
of a liking for it, but as the Arabs
were theur enemies, they gain all the 
strength possessed by them where they 
eat the meat.</p>
    
<p>Both steamers left for Stanley Falls
next morning, after burning Rome.
at the Falls the following order was
published:- (French copy marked District D.).

(2) L Chaltiri
Chief of th Expedition 
Against Riba-Riba and 
Stanley Falls.</p>

<p>The following is a brief history of the 
events which have led up to this war:-
It is undoubtedly a fact that the
many reverses the Arabs had met with
at the hands of the Van Keickhoen Ex-
pedition in the ouelle+ Bomakandi Puerss
+ the large number killed and quantity 
of Ivory captured had engendered a 
feeling of hatred against the whites.
This found an outlet in thr massacre
of the Hadister Expedition in May 1892
mercial Factories were to be established.
They also murdered the State Agent 
at Riba-Riba Lieut. Michels.

In</p>

<pb facs="20170614_144638"
<p>In December, 1892 Lieut. Shamis, 
Commandant of the Camp at Lusambe 
in the Lankuru, allied himself with 
Congo Liutete, a former slave of Tippo
Tibes. This man id a native, of the 
Manyema country and had been,
given his freedom +placed in charge
of a large district in the Lomami by
Lippo Tib as a reward for past services ,
but he decided to become a vassal
of the Stat, renounced his allegiance
to his former master and with all
his people (10,000) passed over to 
the, Kongo Free State, Sef Ben Hamed 
Ben Jama Marajebe, son of Tippo-Tib
+ his representative for the whole of 
Central Africa, residing at Kassongo 
when he heard of this decided to pun-
ish him. He left Kassaongo with 5000
oldiers in December + commenced his 
much to the Lomami. Naturally as
Congo-Lahete had placed himself with 
all his men and guns (4000) at the 
disposition of the State M. Dhamis.
immediately went to him and they defeated 

Sef.</p>

<pb facs="20170614_144645"
<p>Sef. killing 500,-- capturing 600+
5 chiefs  and 1000 guns: Since that
time M. Dhanis actions have been
continuous and he has occupied the 
most important Arab towns in Central 
Africa, Nyamgwe +Kasongo. The total
population of these two places, including 
enverons was 40,000.</p>

<p>Kassongo is situated in 40.00 Bank
260 45' East (approximately) was the property 
of Tippo Tib.</p>

<p>Nyangwe some 40 miles N.W. of Kassongo 
did not belong to Tipo Tip, but was
under the rule of Mani-Mohar. This 
man ordered the murder of the Hodistin
party: ole has been captured and hanged
by M. Dhamis.</p>

<p>At Kassongo the State had two white 
men Messrs. Lipens de Bruya; as Agents,
who were murdered immediately upon
the return of Sef. form his defeat in 
the Lomami.</p>

<p>The Arabs are now in a demmoralized
condition. The only post of any im-
portance held by them is Kebongs,

90</p>

<pb facs="20170614_144651"
<p>90 miles south of Stanley Falls on the right 
bank of the Loualaba (kongo). an Expedition
under command at Captain Panther, consisting 
of 400 soldiers, and 2 Krupp Cannon has 
been sent there and by this time the place
is captured. The Arabs muster at least 8000
guns.</p>

<p>It is the general of men that the slaves 
of the Kongo State will make Tonganyka
Their objective point, with after in German
Territory on the N.E. side their headquarters.
The authorities of the State Government
are to be congrahuliated upon their suc-
cess in driving these murderers and robbers 
from what was undoubtedly their most
profitable fields. They have for many 
years made life a living hell for
the natives, over an extent of territory
covering more than 300,000 square miles,
and if the English and German au-
thoritiess on the East- Coast will take
measures to stop, absolutely, the sale 
of gun powder it is only a question of 
a few years when we would see the 
slave trade dying a matured death.

I</p>

<pb facs="20170614-144659"
<p>I am certain all the powder, cartridges and
guns captured at Stanley Falls and Rome
cause from the East.

The marks on the powder and cartridges
were as follows:

<p>The one man who controls most of the 
slave traders of Central Africa is Hamed
Ben Mohammed. Ben Juma Marajebe
(better kn own as Tippo Tib) and the fol
lowing places were absolutely under his 
control:-

Kassongo- Chief Buana Makubua, (Buana

I can find no other name for this 
Arab)-
