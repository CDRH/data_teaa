<ab>Honorable
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform the 
Department of any return May 12th
to Basoko from the Lomami River.
The following is a brief as
count of the manner in which
the Arab Slave dealers have been
driven from this section of the 
Kongo Free State.

Upon my arrival at Basoko
March2nd Commandant Chaltin
informed me he had recieved
orders from Inspector of the 
State, M. Five in the Sankuru 
River to proceed to Bena-
Kamba, in the Lomami River
and commence asperations</ab>

<pb facs="20170614_144014"
<p>against the Arabs who were
supposed to be at that place
in large numbers, and if suc-
cessful to proceed to Tchari
60 miles farther south occu-
py that place, and these re-
turn to Bena Kamba, and
proceed to Riba-Riba. Nothing
was said in This Communication
which could be combined
into an order to arrack any
Arab pasts situated between
Isanghi and Kibonge Com-
mandant Chatlin invited me
to accompany kim, as his guest,
but I preferred first to see
Stanley Falls under Arab rule,
as I had an idea they would
revolt in a few months.</p>   
   
<p>I accepted the invitation to come
on a Steamer leaving a few
weeks after his departure.
He left Basoko for Bena-
Komba March 7th on board
the Steamer "Ville d'anvers" with 
200</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144024"
<p>200 Joediers + 2 Krupp 7.5 omm Canon.</p> 
    
<p>The Steamer "Ville de Buxelles" was
sent to Equator Station, 500 miles
down river to being re-enforcements.
I left for Stanley Falls march
4th and remained until March 17th
when M.Jobback, The President, Kindly
sent me to Basako in the pleau-
"launch" A.I.A. in order to cash the 
"Bruxelles" on her return"</p>
    
<p>During my stay at the Falls
I could see there was a strong 
feeling amongst the Arabs against
the State, and that it only re-
quired a very small thing to 
begin the war against the Govern-
ment.</p>
    
<p>The Vali (or Governor) at the Falls 
Commonly known as Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid.
Ben. said Ben. Jama. Marajebe
which means, Rachid, (Ben) son of
said, (Ben) son of Jama Marajebe)
and a nephew of Tippoo Tip was
and a nephew of Tippo Tip was
exceedingly discourtious to me

when</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144031"
<ab>when he learned I intended going
to the Lomani.</ab>   
 
<p>The position he held was a most 
expeditionary one;  he was, by de-
partment of the Governor of the
Kongo Free State, by order of the
auchoutioud in Brussels, Vali of 
Stanley Falls, and received by
salary of six thousand Francs
per anew ($1158.00); he was always
furnished with the uniform of a 
Caplaui Commandant.</p>
    
<p>The reasons given for placing at
the head of government at sanchan
important points a man with so 
notorious a reputation, were, that
he would be able to control all
the arabs of this region and so 
prevent any concentrated attack
against the State posts. As future
events have proved the State were
entirely wrong in their estimate of
the Arab strength.</p>
    
<p>The State had a Resident here,
M. Tobback, who conducted all

the</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144039"    
<p>the affairs of Government and was
Commandant of the Past containing
150 soldiers, situated on the right
bank of the Kongo. (see map marked 
Exhibit "B").</p>    
    
<p>Suppose the population at Stanley
Falls might be put down at 5000,
but it was the greatest Ivory market
in Central Africa. While I was there the
Agent of the Belgian Factory, purchased
in 5 days four (4) tons, worth
in Europe 25,000 Francs (or $4833.00).
per ton J to say nothing of rubber.
We sent down to Stanley Pool aboard
the s.s. Archduchess Thiphanie". 18
tons Ivory and 29 tons rubber all
the result of four months work.</p>    
    
<p>Upon arrival at Basoko Sfound
the "Brussels" not yet arrived, +
was compelled to wait until the 25th
when the cause in. On board were 150
soldiers and one Lieutenant and a 
Sergeant; Immediately the Carpentars were
set to work and a thing farricade
placed entirely aroused her, and on the 27th.

All</p>
   
<pb facs="20170614_144048"   
<p>All being completed we left for
Bena Kauba, having on board
Leuit de Bock, Sergeant Lamers
+myself. 150 soldiers, armed with
Albini Rifers, 45,370 cartridges
provisions for the officers and 10
tons of rice for the men.</p>..
    
<p>Noching of note occurred, while as-
cending the river until March 31st when 
the decapitated body of a woman was
passed, floating down streams. No
cause for this apparent murder could 
be found until that evening the 
steamer stopped at a large village
which was in feawers. Two detach-
ments of soldiers were immediately
made ready to go ashore, as an Arab
raid had evidently been made.

M. de roacks Joak one and I the other
reach went to an end of the town
and as my men started into the bush
they received three shots from the dark-
ness of the forest; we charged the pre-
firing three valleys white on the rest
but could see nothing as might had 

fallen.</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144056"
<p>fallen, so returned to the steamer. On
the way back found eight bodies
of women and children, all headless
and some with their legs and
arms gone. Mr. de Bock found in
the Banana plantation two children
and an old woman, who, after
some hours, were persuaded to let
us what had occurred.</p>   
    
<p>It seems the village had been
attacked by a party of Arab slave
hunters about 3 o'clock that
afternoon. They had captured 
over a hundred of the in habi-
tants, and were engaged in des-
troying the Joen when the steamer
came in sight. They retreated im
mediately, and the shots I received
were probably fired by the rear
guard.</p>
    
<p>The next morning we followed their
rail some 3 or 4 miles back found
the bodies of 20 persons men, women
+ children, who were too young, old or 
inform to march rapidly, so

had</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144103"
<p>had been murdered in order to allow 
the caraven to retreat as fast as 
possible.</p>   
   
<p>As we had orders to proceed
with all despatch and join Com-
mandant Chaltin at Bena. Kamba
M. de Bocko did not consider him-
self justified in pursuing farther
the enemy.</p>   
    
<p>Such seems as this village pre-
sented were afterwards of not unfre-
quent occurence.</p>
    
<p>April 10th another body was
passed, but no xause for teach
could be discovered.</p>
    
<p>The Steamer arrived at Bema-
Kamba the next day, and instead of 
finding a great number of Arabs,
who were supposed to be fortfied
here, nothing was to be seen but 
the ruins of the Past established by
the State some years ago. This place
was occupied lasy years ago. This place
was occupied last year as the 
Headquarters of the Company known
as the "Kalanga Lyndicate, of which

Mr</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144110"
<p>Mr. Hodistin was the chief, and
was destroyed by the Arabs at the 
same time they murdered him and
his Expedition while on the way to
Riba-Riba.</p>
    
<p>Here we found letters directing the
steamers to come to Lhome, 20 miles
farther up. We left immediately and
after a day and a half arrived
the S.S. Villa d'anvers" was here, +
the Captain gave us Commandant
Chaltins orders to march without 
delay to Tchain + join him.</p>  
    
<p>We left the next morning, + that
afternoon encountered the Commandant
returning. He had been most-success-
ful defeating the Arabs m an open
fight, and completely destroying
the town of Jchari, which consisted
of 1200 houses and 15000 people
two days later both steamers after
for Bena Kamba, where the Expedition
was to be re-organized for its
March to Riba-Riba, through a 
section of country said to be defeuded

by</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144123"
<ab>by a coting body of arabs.</ab>
    
<p>Small pay had appeared amongst
the soldiers and porters one white
officer, Mr. Coppee also had it. The 
Surgeon Dr. Dupont had a bad
case of dysentery, so, as the "Villa
d' Anvers" was leaving for Basko
in a few days it was decided to 
send these two offices back.</p>
    
<p>March 21st we left Bena Kamba

<p>As the men were armed with the albini
Rifle and carried 100 cartridges. Besides
this ammunition 40 boxes, each containing 160
cartridges were distributed, this brought 
our ammunintion supply up to 34,600
cartridges.</p>
    
<p>Fifty men of at Company "B" each
carried a shell or canister shot for 
the Cannon, and for the carriages of the 
piece I distrubted the Porters as follows:
12 men for cannon, weight 230 lbs in 
3 details.
12 men for the carriage weight 240 lbs
in 3 details.
4 men for 2 wheels, weight 50lbs each

The luggage consisted of 3 double

man carried his own rice cufforont for
10 days as we expected to find food 
for them on the road.</p>   
    
<p>I would state in explanation of
my having command of the cannon. The 
officer who had been desimated for 
this command was sent back to Ba-
soko ill with the small fox. This made 
one affair short, so I tendered any ser-
vices + They were accepted by the Com-
mandant in the following terms;-
-Translation-

"The Commissary of the Arumimu- Ouelle
"District on mission in the Lomemi-
"Accepts the services which M. R.Dorsey
"Mohew offers voluntarily, and charges

"tillery Section of the Expedition"=
Lhoms, April 19th, 1890
(2nd) L. Chaltin."-
(See Appendix "A" for French Copy)--
The first days March was a 

short</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144148"
<p>short one, as we started late. Two 
cases of small pox apperance that might
+ the men were immediately sent bacl
to the Steamer, which was to stop
at Bena-Kamba until written in-
structions to the contray were given
by Commandant Chaltin.</p>
    
<p>The next morning all were on the 
move at daybreak. At 11 a.m. the 
Vauguard were attacked by natives
and in a few minutes the wholle column
were engaged. Posioned arrow simply
rowed and strange to say no one 
was struck, but one of the Corporals
had a most narrow escape,-an arrow
burying itself 1/2 an inch in the stock of
his rifle. The grass being six or seven
feet high it was impossible to
locate the natives, the fighting therefore
was all on their side, while we
amused ourselves dodging arrows which 
it say the least was not a pleasant
occupation.
The next day crossed many large plains 
the soft black mud throughout their 

entire</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144157"
<p>entire length being 1/2 foot deep ren-
dered walking very different and 
progress slow. In one of these plains
natives appeared with palm branches
in their hands as a sign of peace.
They had heard of an approach
and asked for protection from the 
Arabs, who had been raiding, mur-
dering and pillaging in this section
for years. Two guides for Riba-Riba
were given, whicch to our force, but 
these men, evidently thinking we were
too weak to fight so many people
as the Arabs had, dessented two days
afterwards.</p>
    
<p>On the 24th the Welu River was
reached, but the water being too high
no ford was found, However all
hands set to work and in two days 
a bridge 600 feet long + one wide
was completed. On the morning of the
26th all passed over in fine order.
At mid-day the village of + Kamba
was reached. This is the place

where</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144252"
<p>where. Hodiders Expedition was massacered.
Nothing was found in any way connected
with this informante affair.</p>
    
<p>The Arabs had deserted I Kamba prob-
ably in March. All the houses to the number 
of 300 were in excellent condition but
all removable articles had been taken
away by their owners. We lost a soldier
here; he received a posioned aarow in his 
head, but before falling shot the native
who threw the arrow. Death was almost instantaneous.</p>
    
<p>This posion is deadly in the effect
and I have heard of one relatable method
to counteract into effect. This made
from old urine which is placed in an
earthen ware pot and exposed to the 
rayo of the on for three days. During
the time of exposure small red ants are
pounded into a powder until about 3
ounces have been collected. This powder
is the poured into the pot and the mess
boiled for three hours, when it has
attained the cnsistency of molasses it
is ready for use, the amount required
for three of four days is carried in a 

slinsling</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144312"
<ab>sling at the side. The arrow is dipped in 
and shot dripping.</ab>
    
<p>That afternoon the entire town was
burned and destroyed, and at 4
p.m. we left for the small village 
of N'bonbon +camped for the night,
A cheerful sight greeted us upon
entering this place; the chief of the 
District who has the extraordinary 
name of Equansalanmonated, being 
an ally of the Arabs, had palced
directly across the road sixteen newly
cut heads (of natives), probably as a 
warning to us what our fate
would be if we proceeded farther.
By directiom of the Commandant they 
were buried in the bush.</p>
    
<p>Small pox had now assumed serious pro-
portion, some 30 cases having appeared
of course it was out of the question 
to think of leaving these people at
any pint on the road, as they would 
have been killed by the enemy, so 
we were compelled to take then 
with us.

March</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144318"
<p>March 29th progress was stopped
by arriving on the edge of what ap-
peared to be an immense 2 warrants.
Men were sent in different directions
to fuid a crossing place, Lalfan
hour afterwards they returned having 
found a road, which led to a 
river which was broad and swift.
and impossible to cross without a 
raft or boats. They were sent back
to look for a better place, but 
soon came back reporting that a 
large armed force of Arabs were
on the other side preparing to cross.
Preparations were immediately commenced
to attack. A force of men under Lt. de
Bock was sent to the night; a mild
force under Captain Marck to the left-
Sergeants Nahan +Lamers took up
the centre and the cannon was con-
veyed to a point which I considered
about 900 feet diagonally appoints
the centre of the Arab position. All
was quiet amongst our men. The 
enemy had not discovered our presence

and</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144325"   
<ab>and were creating the most frightful
row in their camp. Horns blowing,
Toms beating men yelling orders, women
screeching and children crying. They
had three canoes + the first load 
started for the other side where 
Captain Marek was waiting for 
them. Not one escaped. Of course
This was the signal, and the forming
because general all along our line 
which extended a mile along the 
river. Receiving orders from the Com-
mandant I placed one shell in the 
centre of the camp. This was the only
shot fired, as they shifted their pposiion
+ we could not transport the cannon
to a favorable place. Commandant
Chaltin coming up at this moment ordered
me to leave the piece in charge of 
a sergeant + 25 soldiers, and to go 
with him to a place he had found 
directly opposite the camp. Two sol-
diers were with us and we apened
fire with deadly effect. When are
position was discovered we received their 

whole</ab>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144332"
<p>whole fire. Bullets, slug, beads, and 
pieces of brass rads seemed to hail
but no one was wounded. After 
three hours they withdrew and 
our camp was made in an open 
space near the river back, and in 
such a position it could not
be attacked suddenly. The roll 
was called to account for dead
and wounded, but we found that
only one man had a slight bullet
wound in his leg. Considering the 
heavy fire we had been exposed
to it seems extraordinary that
such could be the case.</p>  
    
<p>Some of the men accompanied by 
me, swam the river, and reconnected
the place, but we could not find 
an Arab, dead or alive. The bush 
was covered with blood, but all
the bodies had been removed, which 
is a custom of these people if cir-
cumstances permit.</p>
    
<p>THe next morning the construction
of a raft was commenced and late

that</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144338"
<ab> that might all being finished preparations 
were at once commenced to cross in the 
morning.</ab>
    
<p>Lt. Boak all day to send over 150 men
as only 5 at a time could be carried.
When this member was reached it 
was decided to send them to Riba-
Riba (3 hours distant) + to return as 
soon as the mission had been accom-
plished. Headquarters were established
on the backs of the Kassaku River.</p>
    
<p>Previous to the departure of this 
detachment, a couciln was "held to 
discuss the advisability of establish-
ing a post at Riba-Riba. It was 
decided impracticable on account of 
the small pox being an epideimic (130 
men having the disease). The Commandant
was afraid to put so many arms 
+ so  much ammunition in the centre of 
the enemy's country, with the chance of 
all the gattidon dying of the disease, thus allowing
valuable stoves to fall in the hands
of the Arabs.</p>
    
<p>We were to go to Riba-Riba

do</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144345"
<ab> do what we could and return to 
Kassuku, when the route for Bena-
Kamba would be taken.</ab>
    
<p>Riba-Riba was found to be on 
large town, well situated and said 
out. In front of chief M. Genera's
house two right hands, belonging
to white men were found tied to 
the flag staff. They probably be
longed to messro. M. Chief+  Noblesse
who were murdered here last year.
The- place was deserted, not even
a native being seen. In a short time
everything was in flames, and we 
both up the return march to camp
which was reached at 1 A.M.</p>
    
<p>May 1st all sick were sent; under
a quard, back to Benas Kamba
and on the 2nd the remainder of
the Expedition left. We travelled
10 hours of a day reaching the 
Steamer May 5th at 2p.m. making
the return journey in 3 days. It took 
us 9 days to go"</p>
    
<p>The scenes on the road going back 

were</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144354"
<ab>were awful; the dead from the 
sick, column buring it every
mile. In many cases one would
fall over a corpse, concealed by
the high grass, and the stench from 
the dead, who had succumbed
on our march to Kassaka, was
overpowering.</ab>  
    
<p>Thirty cases appeared with us 
and they had to make the best-
of their way back there being 
absoultely no method by which 
we could assist them.</p>
    
<p>Upon our return + the roll being 
called our total  number was
401 persons, 104 having died in 
less than three weeks.</p>
    
<p>All the sick were placed in two 
large steel boats and sent down
never under charge of a corporal +
four soldiers.</p>
