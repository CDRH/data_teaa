<ab>Honorable
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform the 
Department of any return May 12th
to Basoko from the Lomami River.
The following is a brief as
count of the manner in which
the Arab Slave dealers have been
driven from this section of the 
Kongo Free State.

Upon my arrival at Basoko
March2nd Commandant Chaltin
informed me he had recieved
orders from Inspector of the 
State, M. Five in the Sankuru 
River to proceed to Bena-
Kamba, in the Lomami River
and commence asperations</ab>

<pb facs="20170614_144014"
<p>against the Arabs who were
supposed to be at that place
in large numbers, and if suc-
cessful to proceed to Tchari
60 miles farther south occu-
py that place, and these re-
turn to Bena Kamba, and
proceed to Riba-Riba. Nothing
was said in This Communication
which could be combined
into an order to arrack any
Arab pasts situated between
Isanghi and Kibonge Com-
mandant Chatlin invited me
to accompany kim, as his guest,
but I preferred first to see
Stanley Falls under Arab rule,
as I had an idea they would
revolt in a few months.</p>   
   
<p>I accepted the invitation to come
on a Steamer leaving a few
weeks after his departure.
He left Basoko for Bena-
Komba March 7th on board
the Steamer "Ville d'anvers" with 
200</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144024"
<p>200 Joediers + 2 Krupp 7.5 omm Canon.</p> 
    
<p>The Steamer "Ville de Buxelles" was
sent to Equator Station, 500 miles
down river to being re-enforcements.
I left for Stanley Falls march
4th and remained until March 17th
when M.Jobback, The President, Kindly
sent me to Basako in the pleau-
"launch" A.I.A. in order to cash the 
"Bruxelles" on her return"</p>
    
<p>During my stay at the Falls
I could see there was a strong 
feeling amongst the Arabs against
the State, and that it only re-
quired a very small thing to 
begin the war against the Govern-
ment.</p>
    
<p>The Vali (or Governor) at the Falls 
Commonly known as Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid,
but whose real name is Rachid.
Ben. said Ben. Jama. Marajebe
which means, Rachid, (Ben) son of
said, (Ben) son of Jama Marajebe)
and a nephew of Tippoo Tip was
and a nephew of Tippo Tip was
exceedingly discourtious to me

when</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144031"
<ab>when he learned I intended going
to the Lomani.</ab>   
 
<p>The position he held was a most 
expeditionary one;  he was, by de-
partment of the Governor of the
Kongo Free State, by order of the
auchoutioud in Brussels, Vali of 
Stanley Falls, and received by
salary of six thousand Francs
per anew ($1158.00); he was always
furnished with the uniform of a 
Caplaui Commandant.</p>
    
<p>The reasons given for placing at
the head of government at sanchan
important points a man with so 
notorious a reputation, were, that
he would be able to control all
the arabs of this region and so 
prevent any concentrated attack
against the State posts. As future
events have proved the State were
entirely wrong in their estimate of
the Arab strength.</p>
    
<p>The State had a Resident here,
M. Tobback, who conducted all

the</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144039"    
<p>the affairs of Government and was
Commandant of the Past containing
150 soldiers, situated on the right
bank of the Kongo. (see map marked 
Exhibit "B").</p>    
    
<p>Suppose the population at Stanley
Falls might be put down at 5000,
but it was the greatest Ivory market
in Central Africa. While I was there the
Agent of the Belgian Factory, purchased
in 5 days four (4) tons, worth
in Europe 25,000 Francs (or $4833.00).
per ton J to say nothing of rubber.
We sent down to Stanley Pool aboard
the s.s. Archduchess Thiphanie". 18
tons Ivory and 29 tons rubber all
the result of four months work.</p>    
    
<p>Upon arrival at Basoko Sfound
the "Brussels" not yet arrived, +
was compelled to wait until the 25th
when the cause in. On board were 150
soldiers and one Lieutenant and a 
Sergeant; Immediately the Carpentars were
set to work and a thing farricade
placed entirely aroused her, and on the 27th.

All</p>
   
<pb facs="20170614_144048"   
<p>All being completed we left for
Bena Kauba, having on board
Leuit de Bock, Sergeant Lamers
+myself. 150 soldiers, armed with
Albini Rifers, 45,370 cartridges
provisions for the officers and 10
tons of rice for the men.</p>..
    
<p>Noching of note occurred, while as-
cending the river until March 31st when 
the decapitated body of a woman was
passed, floating down streams. No
cause for this apparent murder could 
be found until that evening the 
steamer stopped at a large village
which was in feawers. Two detach-
ments of soldiers were immediately
made ready to go ashore, as an Arab
raid had evidently been made.

M. de roacks Joak one and I the other
reach went to an end of the town
and as my men started into the bush
they received three shots from the dark-
ness of the forest; we charged the pre-
firing three valleys white on the rest
but could see nothing as might had 

fallen.</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144056"
<p>fallen, so returned to the steamer. On
the way back found eight bodies
of women and children, all headless
and some with their legs and
arms gone. Mr. de Bock found in
the Banana plantation two children
and an old woman, who, after
some hours, were persuaded to let
us what had occurred.</p>   
    
<p>It seems the village had been
attacked by a party of Arab slave
hunters about 3 o'clock that
afternoon. They had captured 
over a hundred of the in habi-
tants, and were engaged in des-
troying the Joen when the steamer
came in sight. They retreated im
mediately, and the shots I received
were probably fired by the rear
guard.</p>
    
<p>The next morning we followed their
rail some 3 or 4 miles back found
the bodies of 20 persons men, women
+ children, who were too young, old or 
inform to march rapidly, so

had</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144103"
<p>had been murdered in order to allow 
the caraven to retreat as fast as 
possible.</p>   
   
<p>As we had orders to proceed
with all despatch and join Com-
mandant Chaltin at Bena. Kamba
M. de Bocko did not consider him-
self justified in pursuing farther
the enemy.</p>   
    
<p>Such seems as this village pre-
sented were afterwards of not unfre-
quent occurence.</p>
    
<p>April 10th another body was
passed, but no xause for teach
could be discovered.</p>
    
<p>The Steamer arrived at Bema-
Kamba the next day, and instead of 
finding a great number of Arabs,
who were supposed to be fortfied
here, nothing was to be seen but 
the ruins of the Past established by
the State some years ago. This place
was occupied lasy years ago. This place
was occupied last year as the 
Headquarters of the Company known
as the "Kalanga Lyndicate, of which

Mr</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144110"
<p>Mr. Hodistin was the chief, and
was destroyed by the Arabs at the 
same time they murdered him and
his Expedition while on the way to
Riba-Riba.</p>
    
<p>Here we found letters directing the
steamers to come to Lhome, 20 miles
farther up. We left immediately and
after a day and a half arrived
the S.S. Villa d'anvers" was here, +
the Captain gave us Commandant
Chaltins orders to march without 
delay to Tchain + join him.</p>  
    
<p>We left the next morning, + that
afternoon encountered the Commandant
returning. He had been most-success-
ful defeating the Arabs m an open
fight, and completely destroying
the town of Jchari, which consisted
of 1200 houses and 15000 people
two days later both steamers after
for Bena Kamba, where the Expedition
was to be re-organized for its
March to Riba-Riba, through a 
section of country said to be defeuded

by</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_144123"
<ab>by a coting body of arabs.</ab>
    
<p>Small pay had appeared amongst
the soldiers and porters one white
officer, Mr. Coppee also had it. The 
Surgeon Dr. Dupont had a bad
case of dysentery, so, as the "Villa
d' Anvers" was leaving for Basko
in a few days it was decided to 
send these two offices back.</p>
    
<p>March 21st we left Bena Kamba

this ammunition 40 boxes, each containing 160
cartridges were distributed, this brought 
our ammunintion supply up to 34,600
