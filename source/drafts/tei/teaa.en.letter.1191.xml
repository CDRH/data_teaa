<p>ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS.</p>

<p>1. Report - "Ex-Minister Smith's

<pb n="Roll6-2011.jpg"/>

<p>No. 13. Consulate-General, U. S. A.,
Monrovia, Liberia, August 15, 1892.</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton,
Assistant Secretary of State,
WASHINGTON, D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor of submitting
the inclosed report on Ex-Minister
E. E. Smith's Mission to this country.</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>William D. McCoy,
Minister Resident
and Consul General</p>

<p>Inclosure</p>

<p>1. Report -- "Ex-Minister E. E. Smith's Mission."</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2012.jpg"/>

<p>Inclosure 1/3</p>

<p>Ex-Minister E. E> Smith's Mission.</p>

<p>The Bark "Liberia" arrived at
this port on the 6th day of April, 1892,
bringing fifty Emmigrants (14 families) who
came from the vicinity of Little Rock,
Arkansas (U. S. A.) Beverly Y. Payne
of this city was deputized by the American
Colonization Society to receive and
care for them until the arrival of
Ex-minister E. E. Smith who had been
appointed the Company's Agent, in place
of Mr. <unclear></unclear> King, removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith arrive (via England) on
the evening of April 13th.</p>

<p>The Emigrants peferred to settle on
the Mesurado River, near Johnsonville,
about 15 miles from Monrovia. Land
was given them in accordance with the
Liberian allotment - 10 acres to unmarried
persons over 18 years of age, 25 Acres
to heads of families or 20 Acres and one
town lot as they preferred.</p>

<p>The Society furnishes supplies for
six months and by that time it is expected
that each family will have raised
enough</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2013.jpg"/>

<p>enough Cassada, rice, and garden vegetables
to supply them with food.</p>

<p>Three families (14 persons) finding that
they would be obliged to wait three or
four years for this coffee tree to bear
before they could expect to handle <unclear></unclear>,
having to undergo an acclimation
process, and having no one to plan or
rather outline work for them as they do
in America, re-embarked for America <gap reason="missing"/>
next voyage that the Liberia made <gap reason="missing"/>
18th., 1892.</p>

<p>The other families are getting along
very well and express themselves as
being well satisfied. One has his
own house completed and has planted
over five thousand coffee scions. Another
has opened a business house and is doing
well.</p>

<p>Mr. SMith left on the Steamer
Sarache, on August 12th., leaving Mr.
Beverly Y. Payne as his Deputy.</p>

<p>Aomong the recommendations that
Mr. Smith will make to the Society
the following:-
1. That instead of 14 or 15 families (40
50 persons), from 80 to 100 families
(400</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2014.jpg"/>

<p>(400 to 500 persons) be sent out even if
they be not sent as often.
2. That the companies be made up
of mechanics and artisans as well as
farmers, instead of nearly all farmers as
in the past.
3. That they be sent in a steamer
instead of the cramped quarters of a 
300 ton Bark.
4. That the Liberian Government use
the appropriation made (see Acts of the
General Assembly, Inclosure of Dispatch No. 11,
Page 15) in preparing a receptacle or
reaptacles for the Emigrants and in having
a sufficiently large garden planted with
vegetables that shall be ready for use
by the time said Emigrants arrive.
5. That inasmuch as nearly all planting
and cultivating is done with the hoe
that Emigrants be encouraged to bring
improved machines and adopt modern
methods which will yield them much
larger returns, besides the repairing and
even making of which will furnish
employment to the mechanics and
artisans refered to in Sec. 2, above.
6. That Emigrants be supplined nine
months-</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2015.jpg"/>

<p>months instead of six as at present. <gap reason="missing"/>
will give them more time to acclimate <gap reason="missing"/>
get their houses and surroundings in <gap reason="missing"/>
a more comfortable condition.</p>

<p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>William D. McCoy
Minister-Resident and
Consul-General</p>
