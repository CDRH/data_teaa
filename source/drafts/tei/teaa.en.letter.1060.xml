<note>Secretary of State,<lb/>
Mar 17 1888</note>

<p>No 2</p>

<p>Hon T. F. Bayard<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor
most respectfully to again write you
in reference to the matter contained in
my last letter to, a part, of which you,
so kindly, replied. You state that I have
received all compensation due me to
Jan 12th 1888. Of course the statement is
true. It is also true that I am no longer
connected with the "Service" in the quality
and rank of U.S. Minister &amp;c near the
Government of Liberia. I am, however, custodian
and keeper of your (U.S.) Archives
in Monrovia, according to the decision
of Dr. Sinclair, Chief of the Consular
bureau. I am given by him to understand
that Capt. Beverly Y. Payne the acting V.C. 
General for the U.S. will not be recognized
by the U.S. Government, but that
I will be held responsible for his acts,
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1242.jpg"/>

As I am, by contract (copy of which you
have) for his salary. Now it certainly
will be working a hardship on me, to be
forced to pay Mr Payne, for his services to
the U.S. Government, and in no way be
remunerated or recompensated. It would
also be wrong in my opinion for the U.S.
Government to hold me on "my Bond" responsible
for his acts, when I am in no way
<sic>benefitted</sic>. I trust this will be considered
in the spirit which it is written. I do not
desire to have anything more than what
is justly due me. What is Mr. Payne's
status or relation with the U.S. government?
Will the U.S> government assume
and carry out the agreement made by me
with Mr Payne? Am I considered responsible
for his acts on "my bond," until my successor
takes charge of the Legation? I shall be
thankful to receive full and complete
answer to each of the three (3) within
interrogatories. I take this opportunity to
again express my high regard for your
consideration and to assure you that
I am your obedient servant.</p>

<p>Chas H. J. Taylor</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1243.jpg"/>

<p>Please forward reply at your
earliest convenience to no 814 N 3rd St.,
Richmond, VA</p>

<p>Sr Clair
Write to Mr Taylor
ack? Receipt, &amp; answer
his questions thus:-
1. Mr. Payne is acting Vice Consul Genl
and will be compensated
by the Govt. from Jan 11th 1888.
2. Mr Taylor's agreement
with Mr. Payne comes
to an end on Jan 11th 1888.
up to that time Mr.
Taylor must pay him.</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1244.jpg"/>

<p>The govt will pay Mr.
Payne after that time.
3. Mr Taylor is
not considered responsible
for any act, committed
by Mr. Payne after
Jan 11th.</p>

<p>The other portions
of your letter seem to
require no reply or
comment from me
20 Mar 1888</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1245.jpg"/>

<p>Consular Bureau
March 17/88</p>

<p>For the Secretary:

all services as Minister
Resident ad Consul
General to Liberia.

Mr. Payne whom he
left in charge of
the Consulate Gen'l
he must pay Payne
at the rate of $300.
per year upon that</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1246.jpg"/>

<p>date and not beyond.
Mr. Taylor is not
held responsible
for Mr. Payne's acts
nor for his compensation
