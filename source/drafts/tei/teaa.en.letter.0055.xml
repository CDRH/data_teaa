<p>Sir,<lb/>
I had the honor on the 15th 
of August last to acknowledge the 
reception of your despatch No 1 informing
me that the President 
had appointed me Commercial Agent
of the United States at this 
city. In the same despatch I 
replied to several questions requiring
answers.</p>

<p>On the 7th ultimo I received 
a communication dated July 6th 1864 
fom the Hon James E Harvey the 
United States Minister resident at
Lisbon, enclosing <unclear></unclear> my Certificate
of Appointment with authority of the 
Portuguese Majesty's government to act
in that capacity.</p>

<p>In consequence of a 
temporary interruption of steam 
communication between the Province 
and Portugal the Governor
<catchwords>General</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0055.002"/>

General has not for the past five 
months received any any official communication 
from his government consequently a separate official notice 
of my appointment has not arrived 
yet without which he cannot formally 
recognize me.- A mail 
steamer is momentarily expected here.</p>

<p>I have this day presented 
to John G. Willis Esq the 
Acting Commercial Agent, the 
official order of the Department 
dated May 14th 1864 for for him to 
deliver to me the Records and, 
Archives of the Commercial Agency 
together with the Seal Press Flag
arms statutes at large and other 
property of the United States which 
order was promptly complied with 
and I herewith enclose a certificate 
copy of the Inventory.  Wheaton's
Digest has never been received at 
this commercial Agency.</p>

<p>I mentioned to you 
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0055.003"/>

in my despatch No 1 my intentions
to visit Europe in 
a few weeks, <unclear>in consequence</unclear> of a 
previous mercantile engagement,
entered into previous to my
having any knowledge of my 
appointment as Commercial 
Agent. I regret to say the
importance of this engagement 
forces me to carry it out and 
I hope the Department will 
wish this involuntary departure 
from my port of duty an exception 
to Circular of Department
of State no 46 on file at this 
office.</p>

<p>I shall leave for England
early in December next 
my absence will only be of four
months duration during which 
time the office will be represented
as Acting Commercial Agent 
by my brother Frederic A 
Silva a native citizen of the 
<catchwords>United States</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0055.004"/>

United States well qualified for 
the duties that will devolve upon
him. I notice that the 
Agency requires an additional 
supply of blanks No 44, 14, <hi rend="underline">8</hi> 142
143, 144, 130 some of which are entirely
out.</p>

<p>I notice also there has 
been great difficulty in forwarding 
packages from the Department 
to this Agency. The best way 
would be to address to the care 
of Messer Robert <unclear>F Cannon &amp; Co 75</unclear>
<unclear>St</unclear><unclear>Vincent Street</unclear> Glasgow
Scotland and they will forward
it to me by one of their 
vessels.</p>

<p>My Passport as Commerce 
Agent has not been received 
yet.</p>
