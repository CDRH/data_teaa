<p>
<unclear>Mister,</unclear>

I have the honor of accusing the reception of the
note from Mr <unclear/> dated from <unclear/> de ce <unclear/> This
note was accompanied by a document that <unclear>showed</unclear> that
the american properties are <unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear>autrefois de</unclear>
<unclear/> on a foot that <unclear>should accuse</unclear>, in <unclear/> the
principle of reciprocity, to <unclear/> french,
coming from this colony the privileges accorded by
the act of <unclear>Congress</unclear>, on May 9th <unclear>1838</unclear>, to the french <unclear>exercises</unclear> 
coming from Martinique and Guadeloupe. Mr
<unclear/>Fontain demanded, in consequence,<unclear>the adaption of the</unclear>
necessary measures to establish, in the american
ports, the equality of treatment in favor of the
french properties, coming from this colony, and to
restitute to <unclear>brick Charles</unclear> the <unclear>rights</unclear> <unclear/>
removed from this vessel by the <unclear>collection of the</unclear> <unclear/>
of <unclear/>.
</p>

<p>
The Present to whom I communicated the letter from
Mr. <unclear>Fontain</unclear> is disposed now, <unclear>as it was</unclear>
</p>

Mister <unclear>Alphonse Sageat,</unclear> charged with affair of France.

<pb n="20160614_144108.jpg"/>

<p>
at the time of our first correspondance on this
subject, to apply, in the biggest extension,
the principle of reciprocity that forms one of the bases
of the commercial politics of the United States; but,
as the application of this principle, beyond the limits
prescribed by the Convention of 1822 and the act of
Congress to which Mr. Fontain is referring to, is not found
to be comprised in the attributions that are conferred upon it
the existing legislation, he charged me with telling you
that he hastens to profit from the first occasion,
after the reunion of Congress, to present to this
assemblee the note from Mr. Fontain, and to demand of it
to put in measure by the adoption of all legislative
disposition that will be necessary in this effect, to satisfy
the desire of your government.
</p>

<p>
In that which concerns the reimbursement of the differential
rights removed from the brik Charles, as it
resulted in the decision of the Treasury, that, already, was
communicated to your legation, that this tax was
perceived in virtue of the law, the President did not think
to be authorised to demand of Congress the necessary funds <!-- 'nécesessaires' is hyphenated and split between 'néces-' and '-saires'. -->
for operating this reimbursement.
</p>

<p>
In another part of his letter, Mr. Fontain
</p>

<note>
<supplied>Lequel</supplied>
</note>

<pb n="20160614_144115.jpg"/>

<p>
calls for, in the name of his government and in virtue of the principle
of reciprocity, the enjoyment his favor of the french properties,
coming from Senegal, the assured advantages by the act of 1828,
to those coming from Martinique and Guadeloupe, and founds
his reclamation on the fact that the american properties
that enter in the Port of Gorée are assimilated by the
payment of one franc by the barrel by the french properties,
coming from foreign contries; and he announces to me <unclear/> <unclear/> to obtain
this advantage, your government would be disposed to abolish the 
differential rights removed from the <unclear/> <unclear>imported</unclear>
by american properties, and left in <unclear/> of Goree.
</p>

<p>
On this proposition, several objections presented themselves,
even after the revocation of the rights above. First,
the admission of american vessels would be limited to the port
of Gorée, while the french properties coming from this
<unclear>Port,</unclear> or from all other points of the Colony would be indistinctly <!-- 'indistinctement' is hyphenated and split between 'indis-' and '-tinctement'. -->
admitted to the United States. Then, in examining
the printed resume that accompanies the letter of Mr.
Fontain, it seems,by the numbers 8 and 9 of the general "dispositions <!-- American quotation marks (" ") are used in place of French angle quotation marks -->
that the importation of certain products from the
United States, and the exportation of certain others, by
american properties, are <unclear/>, and, by the table
of taxes, that the merchandises imported under the
</p>

<unclear/>

<pb n="20160614_144126.jpg"/>

<p>
american flag are <unclear>sujettes</unclear> to the rights, quadrupled 
by those removed from the same merchandises imported
by french properties. If this interpretation of the
tariff is exact, I do not see how Mr. Fontain
can invoke the principle of reciprocity to press
the demand of your government. The President does
not feel authorised consequently, to submit it to the
consideration of Congress. But he gave me the order
to assure you that when your government judges it to be
appropriate to put the commerce between the United States
and the Ports of Senegal on a foot of perfect
reciprocity, it will be a pleasure to recommend to
Congress the adoption of corresponding measures, on
the part of the United States.
</p>

<p>
I seize this occasion.
Signed John Forsyth
