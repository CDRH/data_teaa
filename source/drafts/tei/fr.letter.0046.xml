Legation of the United States
Paris May 22nd 1878.
</ab>

<p>
On the 15th November 1876
M. Washburne notified the Duke
Decazes that the Commercial Agency
of the United States at Gaboon, Africa
had been abolished, Congress having <!-- 'having' is hyphenated and split across two lines between 'hav-' and 'ing' -->
made no appropriation for
the salary of the Agent. Subsquently
the Agency was reestablished,
the former incumbent, M Albert
Bushnell, having asked to be
appointed without salary. Jobe
advises me that March 4th 1877,
he received a depatch so
informing him, and that his
Commission would be duy
forwarded; that he communicated <!-- 'communicated' is hyphenated and splot between 'commu-' and 'cated'  -->
</p>

<pb facs="20160614_112304.jpg"/>

<p>
this despatch at the
French Commandant at Gabon
and with his permission resumed
the duties of Commercial Agent;
that sometime afterward, he
received his Commission, directly
from the Department of State.
With a despatch stating that as, as
he had already been recognized
and had an exequatur from
the French Government, it was
deemed unnecessary to ask for
another. By a communication
now received from the
Commercial Agency at Gaboon.
I learn that the Admiral
Commandant has notified the
Vice-Commercial Agent. M.
Murphy that the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs at Paris having
received no notice from the
Legation of the United States
</p>

<pb facs="20160614_112314.jpg"/>

<p>
of the re-establisment of that
Agency, the French Authorities
would until further orders,
consider the suppression of
the Agency as definitive.
</p>

<p>
The Official Register of the
Department of State, issued
December 1877, gives the appointment of Albert Bushnell
as Commercial Agent at
Gaboon, Jan. 12, 1877. Confirming
the statement of M. Bushnell
himself above given.
</p>

<p>
In view of these facts, I have
the honor to ask your Excellency
if no inconsistent with the
rules of your Department,
to waive the presentation of
the Commission of M.
Bushnell, and cause the
necessary exequatur to be
issued for his recognition in his
</p>

<pb facs="20160614_112321.jpg"/>

<p>
official capacity as Commercia
Agent of the United States at
Gaboon.
</p>

<p>
I avail myself of this occasion
to renew to you Excellency the
assurances of the distinguished
consideration with which I have the
honor to be.
