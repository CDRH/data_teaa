<p>The Saturday of Des Moines
prints a portrait and biography of A.
Clark and calls him "the Fred. Douglass
of the West." At the African M.
E. COnference in Galesburg, Ill., last
week, Mr. Clark, who was a delegate,
was formally introduced for remarks
by Dr. Derrick, of New York, the
missionary secretary, and made a
speech which the published report says
showed that "he has the faculty of saying
a great deal in a very interesting
way." The conference adopted the
following resultion:
Resolved. That this meeting heartily
endorse the appointment of Hon. Alexander
Clark, our distinguished fellow-citizen, as
Minister Resident and Consul-General to the
Republic of Liberia, which is another evidence
of President Harrison's intention to recognize
the citizenship of the American people, regardless
of race, color or previous condition.</p>

<p>Festival.
The ladies of St. Mary's congregation
will give a festival at Union Hall
on Wednesday and Thursday evenings,

<p>Muscatine's Diplomats.
A. Clark and S. McNutt have received
formal notice and returned the
necessary bonds. The bond in the case
of Mr Clark is $6,000 and of Mr McNutt
$5,000. The former has 70 days
in which to prepare himself and make
the joourney to Monrovia and the latter
fifty-five days to reach Maracaibo.
This to date from approval of the bon.
The regulations provide that the sufficiency
of the bond must be endorsed
by the U.S. Attorney for the district,
one of the U.S. Senators from Iowa or
the Congressman from this district.
In this case each of the appointees
forwarded his bond to Congressman
Hayes for endorsement.</p>

<p>While Mr. McNutt's bond is a strong
one and ample in every respect, Mr.
Clark's is probably the strongest ever
given by any one in Muscatine county,
as its four signers represent
considerably more than a million dollars.</p>
