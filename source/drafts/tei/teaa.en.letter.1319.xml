<p>No. 80. Consular.
Consulate General
of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
October 10, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir
In transmitting my
final report of the death and
settlement of the estate of the
late William Parker, deceased,
who died at Robertsport,
Grand Cape Mount Territory
Liberia, November 14,
1900. I have the honor to
say that I can only transmit
such a report as has
been forwarded to me by
Jas. H. Lewis, the local
Administrator of the effects of the
deceased.</p>

<p>From correspondence between
him</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4104.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>him and myself (copies of
which have long since been
transmitted to the Department)
you will observe that I used
every possible effort to
prevent Mr. Lewis from disposing
of the effects of the deceased.</p>

<p>As I have previously reported
to the Department, the local
authorities, at Robertsport,
set up the claim that the
deceased, William Parker,
was a Liberian citizen, and
as such, they had a right to
administer upon his effects
as a Liberian citizen, turning
over the proceeds of
his effects to me less their
charge, commissions and
expenses.</p>

<p>After Mr. Lewis had
forwarded to me a very
indefinite report and statement
of the estate, which reached
me</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4105.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>me early in April 1901, you
will see b reference to a copy
of my despatch No. 13, Miscellaneous,
of April 16, 1901, to the
State Department, Monrovia,
that I setforth many irregularities
in the report of the Administrator,
and asked the
assistance of the Liberian
Government in having
them rectified.</p>

<p>To this despatch No. 13, above
refined to the Liberian Government
has never directly
replied, but did write Mr.
Lewis to report to me,
hence, I have since received
receipts to the amount of the
disbursements; but as these
receipts were, with but few
exceptions, all written and
signed in the hand writing
of the Administrator himself;
several signed by mark,
without any witness,
thereto</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4106.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>thereto, they appeared to me to
be rather suspicious, hence I
called upon, and showed
the receipts to the President,
(who is de facto Secretary
of State) who returned the
suspicious receipts to the local
Superintendent, at Robertsport,
to have them verified,
consolidated into one, signed
by one of the recipiants and
returned to me through the
Department of State, Monrovia.</p>

<p>After transmitting copies of
correspondence between Mr.
Lewis, the Department of
State, Monrovia, and
myself relative to this
matter; and informing
the Department of State,
Washington, relative to
the conflicting claims of the
local authorities and
myself, as to the nationality
of</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4107.jpg"/>

<p>7</p>

<p>of the deceased; and having
received from the Department
of State, Washington
in Diplomatic Despatch No
66, May 1, 1901, a request
that I procure and transmit
to said Department
a copy of the Liberian Statutes,
relating to the naturalization,
in Liberia of citizen of the
United States of African
descent, I have since
transmitting copies of said
statutes, awaited instructions
from Washington, as to whether,
in the opinion of the
Department, under existing
Liberian statutes, the
deceased, William Parker,
was a Liberian or an
American citizen. Further,
whether I should press
my request, by demands,
made in my No. 13, of
April 16, 1901, of the Liberian
Government,</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4108.jpg"/>

<p>8</p>

<p>Government, relative to Jas.
H. Lewis or relinquish them,
by failing to press them.
You will doubtless observe,
in my fourth statement
and request, in said No. 14,
of April 16, 1901, that I have
no possible means. beyond
circumstantial evidence, (the
most plausible of which
would hardly convict a
Liberian in a Liberian
Court, contended against
by a foreign Government)
of proving that Jas. H. Lewis,
did really come into possession
of the £30 Sterling and
the two American $10, gold
pieces; received from me the
morning of the day he sailed
from Monrovia for Robertsport
Liberia.</p>

<p>While I have been waiting
for the above desired instructions,
I have been somewhat
at</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4109.jpg"/>

<p>9</p>

<p>at a loss, whether to report
the deceased, William Parker,
as a deceased American citizen
or not. Hence my delay in
officially reporting his
demise and the final settlement
of his estate, as it has
been transmitted to me, by
the local Administrator.
I have further to advise
you that the deceased,
William Parker, carried
a Life Policy, the which
he had left in America, I
think, with his wife. Since
his death Wm. R. Morris
Esq. <unclear></unclear> Building,
Minneappolis, Minnesota,
consel for Mrs. Parker
has forwarded a blank,
disering certain evidence
of the death &amp;c. of William
Parker, necessary in prosecuting
her claim for said
Life Policy. This evidence
was</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4110.jpg"/>

<p>10</p>

<p>was certified to by three local
officials at Robertsport; the
official character of which
had to be certified to by me.
Hence the intem in said
account, in aluding the
Clerk's official character,
in the Inventory, for certifying
to the official character
of four officials.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith,
Consul General.</p>
