<p>Mr. Kasson told me that he was planning
to take the floor at Congress to expose the situation of
the State of the Congo. I supplied to him on this subject all the
information that I possess (Official bulletins- Report
of Mr Allard in the consular collection <unclear></unclear>), but
if you had some particular information to communicate
to him, that could be useful to the cause in
favor of that which he will speak.- The congress of African
ethnology <unclear></unclear> without doubt toward the middle of the summer
just as twenty-some others Congress. They have no
patriotic goal or determined and are only called to
enforce the exposition of an intellectual and moral aureole."</p>

<p>"I have the honor to transmit to you the
demand- (the original of this demand is found annexed
at the speach the 14th of next August in Chicago in order
to inaugurate the african Congress by a discourse of the
Representative of the Sovereign who contributed the most to
bring the civilization to Africaand to present the
Belgians who will come one can suppose at least to expose
the glorious work of the King.</p>

<p>"I accused reception of this <unclear> invitation</unclear>
in thanking and in saying that in my quality as Minister 
of Belgium exclusively, I could not respond to
their gracious <unclear>invitaion</unclear> until having taken the orders of the
Government of the King. </p>

<pb></pb>

<p>"It would seem useful that in a <unclear></unclear>
on Africa someone competent changed the
speaking especially of the creation and development of
the Independent State.</p>
    
<p>"Though this Congress is as I
told you, that an academic reunion under the determined 
goal, it is however to examine if it would be
of our advantage to search to take practical 
advantage in giving it relief and in profiting
to popularize the work of the Congo in a country <unclear>where</unclear>
the support could be useful to us."</p>
    
<p>Our Minister in Washington has for
instructions to face the offical imitation that it <unclear></unclear>
assist it in the ceremonies of the opening of the Exposition that
had place in the first days of the month of the King. The sejour
that he will make in Chicago at this occasion will be of short duration; <unclear></unclear>
will rejoin his post as soon as the ceremonies of which it is question are
terminated His instructions, according to the communication that you had
with me the 18th of August, could not predict the hypothesis of a voyage to
Chicago in the month of next August.</p>
    
<p>I pray you, Mister Count, to
to share with me the observations that the information
preceding you would have suggested and to accept the assurances
of my highest consideration</p>
    
<p>Merode <unclear>Westerloo</unclear></p>
