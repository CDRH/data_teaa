Sir,
I am directed to cknowledge the receipt of your letter of September 12th 1854, addressed to the Commander in Chief of the African Squadron.

The Western Coast of Africa is of great extent and there are t present, in this Squadron but three vessels of evaw, it is therefore impossible to comply with your request that one of them should visit Sierra Leone at least once or twce in every two months. 

The Commodore has written to the Government renewing his statement of the necesity for an American Consulate at Sierra Leone, and has recalled the attention of the Secretary of the Navy to a former despatch in which he reported of the ppointment he had conferred upon you, and urged its confirmation.

By order of Comm. Mayo

I have the honor to be
Very Respectfully
Your Obdt Servt

Flag Liutenant
African Squadron

John E. Taylor 
Acting Consul of the
United States at 
Sierra Leone
