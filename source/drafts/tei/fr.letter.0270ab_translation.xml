<p> Legation of Belgium
in Washington
No 830/369
Congo and the protestant
missions</p>
    
<p>Confidential</p>

<p> November 22nd 1910</p>
    
<p>Mister Minister</p>

<p> I received last spring
the visit from Mr. Joseph Clark, baptist
missionary, who has lived in the Congo for around
twenty years, and who is particularly
distinguished in the violent
country lead by the protestant
missions of the United States against the old Independent
State of the Congo. He was accompanied
by another member of the mission
Mr. Richards. We had a long
conversation, and I spared them an
interview in Brussels with Mr. Minister
of the Colonies at the moment of their depart from the Congo.</p>
    
<p>These gentlemen returned to see me
today, sent from Boston, for the
"American Baptist Foreign Mission
Society Commission to the Congo Mission
and the Sudan.", to thank me for the
welcome that I made to them a few months
ago, they told me what followed.</p>
    
<p>We have just made a long
voyage in the interior of the Belgian Congo,
We were at 100 milles beyond </p>

<p>His Excellence
Mister Davignon,
in Brussels</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p> Coquilhoutville and penetrated the heart
of the regions of exploitation of the rubber.</p>
    
<p> We care to tell you that there where we
were other times <unclear></unclear> with reclamations
<unclear>false</unclear> a single indigenous during our whole
voyage did not address themself to us to
complaoin of whatever <unclear></unclear> this is.</p>
    
 <p>We will send to you under little a
 letter on the part of the "American Foreign
 Mission Society" with which you can make
 such use that pleases you.</p>

<p> I would like to add Mr. Joseph Clarke
to express the particular esteem that we
inspired a belgian officer commanding
the district of Coquilhatrille who was named
Duborcq I believe. He has a brother who is also
an officer: this information could aid
the indiginous the person of which is question
gives the case of error in the orthography of
his name.</p>

<p>I have the honor
l signed Couras de Buisseret</p>
