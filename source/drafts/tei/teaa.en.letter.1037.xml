<p><add>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
MAY 7 1887
RECEIVED</add></p>

<p>No. 64.</p>

<p>U.S. Consulate General
Monrovia April 4th/87.</p>

<p>Mr S. S. Sevier,</p>

<p>To Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Subject</p>

<p>Trouble at Cavolla</p>

<p>Synopsis</p>

<p>Disloyalty and rebellion.</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1145.jpg"/>

<p>"Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance, and knwoeldge, and in
all diligence, and in your love see that you abound in this grace also."</p>

<p>"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich yet fo our
sakes he became poor that through his poverty ye might be rich."</p>

<p>"If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not
according to that he hath not." II Cor. VIII.</p>

<p>"He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which soweth bountifully
shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him
give; not grudgingly, or of necessity for God LOVETH A CHEERFUN GIVER." II Cor. IX.</p>

<p>TO THE MONROVIA PUBLIC:</p>

<p>There is trouble at Cavalla; spirit of disloyalty and
rebellion is at work. Because the civilized and christian
natives did not sympathize, with this feeling, they were
forced to leave their homes and relations to save their
lives, and flee to Harper, Cape Palmas. Leaving their
farms and employments they are deprived of the means of
support, and are dependent upon christian help until they
can help themselves.</p>

<p>The people at Cape Palmas, have done, and are doing all
in their power for the comfort of the refugees. This appeal
comes to you now. What will you do? Out of your
abundance will you give much, and out of your poverty give
a little? Every little will be a help. Let not the benevolent
hard working poor fail to give because they have
but a little: but of that little give something.</p>

<p>Every thing is needed, food, raiment, household articles
&amp;c : the sufferers number between forty and fifty men,
women and children. Show your liberality towards your
brethren and sisters of this native church, the church of
the Epiphany at Cavalla. Right Rev. Bishop Ferguson
will gladly bear to them your christian gifts.</p>

<p>City of Monrovia,
March 21st 1887.
C. T. O. King,
Mayor</p>
