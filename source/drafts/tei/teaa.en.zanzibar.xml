<p>Introduction</p>

<p>On the 5 rolls of this microfilm publication are reproduced
11 volumes that contain mainly despatches, with enclosures, ad-
dressed to the Department of State by U.S. consular officials
at Zanzibar, Zanzibar, British Africa, between April 27, 1836,
and June 7, 1906.</p>

<p>The despatches, with few exceptions, are arranged in chron-
ological order. At the beginning of Roll 1 are reproduced se-
lected pages from 23 State Department registers of correspondence
that constitute a register of despatches from Zanzibar between
April 27, 1836, and June 7, 1906.</p>

<p>Interspersed throughout the series are such documents as
occasional memoranda prepared by other State Department offi-
cials and letters from private citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>The consular post at Zanzibar was established on March 11,
1836, and the appointment of Richard P. Waters as the first con-
sul was confirmed on the same day. During the period 1836-1906
several special agents from the Department of State were sent to
the consulate: Robert W. Shuffeldt, 1878; Frederic M. Cheney,
1886; and Augustus C. B. Govea, 1888. The post was closed tempo-
rarily between November 1894 and August 1895.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects to which the despatches relate are
shipwrecks, desertions, and mutinies and other disturbances on
U.S. vessels; the repression of the slave trade and the aboli-
tion of slavery, 1846-97; concessions granted on the East Afri-
can Coast to foreign governments; the establishment of the
British Protectorate, 1890; and the African expiditions of
John H. Speke and James A. Grant, 1862-63; Baron Karl K. von der
Decken, 1865; David Livingstone, 1866-73; and Henry M. Stanley,
1871-72 and 1874-89. Included also are photographs of Zanzibar
taken during a skirmish between the Sultan's forces and the
British forces, 1896, and issues of the Gazette for Zanzibar and
East Africa and the Bombay Government Gazette.</p>

<p>Many despatches are transmittal letters for enclosures of
a routine nature forwarded by consular officials to the Depart-
ment of State, such as reports on consular fees received and on
trade. In accordance with departmental policy adopted in 1870,
however, most statistical enclosures were removed from their
covering letters and distributed among other records of the De-
partment of State or sent to other departments of the Government.</p>

<p>The records reproduced in this microcopy are part of the
records in the National Archives designated as Record Group 59,
General Records of the Department of State.</p>

<pb facs="130913.jpg"/>

<p>National Archives Microfilm Publications</p>

<p>In the same record group are several series of volumes con-
taining additional documents on relations between posts in the
western aread of the Indian Ocean and the United States. There
are microcopies available on despatches from U.S. consular offi-
cials at Aden, Aden, 1880-1906 (T-503); Bombay, India, 1838-1906
(Microcopy 168); Lourenco Marques, Mozambique, Prtuguese Africa,
1854-1906 (T-171); Mahe, Seychelles Islands, Indian Ocean,
1868-88 (T-437); Muscat (Masqat), Oman, 1880-1906 (T-638), for 
1836-57 see Zanzibar (Rolls 1-3 of Microcopy 468); Port Louis,
Mauritius, Mascarene Islands, Indian Ocean, 1794-1805, 1817-1906
(Microcopy 462); St. Denis, Réunion Island, Mascarene Islands,
Indian Ocean, 1880-92 (Microcopy 463); and Tamatave, Madagascar,
1853-1906 (T-60). Complementary to the despatches are instruc-
tions to the consuls. Other related records are notes from the 
foreign mission of Zanzibar in the United States to the Depart-
ment of State, 1843-1905 (Roll 3 of T-953).</p>

<p>The method of arranging the consular and diplomatic series
cited above was discontinued in 1906 when the Department of
State adopted the practice of filing incoming and outgoing cor-
respondence, memoranda, and other documents by subject.</p>

<p>In the Department of State decimal file, 1910-29, also in
Record Group 59, are additional documents relating to Zanzibar.
Some documents are in the series relating to internal affairs of
British Africa (Roll 33 of Microcopy 583), and other documents
are in the series concerning political relations between British
Africa and other states (Microcopies 584 and 585).</p>

<p>In Record Group 84, Records of the Foreign Service Posts
of the Department of State, in the National Archives, are rec-
ords originally kept at U.S. diplomatic and consular posts.
Among them are records of the post at Zanzibar, 1834-1918, and
at other posts in the western area of the Indian Ocean. One vol-
ume of documents from Zanzibar is included in records of the 
post at Mombasa, Kenya, British Africa, 1901-26.</p>

<p>The records reproduced in this microcopy were prepared for
filming by Ralph E. Huss, who also wrote these introductory re-
marks and provided the other editorial material.</p>

To the <unclear/>

Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir.
I have the honor to acknowledge
dispatch no 43, dated May 6th
1886 from the Department of State
incosing a draft of a new treaty
and a "Full Power" from the Pres-
ident for me to conclude the
same.</p>

<p>I at <unclear/> placed myself in
communication with His High-
ness the Sultan of Zanzibar and
sent him a draft of the proposed
treaty.</p>

<p>His Higness expressed himself
as very <unclear/> gratified that the
United States Government was
willing to make a new treaty
to his advantage. The treaty was
immediately drawn up in the <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="131322.jpg"/>

<p>English and <unclear/> languages, and
on the third July it was signed
by myself and H. H. <unclear/> Sec-
retary, who was H. H. Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>The treaty was made in du-
plicatel one copy is inclosed
with this dispatch and the other
is in His Higness possession.</p>

<p>I have <unclear/> over <unclear/> the
English <unclear/> treaties and I
cannot see that thus in any ad-
vantages that they get that is not
<unclear/> us.</p>

<p>His Highness the Sultan did
not <unclear/> one question, but ordered
the treaty got ready.</p>

<p>I am greatly indebted to one
Kanji Ragpah, a native <unclear/>
new who is an intimate friend
of the Sultan, in getting the treaty
through so quickly.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to request the
Department of State to inform me
if any allowance will be made <unclear/>
for making the new treaty with the
Sultan of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>I consider that such work is
outside of the line of a Consul's duty
and it made a great deal of extra
work and trouble, as is always the
case in these Oriental countries.</p>

<p>The Treaty was to be got through
in a great hurry and it was only
from my being a very old friend of
the Sultan that it was finished
in so short a time.</p>

<p>The salary of this Consulate
is only $1000. for <unclear/> and I
consider that $500 would be a fiar
recompense for my outside work on this
new treaty.</p>

United States Consulate
Zanzibar Sept 8 1886
To the Hon
Third Assist. Secy of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to enclose
herewith a letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the
Department of State, a copy of 
which he has sent to this Consulate
and which I have translated
and also enclose herewith.</p>

<p>The sum and substance of
this communication is, a request
of our Government to sanction
a tax on his own subjects, which
I have assured His Highness will
be undoubtedly granted time.</p>

<p>The Germans and English as
a pretence for making trouble with
the Sultan, claim that he has no
right to levy any taxes or duties
or any produce rained in the Sultanate</p>

<pb facs="131837.jpg"/>

<p>Sultanate of Zanzibar other
tahn is specified in the new
treaties, or on his own subjects.
The Sultan claims that he has
a right to tax his own subjects
as he pleases and produce belong-
ing to them.</p>

<p>This is a matter which
does not in the <unclear/> concern
Americans or American interests
in any way and which I
assume that our Government
will not care for me to take any
part in troubles likely to arise
from this dispute.</p>

Verbatim.</p>

<p>In the name of God the <unclear/></p>

<p>To His Excellency the noble, the liberal
and learned minister of Foreign Affairs of
the United States of America, may God prolong
his life in unblemished glory!</p>

<p>We had the honor to inform you in a
telegram of the 6th of August that we directed
a letter to your Excellency, this is the letter.</p>

<p>We have the pleasure to inform your
Exellency, that the new treaties with England
and Germany and the new clauses of duplicate
concluded with your country entered in force
on the 19th of August 1886 corresponding to the
<unclear/> New Year and that the Custom
Hour is in our own hands.</p>

<p>I have to inform you that in the new
treaties are not mentioned fifty five articles
of produce of our grant and on which we al-
ways had 5% duty- this produce has nothing
to do with the imports and exports by Europeans
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="131924.jpg"/>

<p>it concerns only my own people, who
do not pay any other taxes, so we continue
to tax the fifty-five articles of produce as before
at 5%.</p>

<p>We send you the names of the fifty-
five articles of the named produce in a list
joined to the letter and ask you to consider
it and sanction it. Salaam!</p>

<p>This letter was composed on the 7th
of September corresponding to the 6th of Jul-Hay
1303 of the Hejira.

To the Hon.
Third Assist. Secy of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir!
I have the honor to in-
form you that the 14th inst.
a fleet of six German Men-
of-war under Admiral Knorr
arrived at this port, followed
on the 15th by two French,
and one English is now
lying in the harbor.</p>

<p>The object of this movement
has not yet been made pub-
lic but it is understood that
the Sultan has been compelled
to cede a large portion of his
Coast territory to Germany and
one seaport to England.</p>

<p>This, of course is the end
of Arab power on this Coast power.</p>

<pb facs="132125.jpg"/>

<p>In my opinion American
interests and all foreign in-
terests but Germany, will suffer
greatly bu these changes and
it is greatly to be regretted
that some Government would
not assist the Sultan's Gov-
ernment against this German
robbery.</p>

<p>Considering that the Sultan's
power to control the various
wild and lawless tribes which are
under his <unclear>surcrainty</unclear>, will be
materially weakened and that
our large American interests
are absolutely without protec-
tion in case of riot or bom-
bardment, and that as the
first treaty power with the
Sultan we should be in some
way represented in the impor-
tant changes and transfers sure
to take place- I recommend
that an American man-of-war
of good sire be sent to remain</p>

<pb facs="132131.jpg"/>

<p>here at Zanzibar until this
trouble is definitely settled.</p>

<p>I trust that the Govern-
ment will take immediate
action in this matter as it
is one which admits of no
delay.</p>

<p>As representation of the
two largest houses in Zanzibar
I feel very anxious about the
large amount of property be-
longing to me being exposed
to fire or any incidiary acts.
also the future of the American
trade seems very uncertain and
I fear will be much injured
by the precedence which this
affair will give Germany-</p>

To the Hon.
Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir-
I had the honor to address
you on the 15th August 86 from
Zanzibar asking an allowance
of $500 for making a treaty with
the Sultan. On the 28th Sep 86 you
replied that there was no authority
of law to make an allowance.</p>

<p>I had hoped as the claim was just
something would be allowed and I went
to considerable expense to get the treaty
through quickly which I could not
afford out od $1000. per <unclear/> salary.</p>

<p>The climate of Zanzibar is a very
<unclear/> one for white men and my
health has been impaired by a <unclear>widower</unclear>
there. I take the liberty to ask of the
Hon. Secretary that some consideration

Zanzibar. January 30th, 1887
To the Hon.
Third Assist Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to in-
form you that the German
operations on this Coast have
so far resulted in the acqui-
sition of a strip of mangrove
swamp and marsh land some
forty miles long, situated on the
Coast about two hundred miles
North of Zanzibar, also a Ger-
man protectorate is acknowledged
for <unclear>Witu</unclear>, and the lease of two
Custom Houses on the Coast to 
the German East African Tra-
ding Company- the Sultan's
authority is restricted to a strip
of Coast Land ten miles wide 
extending from Jungs Bay to
<unclear>Kaperniz</unclear>, and ten miles around
each of</p>

<pb facs="132501.jpg"/>

<p>each of his Bin Addah tourns,
but the terms of this agreement
are I suppose more familiar
to the Department than to me.</p>

<p>At the time of writing my
Despatch No 108. in which I
suggest that a man-of-war
be sent here on account of this
German incident- feeling against
white-men in town was very
bitter and there was every pros-
pect of trouble, but at present the
negotiations are progressing fa-
vorably and quietly and there
is now no necessity for a man-
of-war to call here, although
it always has a good effect, and
I should very much like to
see one of our gun-bouts in
the harbor for a month or two
just at present.</p>

<p>The workings of the new
tariff on articles imported in
to the Island of Zanzibar
from the mainland are not
wholly</p>

<pb facs="132507.jpg"/>

<p>wholly satisfactory- this is
especially applicable to Ivory,
the market price of which it
is very difficult to fit, and the
Sultan's Collector of Customs
at present is a most unsuitable
man for the place and who
uses his position unfairly to 
further his own business; he
also, by buying small lots at
high prices keeps the price of
Ivory far above what it should
be- as my commercial position
in Canzibar is principally to
buy Ivory this affects me directly.</p>

<p>As soon as the German
affair is settled, the Sultan
will be forced to remove this
Collector and observe the spirit
as well as the letter of the treaties.
I am personally in sympathy
with the Germans and English
in this movement although
I am aware that our Govern-
ment does not wish to interfere
in any way</p>

<pb facs="132514.jpg"/>

<p>in any way with the internal
affairs of the Sultan's Government
but I think that a joint pro-
test of the German, English and
American consuls against this
man's continuing in office will
benefit all natinalities without
unpleasant complications.</p>

<p>I have to report the death
of the Interpreter of this Consulate
Joharris bin Saif, on the 29th inst.
after a service of nearly forty years:
his place will probably be filled
by an appointer of Consul Pratt's
after he takes ove the office-

<p>In this connection the
resignatin of Sir John Krik
NBM Political Agent and
Consul General is significant:
since it should appear to be
in the direct line of British
non-inerference with the proj-
ect of the German government
for the colonization of the
East Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>this market has for some time
been over supplied with <unclear/>
English and Indian goods.

American Imports

The imports from the United
States may be said to consist
<unclear/> of <unclear/> Petroleum,
unbleached cotton and soap-
these being the staples handled
by the American <unclear/> engaged
in this trade. The former
of these by its phenomenal cheap-
ness has completely taken the
place of the <unclear/> , which
in former <unclear/> were used
exclusively for illuminating
purposes.</p>

<pb facs="133057.jpg"/>

<p>all petroleum is often sold in
this market as low as one dol-
lar and a quarter- United States
currency- which fact would
not commend it to the <unclear/>
consideration of experts in 
America. The yearly consump-
tion of East Africa- Zanzibar
being the <unclear/> point-
is upwards of 75,000 cases.</p>

<p>American Consuls have for
many years been the stand
and in this market but their
use has been much curtailed
within the past the years by
the <unclear/> of the Cotton
manufactured in India.</p>

<unclear/> James D. Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washinton DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have to request of
the Department instanction
in relation to the Article in
the New English and German
treaties, stipulating that
goods may be landed here
in bond, for a period not
exceding six months.</p>

<p>This question is li-
able to arise at any time
and I should be glad to
know just what rights
might</p>

<pb facs="133404.jpg"/>

<p>might be claimed by Am-
ericans under this article.</p>

<p>The clause in the
new treaties relating to the
duty of <unclear/>-five per cent
in <unclear/> liquors, is prac-
tically a dead-letter. From
the fact that France has
not assinted to the appli-
cation of the Provised tariff
of Zanzibar to the experts
of France <unclear/> this
country.</p>

<p>Nationally, the English
and German merchants ob-
jected to paying any high-
er duty in <unclear/> liquprs
than was being paid by
the French i.c. five per cent
and</p>

<pb facs="133409.jpg"/>

<p>and the new rate (257-)
consequently could not be
sustained.</p>

<p>The Sultan, doubtless
having in mind he fact
that this new rate was in-
tended in past, as a com-
pensation for a reduction
of the duty in certain art-
icles of Export- is not
inclined to allow the for-
eign merchants any priv-
ilages under the new
treaties.</p>

<p>It is well known that
the Sultan does not <unclear/>
with favor in the idea of
landing goods in bond
and he might possibly
object</p>

<pb facs="133414.jpg"/>

<p>object on the grounds men-
tioned above.</p>

<p>It is often a great
convenience- as well as a
saving of expense- to Am-
ericans engaged in business
here to land goods in
bond: since in that way
a vessel might proceed
direct to her destination
without stopping at an
intermediate port.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to ad-
dress the Department at this
time in relation to the claim
of Dr. B. F. <unclear/> against
Sultan Abdullah. King od
Johanna.</p>

<p>This claim is of long
standing and the Depart-
ment has long since been
made acquainted with par-
ticulars of the same.</p>

<p>Dr. <unclear/> now appears
again to the Government at
the United States. Through
the Department of State
for some relief from the
burden under which he
is laboring.</p>

<pb facs="133543.jpg"/>

<p>To my own knowledge he
(Dr. <unclear/>) is internally in-
solvent, and is consquently
so pressed by his <unclear/>
on all sides as to be <unclear/>
ly hampered in the pros-
ecution of his <unclear/></p>

<p>By his <unclear/> and
intelligent efforts he has
developed his sugar plan-
tation to such a state of
perfection as to make it
(<unclear/>) a most
desirable property.</p>

<p>But with its present debt
it is quite impossible for
him to work it to a profit</p>

<p>There is no doubt
that had the King of Johanna
not taken the contemptable
action he did to injure
his prospects he (Dr. Wilson)
would have been now in
a position to realize large
benefits from his impier-
ed Estate.</p>

<pb facs="133609.jpg"/>

<p>In September 1885 when
Commander J F Barninton
visited Johanna in the
"<unclear/>" he made inquiry
into the matter as far as
was possible but it was
very difficult to get any
one to go on board he
"<unclear/>" to testify against
the King. Knowing that at
the moment the vessel felt
they would be punished
for so doing</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson has when
opportunity offered obtain-
ed what evidence he could
bearing in his case: and
I am sending the same
herewith as per the sub-
joined list of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>When Caption Patten
was at Johanna in the
'Lancaster' in april of last
year he was inclined to
take some claim in the
matter</p>

<pb facs="133616.jpg"/>

<p>matter. But the admiral
of the French gun boat
"<unclear/>" in the harbor bear-
ing the Commandant of the
Mayatta with instan claim
from his Government to take
over the Protectorate of the
Island. put a new phase
in the affair and the
'Lancaster' returned in good
<unclear/>.</p>

<p>It would appear that
the King was cerced into
signing the treaty with the
French in account of the
presence of an American
man of war in port from
the fact that he afterwards
protested against receiving
the French resident who
was finally landed by
<unclear/> in april of this year.</p>

<p>I am informed that
the President has recently
been negotiating a new
treaty</p>

<pb facs="133632.jpg"/>

<p>treaty with the King. But I
have no idea what terms
have been made.</p>

<p>From all that I
have been able to learn
Dr. Wilson is a <unclear/>
by the King's interference
cannot be less than 300,000.</p>

<p>Besides which he has
been a sufferer from
defamation of character
and from attempts on
his life.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would
not be out of place for
me to say here that I
have yet to hear one word
of derogation of his char-
acter in business methods
-this among my acquain-
taince in in Mauritius Réunion
Madagascar and <unclear/>.</p>

<p>If this were not the case
I imagine that he would
long since have been
compelled</p>

<pb facs="133648.jpg"/>

<p>compelled to have retired
from the field.</p>

<p>Trusting that the
Department will give this
matter the attention to which
I believe it is <unclear/>.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,
Regarding your claim against the King of Johanna
for indemnity for the loss you have suffered through his
interference with you labour supply during the past four
years, we can say that we are well aware of the serious
injury done to you and <unclear/> by the large reduction in
the quantity of sugar produce by Patsy Estate resulting
from that interference.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that had the Sultan not
compelled a large number of your labourers to leave your
employment with the object of crippling your operations,
you would see this time have been able to repay as the
important advances of funds we made to you through <unclear/>
<unclear/> for the purpose of working your Estate.
Your claim for an indemnity is therefor clearly just
and indisputable and we trust the United States Government
will inforce its payment as soon as possible.</p>

<p>With reference to the representations which we
learn have been made to your government by some evil
<unclear/> persons, reflecting on your moral character, we can
only say they are false and malicious. During the last
year we have been intimatley acquainted with you: we
have therefore had every opportunity of observing your
behavior both here and in Johanna, and we are bound to</p>

<p><unclear/>, Johanna
May, 1887</p>

<p>Dear Sir Wilson,
Having been requested to act as an effort in
estimating the damges you suffered through the acts of Sultan
Abdallah, and being personally acquainted with the affairs and
also with the <unclear/> conduct of Sultan Abdallah, towards you,
I hereby state my opinion in the matter.</p>

<p>I know very well that the Sultan threatened
your life by giving orders to his armed men to short you when
they would get a chance of doing so; as you did not give
them the opportunity, the plot failed, but it is nevertheless clear
that the detention in your house through threats of being shot at,
prevented you from attending to the work of you plantation, as well
as to any other business you may have had in hand. I have seen
also in your house several places where the boards had been cut
through by bullters fired in the night and evidently intended for
you. I know also of the <unclear/> and sinking of your
steam launch while at her anchorage, and of the stealing of anchors
and chains in your boat shed, all acts perpetrated by the Sultan's
men and by his orders.</p>

<p>Regarding your labour, it is very well known to me and
to every one in the island that in the year <unclear>1883</unclear> the Sultan took
away some hundred free men who were working for you, and
gave orders to the Johanna men to withdraw from your employment
any and all the places they had in it. His taking place which
you were in full <unclear/> interfered not only with that <unclear/>, but with
those that followed, as it prevented you from doing your planting and</p>

<pb facs="134026.jpg"/>

<p>and many other important works.</p>

<p>From the quantities of sugar you made during the
preceding years, that is from 1879 to 1882 included, it is evident
that during that period your crops were increasing by about
one hundred tons every year. In the year 1883, <unclear/> of the 
Sultan's interference, you made only half the quantities of sugar
of the preceding year, or three hundred tons less than you should
have made had you not been interfered with by the Sultan.</p>

<p>The following years, 1884 to 1886, show a slight increase
but not in a ratio with the first alluded to (1879-1882), and I should
say that in those three last years (1884-1886) your yearly loss was
as heavy as in 1883, or about three hundred tons yearly, making
a total loss for the four years 1880-1886 of twelve hundred tons
which, at the Mauritius market prices during these years would
be with, with interest, Ro 300,000.</p>

<p>The above I consider to be as near as possible your losses
from the Sultan's interference with your labour in 1880 and 1886, not
speaking of the aforementioned attempts at your life, to, and
the general inconvenience you were put to by such <unclear/>
acts.</p>

<p>Trusting that the US Government will give to your
case all the attention it deserves, and that you may some day
be compensated for your losses,
I remain, Dear Doctor
very sincerely yours

<p>Dear Sir
In reply to your
communication asking for any information
known to me concerning your late troubles
with the Sultan Abdallah and for which you are
claiming an indemnity, I can state that
your labour supply was almost entirely taken
away from you leaving scarcely sufficiant
people to gather in your crop, thus neglecting
all necessary work for Sultan can, such as
planting, working etc. Knowing as I do the
progress made in yields during the first ten years
cultivation of virgin land I can assert that
your losses must have been enormous.</p>

<p>From the bullet holes I have seen in your house
which were made by the Sultan's soldiers when
passing through your estate I consider your
life to have been in great danger. Indeed
I know that it was so threatened that you
had to exercise great caution when in moving
round your house and were entirely prevented
from attending to your <unclear/> work. No one
can entertain any doubt about your
losses under such circumstances and
I hope that your government will give you</p>

<p>Dear Sir
Having been compelled by force when
imprisoned at <unclear/> by Sultan Abdallah to
male a false statement concering you, I now
wish to declare and publish that that statement
was false, it was written by Sultan Abdallah for
his own purpose and I was forced to sign it under
penalty of death if I did not. The statement
that he made me sign was that you had given
me money to hire men to go and fight for
Prince Mohamed and that you would pay
ten dollars per head for slaves and fifty dollars
for free men an in case a slave died or was
killed you would pay fifty dollars to his master.</p>

<p>All this I now <unclear/> swear is false,
I wish have to to state also that I have often heard
Sultan Abdallah say that he intended to drive you
away from Johanna and take your plantation for
his own benefit and that of his son <unclear/>. I have
heard him <unclear/> this intention many times

and his borther Price Mohamed. Since

Merchants.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,
As you requested when I went to Johanna on behalf of
the Oriental Bank Corporation and the <unclear/> of <unclear/> to inspect
and report when the Sultan's sugar estate at Bauban: I thouroughly
inspected the estate "Patsy" belonging to Doctor Wilson. I found
"Patsy" estate very well managed indeed, the canes well cultivated,
and the plant of machinery in good order. I should judge that
Dr. Wilson will this coming season turn out about 400 tons of sugar,
and I see as reason why he should not go on increasing his
production yearly, say from 40 to 100 tons until he makes 800 to 900
tons per <unclear/>. Dr. Wilson has done a great deal of hard and
intelligent work at Patsy, and it is my opinion that had his labour
not been interfered with by the Sultan since 1882 (when he made
527 tons of sugar) that he would have been making the 800 to 900 tons
annually since /86.</p>

<p>Doctor Wilson's losses from the cause above alluded to, I
am sure cannot be less than one hundred thousand pounds planting, taking
into conisderation the heavy fall in prices of sugar since that time,
without, re re, besides the loss of a certain quantity of canes abandoned
and left in the ground, the latter taking from the <unclear/> the necessary
proportion for future cultivation of them.</p>

<p>The French Protectorate will I hope and trust work well
for future operations as there is an abundance of labour on the island,
and the men want to work, but as it appears were only detered
from doing so by the Sultan who evidently does not wish to see</p>

<pb facs="134437.jpg"/>

<p><unclear/> in his island, with the Protectorate he will not
be allowed to interfere.</p>

<p>I do not consider that there is any wish whatever in
making <unclear/> to Dr. Wilson for working his estate.
I remain, Dear Sir,

<p>I hereby certify that I was present when Dr. Wilson
made a settlement with Sultan Abdallah and heard
Sultan Abdallah insist upon Dr. WIlson's paying him
interest for goods that he had had from the Sultan
from the date they were <unclear/> until time of settlement,
had heard Dr. Wilson parted, but he had to give in to
the Sultan in order to come to some settlement with him.
It was well known that the Sultan had agreed to
supply Dr. Wilson with everything he required to make
a plantation without charging him anything until
his plantation was paying. This was offered him for
the services he rendered to Sultan Abdallah.

<pb facs="134527.jpg"/>

<p>Johanna, 26th April 1886</p>

<p>Dr. B.F. Wilson has made <unclear/> tons of sugar in 1887. At the
commencement of the 1882 crop he was deprived of labour by
Sultan Abdallah, so that he could not extende his plantation,
and it has been invariably the same every year since that time
(1882). so that instead of increasing his production of sugar
yearly as he might have done had he had the required labour,
it has fallen off, so that his last crop was only 227 tons;
whereas he might have made, if not interfered with, 900 tons of
sugar the last season: the estate being able to produce about
1500 tons of sugar, if all is put under cultivation.</p>

<p>It is a very easy matter for a crop to be largely reduced by
want of labour during one season; but is very difficult, and
requires much time to increase it again. It will take Dr. Wilson
at least four years to get his production of sugar what it
would have been had he not been interfered with.</p>

<p>I have had much experience on sugar plantations, being an
agricultural chemist, and I consider myself well able to judge
in this case, having spent the last twelve years in sugar
colonies.</p>

<p>Another important consideration in connection with Dr. Wilson's
losses is the fall in the price of sugars for the last two years,
which has been more than 30%; as even if Dr. Wilson can
produce the same quantity of sugar as he had been able to
produce before, he could not get the same profit.

<p>In days age when the USS Lancaster was here Captin
<unclear/> received from Sultan Abdallah a letter containing
I have been told so, false statements against Dr. Wilson,
and placing him under a very dalse position; this letter,
bearing the signature of Prince Mohamed. <unclear/> Dr. Wilson
knew this he made some inquiries and learned, positively,
that Prince Mohamed never wrote the letter refered to, nor
any other letter to Captain Potter, but that this letter was
written by a fellow SS Abdallah, by his orders, and falsely
signed Mohamed. Having got this information, Dr. Wilson
asked Captain Potter to send an officer with the letter to
Prince Mohamed to ascertain the fact. The Lancaster being
ready to sail and under steam, no officer could go
shore, and Captain Potter refered Dr. Wilson to the
Commandant of Mayotte who was on shore making
a treaty with S. Abdallah.</p>

<p>I was present when Dr. Wilson asked the Commandant
of Mayotte to call Prince Mohamed and make an
inquiry on this letter falsely signed by him. Commandant
of Mayotte declined to make any inquiry.

<p>Mauritius, August 1st, 1886</p>

<p>I hereby certify that I was in Dr. Wilson's employ on
Patsy Estate for six years, and I have heard Sultan Abdallah
say on several occasions that he intended after Dr. Wilson
had got his estate in good working condition, to drive Dr.
Wilson from the island, and get his estate away from him,
and give it to his son Salim. He also promised to make
me manager of the estate if I would assist in getting Dr
Wilson into difficulties. I am personally acquainted with
Sultan Abdallah, and used to be very intimate with him.
He commenced to try and deprive Dr. Wilson of labour in
1882, and took away all his own slaves first from Dr.
Wilson, and <unclear/> of his <unclear/> Boney Malala, about 50 in
number. He requested them to leave Patsy without Dr.
Wilson's knowledge and go to his garden at <unclear/>.
He then tried to get all Hohanna men to take <unclear/> slaves
from Dr. Wilson's employ. At the same time he ordered
all free labourers to leave, which they did, as they were
afraid of the vengeance of the Sultan if they did not

<p>I hereby certify that i was at <unclear/> and employed by
Sultan Abdallah for the last five or six years, and I am witness to
the bad statement that Sultan Abdallah has given to Johannah men
because they were friendly to Dr. Wilson and because they would not
take their slaves away from his work when he ordered it, and swear
to lies to injure him.</p>

<p>I have also often heard Sultan Abdallah say that he would drive
Dr. Wilson from the island, and take his plantation from him.</p>

<p>I was present also when his soldiers came and reported that
they had sunk Dr. Wilson's steamer, and witnessed the great pleasure he
expressed at the feat. The soldier that headed this last business was a 
slave of his by name Ramiela. I also know that the anchor stolen
from Dr. Wilson was done by Sultan Abdallah's orders and given to the 
Captain of his <unclear/> by the name of <unclear/> Waley.</p>

<p>I was witness also at Sultan Abdallah sending the slave
Maragook away, so he could not be a witness of Dr. Wilson's.

<p>Mayotte, September 26th, 1886</p>

<p>I hereby certify that I was in the employ of Dr. B.F. Wilson, proprieter
of Patsy Estate when the Sultan Abdallah and his brother Mohamed were
quarreling and fighting, and I was requested to leave the work of Dr. Wilson
with many others of his employees, but this I declined to do, when
Sultan Abdallah sent an armed force to the estate of Dr. Wilson and
caused me to go to <unclear/>, where I was beaten and chained in irons
for sixteen days, and badly treated otherwise, because I would not swear
to lies to injure Dr. Wilson: but this I was at least obliged to do to save
my life, and now, being free, I am glad to be able to speak the truth.</p>

<p>Sultan Abdallah has often said he intended to get Dr. Wilson
into trouble and then drive him from the Island, so he could get his
plantation for his son Salim. When Dr. Wilson went to the Sultan
and requested him to send me back to the work, he wrote Dr. Wilson
that I refused to go. This is not true: I wished to go but he refused
to allow me to. When the "Juniata" was in Johanna he told
Captain Harrington that he had sent to Mayyotte for one to come
to Johanna as a witness: this is also not true: he never wrote to one
at all.</p>

<p>I <unclear/> Abass do hereby solemnly

bin Sultan's agent in procuring arms and ammunition
for him before the <unclear/> rebellion in this island. I applied
on several occasions to Dr. Wilson for assistance
which he invariably and <unclear/> refused to give me.
Saying he was on "<unclear/>" and would have nothing

going to Zanzibar and emplyed him to execute
the commission for me. When the <unclear/> <unclear/>
arrived here I asked for Dr. Wilson's permission to store

delivery of the whole mill the exception of a few
packages which I put into a <unclear/> boat.</p>

<p>I was authorized by Prince Mohamed to procure

our government had not taken notice
of any claims here. I have frequently
heard remarks <unclear/> from the Fren

Government have abandoned me and
my cse otherwise they would have mis
sed it long before this. They all know well
the justice of my claims but will try the
claim of bluff if they can. There are all
sorts of schemes afloat to try and be rid
of me and my case. I have very good
reason to believe and am offered wit
ness to prove that the Sultan here
made a written contract with the
French Resident here to send me out
of the Island and he agreed to do it!!
What can one expect from the French
or the Sultan after that unless they are
obliged by pressure to pay my inemnity.

<p>The Sultan is now trying another
scheme to deprive me of free labour
again yesterday all of my free labou
rers came to me saying they could
not work longer because the Sultan had
levied a poll tax of five and one half
dollars each to all that worked for me
but those not working for me had
only to pay one dollar and one half!!
This is only <unclear/> a time to drive my
labour away, I have informed the
men that I would write the Governor
of Mayotte who is chief of the Protectora

his reply. The most of them went to
work this morning. How far the Gover

<p>Honorable GL Roives
Assistant Secretary of State

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to advise
the Department that matters
remain quiet in Zanzibar
<unclear/>.</p>

<p>It is my belief <unclear/>
that a move is being con-
templated looking to the
emancipation of all the
slaves in the Island of
Zanzibar. The
Government of Great Britain
is the leading spiral- in
this movement, but they will
rationally expect the co-op
eration of the other nations.
Without which they would
very likely be <unclear/>
but <unclear/>. 
I</p>

<pb facs="143035.jpg"/>

<p>I should be gald to be in-
formed by the Department as
to what powers might to be
assumed by the United States
representatives in such an
event.</p>

<p>The Sultan, whatever his
private sentiments might be,
would protest vigorously
against any such movement
since the large Arab pop-
ulation would never submit
peacefully to such emanci-
pation of their slaves and
would withdraw their support
from the Sultan under the
defended their position.</p>

<p>Honorable G L Roives
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to address
the Department at this time
in relation to the condition of
affairs to the East Coast of
Afirca.</p>

<p>When I took my depart-
ure from Zanzibar in the 7th
of February, <unclear/> everything
was in a healthy condition
and a large volume of com
merce was being <unclear/>.</p>

<p>All of the ports on the main-
land were open to trade and
it was considered perfectly
safe for Europeans to travel
about anywhere on the vicin-
ity of the Coast ports without
<unclear/>
On</p>

<pb facs="143122.jpg"/>

<p>On the 27th of March 1888 the 
Sultan <unclear/> <unclear/> said
and his <unclear/> was fat-
tened by the accusion to the
throne of his brother. <unclear/>
Khalifa bin Said by right
of succession. Shortly
afterwards the German East
African Association repres-
ented by the German Consul
General M. <unclear/> began
pressing the Sultan to put
his signature to a conces-
sion. which had been grant-
ed by Seyed Bengarl: but 
which required the sanc-
tion of the present Sultan
to become effective.</p>

<p>This concession which is
for a term of Fifty years
takes over to the Association
all the power wich the
Sultan possessed in the main-
land and in all his terri-
tories and dependancies South
of</p>

<pb facs="143135.jpg"/>

<p>of the <unclear/> river. the whole
administration of which is
conceded to and placed in
their hands to be carried
out in the Sultan's home and
under his flag and subject
to the Sultan's sovereign rights.</p>

<p>The association is also grant-
ed the faculty of levying
taxes upon the people of the
main-land. etc etc etc.
It being clearly understood
however that all exercise
of these privileges and powers
shall be in conformity with
existing treaties between the
Sultan and Foreign states.</p>

<p>I have reason to
believe that the Sultan
protested repeatedly against
such transfer but was 
<unclear/> coerced into sign-
ing the concession- like
his brother before him who
is reported as saying after having</p>

<pb facs="143144.jpg"/>

<pb facs="143149.jpg"/>

<p>they were driven out of the
country by the <unclear/> natives.</p>

<p>On <unclear/> about the 20th
of December 188 the Imper-
ial British East Africa
Company through its rep-
resentative Mr. Mackenzie
obtained a concession from
the Sultan <unclear/> to that
granted to the German east
African Association and tak-
ing in the Sultan's territory
up to and beyond <unclear/>
The Company is not yet
in working under but up
to the present time <unclear/>
to good managment they
have met with no violent
opposition from the natives.</p>

<p>The present condition
of affairs on the East Coast
may be summed up as
fallen- trade is utterly
dead- some <unclear/> of
the British Indian subjects
who</p>

<pb facs="143155.jpg"/>

<p>who <unclear/> as natives claim
trading with the <unclear/>
are ruined- it is ren-
dered unsafe for Europeans
in any <unclear/> to <unclear/>
any of the Coast ports-
the blockade <unclear/> out
by Germany and England
assisted by Italy and Port-
ugal is a cause of dis-
trust to the natives
and lastly the Sultan
has lost <unclear/> in all the
European Governments but
<unclear/> put his trust in
the American Government.</p>

<p>In regard to the
blockade which was es-
tablished in the 3rd of Dec
ember last, in the name of
the Sultan that by his writ-
ten consent by the German
and English Admirals.</p>

<p>I should be glad to be

<p>if the blockade <unclear/> the
<unclear/> the night <unclear/>
and <unclear/> <unclear/>

flag.</p>

<p>In connection with the
blockade the German Admi-
ral has recently issued

the transportation of food
and provisions to port in
the Coast-line of the German
Association and limiting
native vessels resorting
to these ports to three days
supply of provisions.</p>

<p>On the 13th of last month
the Sultan issued a proc-
lamation (copy enclosed)
prohibiting his subjects
from dealing in arms and
ammunition and prohibiting
the importation and exporta-
tion of the same in the is-
land of Zanzibar and <unclear/>
I</p>

<pb facs="143206.jpg"/>

<p>I have been asked by the
German and English Consuls
General to cooperate with
them and to enforce the
provisions of the proclama-
tion on subjects of this
Consulate. I have not
seen fit to do so as yet.
I await the instructions
of the Department in the
matter.</p>

<p>Within the past week
the Sultan has advised me
that he has information that
the German Government con-
templates the establishment
of a garrison in the town
of Zanzibar. The Sultan
has grave fears not only
for the safety of his own
people but for that of all
the foreigners residing in
the town. I ran Mayotte
of opinion that such a
move on the part of Germany 
would</p>

<pb facs="143234.jpg"/>

<p>would surely give rise to
complications by which the
safety of all residents
would be <unclear/>.</p>

<p>Germany from the
<unclear/> has acted in this
matter in a high-handed
manner: and now, seconded
by England. Their actions
are getting to be <unclear/>
<unclear/>. The Sultan hopes
for the moral support at 
least of the United States.
I sincerely hope that this
support may be <unclear/>
by our Government: for it
is a <unclear/> fact that
the sovereign rights of
His Majesty the Sultan
of Zanzibar have been to-
tally disregarded and ig-
nored and he is practic-
ally powerless against
further aggressive move-
ments.

<p>I will say in closing that
up to the present time Amer-
ican interests have suffer-
ed in common with others
but I have reason to fear
that in the event of the
troubles extending to the
more northern ports Ameri-
can interests will be spec-
ially <unclear/>. This
would appear to be suffi-
ciant reason why the <unclear/>
<unclear/> right to be a fac-
tor in the movement which
is now shaping history on

I have the honor to inform
the Department that the last

one hundred <unclear/> who have
been engaged by the German
East African Company to help
fight- their <unclear/> on the coast</p>

<p>They were not alloweed to land

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to call
the attention of the Department
to the case of Dr B F Wilson
of Johanna. My
despatch number 25 of the
10th November 1887 gave
full particulars of this case.</p>

<p>I am enclosing herewith
three communications lately
received from Dr. Wilson
which give a pretty good
idea of the struggle he is
having to keep his head
above water. His case
is a desperate one and
I am certain that he is
practically bankrupt</p>

<p>There is no doubt
but</p>

<pb facs="144034.jpg"/>

<p>but for the Sultan's un-
warranted interference that
he would now be not ony
solvent but perfectly inde-
pendent.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson calls my atten-
tion to this clerical move in
the despatch of the Secretary
of State number 320 to Mr
McLane. Page 1 fifth
line from bottom should read
1872 instead of 1878. Page
2 of same despatch should 
read (in fifteenth line)
1884 instead of 1882.</p>

<p>I also observe in the same
page ninth line from the 
bottom that the word "wife"
should reade "life".</p>

<p>I trust that some
thing may be done for Dr
Wilson and that speedily
since it is not probable
that he can long continue
in procession of the Estate.</p>

the affair to the Governor of Mayotts but no <unclear/>
as yet has been taken of the affair and my letters
not seen been acknowledged by the first. Last 
month there was a new Governor appointed, to
Mayotts and I had the honor of calling upon
him on the 16th inst He mentioned having
received my communications and that of
the Acting Resident and spoke of the injustice
of the Sultan's conduct and I suppose it
will end there. No redress to be had.
Whenever I speak of my claims against
the Sultan they invariably say: "Your Government
have taken the matter in hand". I have
to three different Governors offered to show
my claim and documents but they always
decline to look at them. I cannot inquire
why my goverment does not do something
for me. It is now three years since the
"Quiniata" came here and the <unclear/>
made as thorough examination as was possible
at the time and I am sure his report <unclear/>
not have been otherwise than favorable to me.
Since then the "Lancaster" and "Alliance" have been here</p>

<pb facs="144445.jpg"/>

<p>have been here and give away without
<unclear/> maintaining on eof my claims
against the Sultan. Captain <unclear/> did make
some attempt to make inquiries, about it but
the Governor of Mayotts came in at the time in
a little gunboat to make a treaty with the Sultan
and take over the Protectorate and Captain
dropped everything and went away- the
Sultan has since and his son Salim have
said to me that they never would have made
a treaty with the French pleasing the <unclear/>
French protection if the "Lancaster" had not
been here. I calim to be an honorable,
respectable and patriotic citizen of the United
States and always have been <unclear/> think
I have a right to claim protection and
assitance as ends and I do not think I
am asking too much when I demand it.
In fact I think I should be recognized
as an <unclear/> if I did not. I always
fly the American flag from my home and
boat and when the rebellion of the Sultan's
brother was going on the American flag was
upon my home both day and night and
<unclear/> <unclear/> when by the same time by the
Sultan <unclear/>. I doubt not that
the US Government will take notice of the</p>

<pb facs="144453.jpg"/>

<p>time both when I have been
financially ruined by this Sultan and
without the slightest just some- and
under I got relief from I should be obliged
to comply with the Sultan's great desire-
- Abandon my plantation and property
and have the <unclear/> when the Sultan will
step in and get what he has always wanted
and quarreled for it.</p>

<p>I am informed by some intimate
friends in the employ of the French Goverment
that all of the officials of Mayotts are very
much afraid of me. They are afraid that
I will expose them and their so called
protectorate to the US Government. The
Protectorate as felt by all therefor is a <unclear/>
and the inhabitants are much worse off than
before with such a Resident as we have <unclear/>
<unclear/> the island of <unclear/> it is much the same.</p>

<p>The Sultan is assisted by the Resident to

Upon my return from Mayotts on the 26th inst
I found a large number of my <unclear/> <unclear/>

they came to me and made their formal complaint
that they <unclear/> the work because the Sultan Abdallah

On the 29th ultimo I <unclear/> to your Excellency upon

mine were as taxed.</p>

Yesterday the 26th instant two armed policement
of the Sultan Abdallah- one by the name of Bakkam

the Sultan and went to the <unclear/> of <unclear/> and
demanded from each male working upon this estate
the sum of four dollars and in case they did not
or could not pay this sum they were to take them to

replied that they had not the money and could not
pay but if they would let them work and earn money
they would pay. These armed policement then demanded
one <unclear/> from each resident in the village for their
trouble and promised to report to the Sultan. These
men not having the money to pay the policement
they have <unclear/> them from going to their work
today. Hearing that any men did not come

<p>A E B Govea <unclear/>
Acting US Consul
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Dear Sir
My last <unclear/>
from you was on the 7th of August, I have
written to you by every mail (although not
officially) but hear <unclear/>thing from you. I
am anxious to know the result of your
interview with His Highness Prince Said
Alli. the Sultan brother as I know he
wold tell what he knows now of his brother's
conduct toward me not being on friendly
terms with his brother. I was obliged
to go to Mayotts to meet the lord <unclear/> from
Mauritius and on business. I there <unclear/>
the said said alli and asked him again
if at this time what he had told me before
about the Sultan offering the French Resident
a sum of money if he would get me out
of the island and the Resident <unclear/>
the offer and a paper was <unclear/> what
the <unclear/> agreeing to give the Said <unclear/>
the money if he would do it. He said <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="144613.jpg"/>

<p>it was time. He said he did not like to swear
to before you when at Zanzibar because he
feared the French Resident but now the Resident
had left for France he would do it before
say today I wished him to. I thought it
not best to take him before any French
Authorities at Mayotts for that purpose
and there being no other nation represented
at Mayotts. I asked him to give me a 
document stating the facts and apply his
Seal to it and have a witness to it. this he
very willingly did and I have the honor
of enclosing it herewith with a translation
of the same made by the Interpreter and translator-
of the French Resident here. I should
think that this with all of the other documents
procured by one and the <unclear/> taken
by Captain Harringotn of the <unclear/> when
there ought to <unclear/> the US Government
of the justice of my claim and demand
as an American Citizen. I claim to
be a citizen of the United States and an honorable
one too and of unimpeachable <unclear/>
and have always well represented my
country and as such I think I have
a right to demand protection and
my country should give it to me or</p>

<pb facs="144620.jpg"/>

<p>or give me some reason why I am
not entitled to respect and consideration
as an American- It is now four years
since I have made my complaint and
claims and not one word have I heard
from my Government and I am sure
there is not one person who knows of my
treatment here but acknowledges the justness
of my claims. It is well known that where
I came upon this island that I did not come
here seeking a place but far from it I came
here as a passenger and companion of the
owner of the "ES "<unclear/>" Capt. C W <unclear/> of
the firm of GS Holmes <unclear/> of Cape Town and
was <unclear/> by promises and written engage-
ments made by the Sultan to remain here.
When he saw after my being here eight
years that I was prospering he through jealou-
sy wished to make it so unpleasant for me
that I would abandon all of my hard
earnings to him and leave the island but
he has not succeeded as yet and when the
"<unclear/>" was here he tried to make it appear
that I had forfited my right to American
Citizenship although he knew the contrary.

and over my magazin at the beach and my

This paper is to say that we were at <unclear/>

called the Resident and told him to do all that
it was possible for him to do and take Doctor Wilson
out of the island and make him pay the money
he wished from Doctor Wilson and he would then
take the Patsy property and give it to his son
Salim bin Sultan Abdallah.</p>

<p>The Sultan agreed in our presence to give
the Resident Monsieur <unclear/> the sum of
forty thousand dollars if he would do that:
M. <unclear/> accepted this proposition and said
he would do it. Then Sultan Abdallah ordered
Salim his son to draw up a paper to that
effect which was fone and we signed it as
witnesses <unclear/>. Said Alli bin Suntan Salim Jaffa

<p>Dear Sir
I last sent to you
on the 26th of December and since then have
not heard from you. I am <unclear/>
your letters by the mail <unclear/> Mayotts on
the 2nd of next month. I <unclear/>
<unclear/> to you more particularly this time
to show you what the French Protectorate
<unclear/> to here so far as any one but
a French subject is concerned.</p>

<p>I applied to the Resident upon the 24th of
November and again on the 31st of December
for assistance and to bring to justice <unclear/>
for putting fires upon my estate and
destroying my young forest plantation.</p>

<p>(Copies of my letter herewith enclosed)
The Resident did all that was necessary on
his part. (with the exception of replying in
writing to my letters) (2 have not received one
<unclear/> in writing from him). He came and
investigated this burnt land and a <unclear/>
of the Estate with the burnt land whom was given
to him and he said he considered it a
very serious offense and he <unclear/> to the
Governor of Mayotts upon the subject sent</p>

<pb facs="144724.jpg"/>

<p>asked for instructions to know how to proceed
in the matter. There has been three <unclear/>
from there since then but no note taken
of my complaint. I asked <unclear/>
what one could do and he replied the only
thing is to write to your Consul about it.</p>

<p>There was a sort of a <unclear/> and <unclear/>
of all of the labourers on <unclear/> Estate <unclear/>.
Mr <unclear/> proprietor and English subject- He
applied for assistance and the Resident went
there and made some talk and reported
it to the Governor of Mayotts but he did
nothing about it and <unclear/> was <unclear/>
to yield to the labourers much to his
regret and to all others who pay for their
labour. His labourers have written a four
days demanded farther <unclear/>.
In november Mr <unclear/> was obliged to
submit to them or lose his crop; <unclear/>
was only a few who would not allow the
others to work.</p>

<p>I judge from the conduct of the
French Government it is evident that they
wish to drive all strangers out of this island
<unclear/> there is a large <unclear/>
formed that has special privilege
<unclear/> by the Government and they were
<unclear/> by the French Minister in <unclear/>
that no one but French subjects should be
allowed to have shares in the Company!</p>

<pb facs="144736.jpg"/>

<p>Of course that is not very <unclear/> <unclear/>
but their own but it shows that they do
not wish strangers <unclear/> their government in
their islands.</p>

<p>We have a new Resident here now a <unclear/>
<unclear/>. I have called upon him and
forward him very pleasant and <unclear/>
. He returned my call on the 25th and the
same day about one hour after he left
my residence another fire was put
into the <unclear/> and burnt over an hour
but of young trees. I have not written
to him or reputed it for the reason that
I see it is useless and I believe that
last <unclear/> were put because I reported
the first was to the Resident. I <unclear/>
all the men on the place and put out the
fire before it had done a great deal of
damage. The fact is the Residents
have no power to do any thing for
me and the Governor of Mayotts does
not wish to.</p>

<p>I report these facts to you
and you may know of something to
do on the US Government.

<p><unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/>
Acting French Resident
Johanna</p>

<p>Sir
It is with regret that I
am obliged to write to you the following
complaint <unclear/> On Sunday last the 18th <unclear/>
fire was put in the grass upon this estate, and
burnt over upwards of three hundred acres of
land. The majority of which was planted
with young trees and all were destroyed by the
fire. The fire extended so rapidly that my
residence and dependencies were at one time
in great danger. So much as that I was
obliged to have men upon them with water to
extinguish any fire that came.</p>

<p>My canes were also in great danger, and
Mr Magny was obliged to turn out all of the men
possible to fight the fire and prevent it entering
the canes.</p>

<p>The damage and anxiety gave
cannot well imagine not being present at the
time.</p>

<p>It is very well known by all of the Residents
upon this island that for the last ten years I have
been doing my <unclear/> to get the bare <unclear/>
<unclear/> with young trees, and have annually planted them</p>

<pb facs="144805.jpg"/>

<p>nearly every year some one puts fire into
the grass, and they are destroyed. Upon
some occasion when we have caught the persons
they have been punished lightly and let off--to
apply to the Sultan for assistance is useless, as he considers
it such a trifling affair, and not affecting his <unclear/>.</p>

<p>Last year I had a man imprisoned for putting
fire: He escaped and went to the Sultan who protected
him from any punishment. Such persons
require to be severely dealt with, and it is for this
reason that I come to you trusting that justice
may be done. My patience is getting exhausted
in trying to cultivate trees, by having them year after
year burnt down. One of the men who put
this last fire I now have in prison: One other
escaped.</p>

<p>Trusting that you will investigate this
matter, and on the <unclear/> property punished
and with much respect
I am
Your obedient servant

Knowing that you was very much <unclear/> in

Johanna 25 June 1889</p>

<p>Seth A Pratt <unclear/>
US Consul
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
I last wrote to you on the 19th inst
and sent letters by the American Whaler
"<unclear/>" and no doubt you have on this
received them. I however enclose <unclear/> copies
of the same herewith. I wrote to you that
three Johannamen were on their way to you
to give their testimony and to be away from the
vengeance of the Sultan. One of my men <unclear/>
has got as far as <unclear/> but the other two
Aloe Shi and Halliday Shi were arrested as they
were on the point of embarking in a <unclear/>
on bord of <unclear/>, vessel, they were imprisoned
for the night and in the morning taken before the
Sultan who abused and threatened them all he
knew how and will not permit any <unclear/>
leave in the night for fear they may get on boat
and get away and give evidence against him
these two men have <unclear/> written statements what
I have had "englishigen" and at their request here
with enclose to you. It simply shows what</p>

<pb facs="150144.jpg"/>

<p>what means and devices this old tyrant
will use to further his own ends. The French
handle him pretty roughly at times but when
he demands pardon their all <unclear/> and they
are as thick and happy as bees together <unclear/>
I am anxious to know how the
arbitrating business in my case is to be <unclear/></p>

<p>If the Resident and French Government
call their 'enquete' <unclear/>proper investigation I
do not and under every point I have
demanded is given into I certainly protests
against it. Here the Resident calls every
one he chooses and asks any question he chooses
without my reviewing nay thing about it
on an opportunity of reputing any false
statements: butso far as I can learn
they cannot bring one such thing against
one although they trouble the affairs of
supplies to his brother which I think they
have given to that they have not a leg to stand
on there. They might as well accuse you as me.
But over there, that was not the government
of my grievances and the serious ones <unclear/>. His
brother only rebelled in 1884 and my brother <unclear/>
1882. If all works welle here I intend going
home on this business and I am glad we
have the Hon: <unclear/> to the which <unclear/>
of the Hon. <unclear/>. I cannot imagine</p>

<pb facs="150151.jpg"/>

<p>the Hon. <unclear/> <unclear/> such
a treaty as the French have here. <unclear/>
they are not <unclear/> for anything and
as <unclear/> claim hold the Salim <unclear/>.
I have been writing to the Resident about
the salve trade treaty here with the English and
requested a reply to my letter but he would
not write but came not to see me. He did not
recognize the English treaty at all. He <unclear/> they
have made a treaty since <unclear/> holds the slave
five years <unclear/>. Of course the English
COnsul at Zanzibar will know about this
and I wish you would call upon this matter.
According to the English treaty all slaves are
to be absolutely free in August next, French
say free yes but they must work for their
masters five years more once they engage
for another five years!! I think "<unclear/>"
will grow under that business. Anyone
can buy a slaves labour now for 150 <unclear/> for
five years if he wishes. I would like to
know the English opinion of it. Of course
slaves are bought and sold here daily and have been
here since the English treaty and their a which
French have "the ball". They say the English have
not <unclear/> in talk any notes of the treaty.
Hoping to hear from you soon and patiently
I am your obedient servant
B F Wilson</p>

<p>Patsy Estate
Johanna 29 July 1889</p>

<p>Seth A Pratt <unclear/>
US Consul
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Sir:
Your two valuable favors of the
date 31st May and 2nd July duly to hand
by this months courrier. The USS <unclear/>
was too late to be of any service as regards the
enquiry and I do not know but it is all
for the best that there was no <unclear/> here or
no representant of my government. I never
feared any thing but false statements and
lies and my truly reason for mounting a
<unclear/> myself on a US government office
that could prove that but as they have had
all their own many they cannot <unclear/>
find any fault. The only thing I
fear now is that the US government will
be too <unclear/> and not push any claim.</p>

<p>I received a letter rom Baron <unclear/> by
the last mail. (a <unclear/>) He says that
my government have not proved my claim
and they will have to if I am <unclear/>.
Do you think I should go home for
that purpose? It is now <unclear/> <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="150207.jpg"/>

<p>and I would not like to leave here unless
necessary. Still I could do so. I could
only <unclear/> some facts and important ones
which perhaps have not been written but if
the US Government observe well all that has
been sent to the Department of State since 1884
they will have my <unclear/> pretty well. I know
the French Government will wish to get out of
it by saying the King cannot pay. He has nothing
they say. He could have paid and would
have paid if the French had kept out of these
islands. I consider now that they are
responsible for the Sultan and I have good
French Authority also for saying this. His
section is <unclear/> and they are responsible.</p>

<p>I am astonished that the US Government
and the English Government also did not
object from the <unclear/> to me on two articles
in their treaty of the Protectorate. Perhaps they
have. Certainly Mr. Blains will bring
them to this hearing.</p>

<p>You no doubt have had the "<unclear/>" with
you on this. It does my heart good
to see an American man of war: they
are altogether <unclear/>.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear good news
from you and the Department of State
I am Your obedient servant
B F Wilson</p>

<p>Translation of letter of Aloe Shi <unclear/></p>

<p>I Aloe Shi Dreyman do hereby swear by the <unclear>Koran</unclear> that
I went to French Resident of Johanna these
days in succession and <unclear/> three different
times to give my testimony while he was making the
enquiry. I want to tell what I know that Sultan
Abdallah had done to Dr. Wilson and these times
I was acomanied by Halliday Shi. On the third
day the Resident told us he would not take our statements
at all. <unclear/> the same time he was taking the
statements of men who Sultan Abdallah sent. We
came to the conclusion (Halliday and myself) that we
would go to Zanzibar and make our statements there
and intended to letter passage in the vessel of <unclear/>
<unclear/> ("<unclear/>") but were taken and imprisoned
by the Police of the Sultan and kept in prison until morning
when we were taken before the Sultan. <unclear/> said to 
us "you wish to run away and go to sea". The reason
that we wished to go to Zanzibar was that the Sultan
sent to me one Said Omar and told me that
I must go before the Resident and swear that
the <unclear/> agreed to give me three thousand dollars
if I would be witness for him. I informed this
<unclear/> that I could not tell such a lie about the
<unclear/> but he <unclear/> should go and tell this to the Resident <unclear/>
will give him one hundred dollars, <unclear/>
<unclear/> Sultan called me to the <unclear/>
<unclear/> I was an <unclear/> <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="150259.jpg"/>

<p>one hundred and twenty six dollars and of the
American government does not liking will this
Sultan will kill us. He likes me also that he would not
allow me to go to Patsy to Dr Wilson, and I want the
US Consul to know all of this.

<p>Translation of the <unclear/> letter of Halliday Shi <unclear/>
<unclear/> <unclear/></p>

<p>Halliday Shi <unclear/> <unclear/> of the treaty <unclear/>
<unclear/> the <unclear/> that all that I have <unclear/> is <unclear/>.
I went to the Residentof <unclear/> in Johanna at three
different times to tell what I know about the Sultan
Abdallah and Dr. Wilson. I went to the Resident
accompanied by Aloe Shi and on the third
day he told me and Aloe Shi that he would not take
<unclear/> more evidence at all but when Sultan
Abdallah men came to him he took their evidence.</p>

<p>Aloe Shi and myself wished to go to Zanzibar
to give our evidence there and attempted to
go aboard of the American ship <unclear/>
and the Sultan sent his police and arrested
us and put us in prison until morning and
said to us that we wanted to run away and
take Abdallah called me to his house and <unclear/>
<unclear/> and for the reason that I wished to be a witness
for Dr Wilson. He called me in his <unclear/> an <unclear/>
and all of this is <unclear/>. If we do not get relief
from this man we will die. And all of his people
say that if he the Sultan gets the best of <unclear/> in
his <unclear/> he will cut off all of the heads that
had given evidence against him. You must
<unclear/>him of <unclear/> the truth onth that, I say,
