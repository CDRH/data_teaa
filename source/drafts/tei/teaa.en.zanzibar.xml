<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Zanzibar, January 11 1891</p>

<p>Honorable Wm F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honour to
forward herewith copies of a
correspondence relating to an
additional duty levied on
imports to the German East
African Coast of Zanzibar,
and to address the Department
briefly regarding the same</p>

<p>The Dominion of the
Sultan of Zanzibar formerly
comprised the whole of the
East Central African Coast
and adjacent islands until
this year, when the Sultan
was induced by Germany
<catchwords>and England</catchwords>

<pb facs="155735"/>

and England to sell
to the former his sovereign
rights in about 400 miles
of this Coast, (transferred <unclear>2nd</unclear>/1/91)
leaving for himself the
islands of Zanzibar and
Bomba and a small piece
of Coast to the North, all
under a British Protectorate.</p>

<p>By the treaties with
Zanzibar, it is specially
provided that goods which
have paid 5% duty once
shall pass free through
any ports of Zanzibar
territory, and it has been
customary to import to
the island of Zanzibar
all goods intended for
East African trade and
paying duty there, <unclear extent="one word"/>
to the various Coast ports,
the island acting merely
as a distributing center
and not as a <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<pb facs="155740"/>

<p>On December 22d last,
notice was received from
the German Consulate,
that, from Jan'y 1, 1891,
"the duty" would be taken
on the German Coast
for account of the German
Government, meaning that
5% duty would be levied
on all goods imported to 
the German Coast, whether
they had previously paid
to the Zanzibar Customs 
or not. This duty is
now in force there.</p>

<p>The American house
of Mess. Roper, <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co.
hold in this city a lot of
goods destined expressly
for the German Coast, on
which they have paid 5%
duty to the Zanzibar Customs,
and on their representing
this fact to me and also
the impossibility of making
<catchwords>shipping</catchwords>

<pb facs="155746"/>

shipping and storage
arrangements in the
space of eight days. I
filed a protest against
this duty being levied
with the German Consul,
as per copy inclosed.</p>

<p>At the same time
I addressed H. H. the Sultan
through the British Agency,
protesting against another
duty being allowed to be
charged on goods already
passed at Zanzibar, and
claimed a free market,
or a drawback on all
American duty-paid goods
here for export to said Coast.
In reply, the British Agent
states that he is in a
similar situation in regard
to British subjects and is
unable to make any statement 
until he is advised
by his Government, to
<catchwords><unclear extent="one word"/></catchwords></p>

<pb facs="155750"/>

<gap extent="one page" reason="illegible image"/>

<pb facs="155757"/>

<p>I am of the opinion
that, as the Sultan only
could sell something that
he possessed and he never
possessed the right to levy
a second duty of 5% on
goods duty-paid in Zanzibar, 
the Germans have
no legal rights to levy
such duty, and the 
Sultan is responsible for
allowing this state of things
(of course it being understood 
that the Sultan
is but a name, England
being the responsible party)
As contracting party to
the treaties the Sultan
has agreed that one duty
of 5% passes all goods free
through all ports of his
dominions, and I believe
him to be responsible for
any <unclear extent="one word"/> caused by a
transfer of any port of
his dominions

<pb facs="155801"/>

without any notice whatever 
to the Treaty Powers.</p>

<p>The amount claimed
by Mess. Roper, <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co
is 5% drawback on $44,746.00
value of duty-paid goods
specially imported for-sale 
on the German Coast
and held by them in the
city of Zanzibar on the
1st of January 1891 say
$2,237.30, and in submitting
this claim to the Department 
I consider that we
have a clear case against
the Sultan through the
English Protectorate, and
trust that the Department
will endorse my opinion
and take proceedings
towards payment of the claim.</p>

<p>Sir:
Understanding that you
have taken charge of the
Foreign Relations of HH the Sultan,
I have the honour to request that
you bring to the notice of His
Highness' Government the following,</p>

<p>The American house of
Roper, <unclear/> hold in this
city, a quantity of goods on which
they have paid 5% duty to the
Zanzibar Customs. Under
existing treaties, one payment
of 5% admits goods free to all
ports and parts of the Sultan's
Dominions, and in good faith
under this treaty right, these
goods were imported from the
United States</p>

<p>To
Sir C B <unclear/> Smith <unclear/>
<unclear/> agent and Consul <unclear/>
Zanzibar</p>

<pb facs="155900"/>

<p>United States, especially for trade
in that portion of His Higness'
Dominions leased to the German
East African Company.</p>

<p>On the 22nd inst, I received
notice from the German Consulate
that from January 1st 1891, duty
would be taken on the German
East African coast for account
of the German government, from
which I infer that some transfer
in the Coast Government has
been made although no notice
of any such transfer has been
received from anyone, at this
Consulate.</p>

<p>If this additional duty
is allowed to be levied on the
Coast at nine days notice, I am
of the opinion that a drawback
of 5% should be allowed by
HH the Sultan to <unclear/>
on all duty-paid goods held
by them</p>

<pb facs="155914"/>

<p>by them now in Zanzibar
and which can only find a
market on the German Coast,
or that some arrangement should
be made between HH the Sultan
and the German authorities, by
which these goods may be
imported free into the German
Coast within a reasonable time,
say six months.</p>

<p>I presume that, in the
future <unclear/> for the
German Coast via Zanzibar
may be transhipped in bond,
if, in the meantime, no more
favorable arrangement is made.</p>

be glad to receive the views of
His Higness' Government on
the foregoing, in time to trans-
mit to my government by the

<p>Sir:
I have the honour to
ackowledge receipt of your
letter dated the 29th inst. on the
subject of an intimation which
upon have received that after the
1st of January 1891, the German
Coast <unclear/> will proceed to levy
<unclear/> duties upon the German
East African Coast Line on account
of the German government.</p>

<p>You are of the opinion that

goods already imported into
Zanzibar destined for import into
the German Coast Line and
which have already paid duty
to the</p>

a drawback of 5% should be
allowed by His Highness the
Sultan on all duty paid goods
held by American subjects.</p>

ion of my opinion on the Represen-
tations of the Protesting Power in
Zanzibar regarding the position

but destined for the German Coast.
You require whether or not such
merchandise can be transhipped

arrangement be made.</p>

<p>Subject:
Trade and Political Affairs</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.
Effect of additional Coast duty.
Transhipmens in bond.
Zanzibar a free-port considered.
Total prohibition of importation
of cheap spirits aducated.
Transfer of judicial powers to
British coast.
Remarks on Zanzibar being made
a British Colony.
(This is <unclear/>)</p>

<pb facs="160338"/>

<p>British Government
propose to take regarding
the numerous protests
and claims arising from 
this arbitrary Coast duty,
and nothing has occurred
to shake me in my opinion
that the Sultan is
responisble for a 5% drraw-
back on all duty-paid
goods held by American
merchants on January 1st 91
for German Coast trade.</p>

<p>The question of
making Zanzibar a free
port has been agitated
for some time and meets
with the approval of all
friends of Zanzibar and
as nearly everything is
now passed in bond, the
law to the Sultan would
be only the <unclear/> on
imports consumed in
the islands of Zanzibar
and <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="160347"/>

<p>and <unclear/> and <unclear/>
islands, which <unclear/>
I do not estimate at more
than coast of collecting.
It would therefore appear
that there is no obstacle
in making this a free
port, but the treaties pro-
vide that the Sultan
must provide suitable
Custom House and go-downs
and transhipment stores,
free of all storage charges
other than the 5% duty
take away this duty and 
we have the Sultan rem-
oving a Custom House for
nothing- Of course he
objects- It will therefore
be necessary to alter the
treaties to make this a
free port and any such
alterations would probably
be opposed by Germany
as against the interests
of the</p>

<pb facs="160350"/>

<p>Coast Colony opposite
as it doubtless would be.
it is my opinion that
a free-port will be the
only salvation of Zanzibar
and I should strongly
advocate any reasonable
surrender of treaty rights
as regards Custom House
charges, harbor or tonnage
dues, to bring it about.</p>

<p>The question of the
total prohibition of cheap
spirits imported for native
use is also being considered
and like the free-port
question is advocated by
the friends of the place
opposed by the Germans
and would necessitate a
change of treat. I am
<unclear/> strongly in favour
of absolutely prohibiting
the importation of low
proof spirits for native use</p>

<pb facs="160355"/>

<p>I also consider that
with a British Protectorate,
esterritorial rights have
ceased to be of value and
I think it would be for
the best interests of all
concerned, if nost of our
judicial powers were
transferred to the British
Court- In fact, as I
look at the situation here
I cannot see why the
English Government does
not make this a <unclear/>
<unclear/> and be done with
all these half-way
measures. Germany would
probably be the only power
to seriously object, and it
seems to me if the trans-
fer of the German Coast
had been used at its full
value England might
have had Zanzibar
without trouble.</p>

<pb facs="160359"/>

<p>In submitting my
views on these important
questions thus freely to
the Department, I trust
I have not exceded the
bounds of propriety.

Your obedient servant.
