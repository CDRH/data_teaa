<p>Introduction</p>

<p>On the 5 rolls of this microfilm publication are reproduced
11 volumes that contain mainly despatches, with enclosures, ad-
dressed to the Department of State by U.S. consular officials
at Zanzibar, Zanzibar, British Africa, between April 27, 1836,
and June 7, 1906.</p>

<p>The despatches, with few exceptions, are arranged in chron-
ological order. At the beginning of Roll 1 are reproduced se-
lected pages from 23 State Department registers of correspondence
that constitute a register of despatches from Zanzibar between
April 27, 1836, and June 7, 1906.</p>

<p>Interspersed throughout the series are such documents as
occasional memoranda prepared by other State Department offi-
cials and letters from private citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>The consular post at Zanzibar was established on March 11,
1836, and the appointment of Richard P. Waters as the first con-
sul was confirmed on the same day. During the period 1836-1906
several special agents from the Department of State were sent to
the consulate: Robert W. Shuffeldt, 1878; Frederic M. Cheney,
1886; and Augustus C. B. Govea, 1888. The post was closed tempo-
rarily between November 1894 and August 1895.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects to which the despatches relate are
shipwrecks, desertions, and mutinies and other disturbances on
U.S. vessels; the repression of the slave trade and the aboli-
tion of slavery, 1846-97; concessions granted on the East Afri-
can Coast to foreign governments; the establishment of the
British Protectorate, 1890; and the African expiditions of
John H. Speke and James A. Grant, 1862-63; Baron Karl K. von der
Decken, 1865; David Livingstone, 1866-73; and Henry M. Stanley,
1871-72 and 1874-89. Included also are photographs of Zanzibar
taken during a skirmish between the Sultan's forces and the
British forces, 1896, and issues of the Gazette for Zanzibar and
East Africa and the Bombay Government Gazette.</p>

<p>Many despatches are transmittal letters for enclosures of
a routine nature forwarded by consular officials to the Depart-
ment of State, such as reports on consular fees received and on
trade. In accordance with departmental policy adopted in 1870,
however, most statistical enclosures were removed from their
covering letters and distributed among other records of the De-
partment of State or sent to other departments of the Government.</p>

<p>The records reproduced in this microcopy are part of the
records in the National Archives designated as Record Group 59,
General Records of the Department of State.</p>

<pb facs="130913.jpg"/>

<p>National Archives Microfilm Publications</p>

<p>In the same record group are several series of volumes con-
taining additional documents on relations between posts in the
western aread of the Indian Ocean and the United States. There
are microcopies available on despatches from U.S. consular offi-
cials at Aden, Aden, 1880-1906 (T-503); Bombay, India, 1838-1906
(Microcopy 168); Lourenco Marques, Mozambique, Prtuguese Africa,
1854-1906 (T-171); Mahe, Seychelles Islands, Indian Ocean,
1868-88 (T-437); Muscat (Masqat), Oman, 1880-1906 (T-638), for 
1836-57 see Zanzibar (Rolls 1-3 of Microcopy 468); Port Louis,
Mauritius, Mascarene Islands, Indian Ocean, 1794-1805, 1817-1906
(Microcopy 462); St. Denis, Réunion Island, Mascarene Islands,
Indian Ocean, 1880-92 (Microcopy 463); and Tamatave, Madagascar,
1853-1906 (T-60). Complementary to the despatches are instruc-
tions to the consuls. Other related records are notes from the 
foreign mission of Zanzibar in the United States to the Depart-
ment of State, 1843-1905 (Roll 3 of T-953).</p>

<p>The method of arranging the consular and diplomatic series
cited above was discontinued in 1906 when the Department of
State adopted the practice of filing incoming and outgoing cor-
respondence, memoranda, and other documents by subject.</p>

<p>In the Department of State decimal file, 1910-29, also in
Record Group 59, are additional documents relating to Zanzibar.
Some documents are in the series relating to internal affairs of
British Africa (Roll 33 of Microcopy 583), and other documents
are in the series concerning political relations between British
Africa and other states (Microcopies 584 and 585).</p>

<p>In Record Group 84, Records of the Foreign Service Posts
of the Department of State, in the National Archives, are rec-
ords originally kept at U.S. diplomatic and consular posts.
Among them are records of the post at Zanzibar, 1834-1918, and
at other posts in the western area of the Indian Ocean. One vol-
ume of documents from Zanzibar is included in records of the 
post at Mombasa, Kenya, British Africa, 1901-26.</p>

<p>The records reproduced in this microcopy were prepared for
filming by Ralph E. Huss, who also wrote these introductory re-
marks and provided the other editorial material.</p>

To the <unclear/>

Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir.
I have the honor to acknowledge
dispatch no 43, dated May 6th
1886 from the Department of State
incosing a draft of a new treaty
and a "Full Power" from the Pres-
ident for me to conclude the
same.</p>

<p>I at <unclear/> placed myself in
communication with His High-
ness the Sultan of Zanzibar and
sent him a draft of the proposed
treaty.</p>

<p>His Higness expressed himself
as very <unclear/> gratified that the
United States Government was
willing to make a new treaty
to his advantage. The treaty was
immediately drawn up in the <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="131322.jpg"/>

<p>English and <unclear/> languages, and
on the third July it was signed
by myself and H. H. <unclear/> Sec-
retary, who was H. H. Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>The treaty was made in du-
plicatel one copy is inclosed
with this dispatch and the other
is in His Higness possession.</p>

<p>I have <unclear/> over <unclear/> the
English <unclear/> treaties and I
cannot see that thus in any ad-
vantages that they get that is not
<unclear/> us.</p>

<p>His Highness the Sultan did
not <unclear/> one question, but ordered
the treaty got ready.</p>

<p>I am greatly indebted to one
Kanji Ragpah, a native <unclear/>
new who is an intimate friend
of the Sultan, in getting the treaty
through so quickly.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to request the
Department of State to inform me
if any allowance will be made <unclear/>
for making the new treaty with the
Sultan of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>I consider that such work is
outside of the line of a Consul's duty
and it made a great deal of extra
work and trouble, as is always the
case in these Oriental countries.</p>

<p>The Treaty was to be got through
in a great hurry and it was only
from my being a very old friend of
the Sultan that it was finished
in so short a time.</p>

<p>The salary of this Consulate
is only $1000. for <unclear/> and I
consider that $500 would be a fiar
recompense for my outside work on this
new treaty.</p>

United States Consulate
Zanzibar Sept 8 1886
To the Hon
Third Assist. Secy of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to enclose
herewith a letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the
Department of State, a copy of 
which he has sent to this Consulate
and which I have translated
and also enclose herewith.</p>

<p>The sum and substance of
this communication is, a request
of our Government to sanction
a tax on his own subjects, which
I have assured His Highness will
be undoubtedly granted time.</p>

<p>The Germans and English as
a pretence for making trouble with
the Sultan, claim that he has no
right to levy any taxes or duties
or any produce rained in the Sultanate</p>

<pb facs="131837.jpg"/>

<p>Sultanate of Zanzibar other
tahn is specified in the new
treaties, or on his own subjects.
The Sultan claims that he has
a right to tax his own subjects
as he pleases and produce belong-
ing to them.</p>

<p>This is a matter which
does not in the <unclear/> concern
Americans or American interests
in any way and which I
assume that our Government
will not care for me to take any
part in troubles likely to arise
from this dispute.</p>

Verbatim.</p>

<p>In the name of God the <unclear/></p>

<p>To His Excellency the noble, the liberal
and learned minister of Foreign Affairs of
the United States of America, may God prolong
his life in unblemished glory!</p>

<p>We had the honor to inform you in a
telegram of the 6th of August that we directed
a letter to your Excellency, this is the letter.</p>

<p>We have the pleasure to inform your
Exellency, that the new treaties with England
and Germany and the new clauses of duplicate
concluded with your country entered in force
on the 19th of August 1886 corresponding to the
<unclear/> New Year and that the Custom
Hour is in our own hands.</p>

<p>I have to inform you that in the new
treaties are not mentioned fifty five articles
of produce of our grant and on which we al-
ways had 5% duty- this produce has nothing
to do with the imports and exports by Europeans
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="131924.jpg"/>

<p>it concerns only my own people, who
do not pay any other taxes, so we continue
to tax the fifty-five articles of produce as before
at 5%.</p>

<p>We send you the names of the fifty-
five articles of the named produce in a list
joined to the letter and ask you to consider
it and sanction it. Salaam!</p>

<p>This letter was composed on the 7th
of September corresponding to the 6th of Jul-Hay
1303 of the Hejira.

To the Hon.
Third Assist. Secy of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir!
I have the honor to in-
form you that the 14th inst.
a fleet of six German Men-
of-war under Admiral Knorr
arrived at this port, followed
on the 15th by two French,
and one English is now
lying in the harbor.</p>

<p>The object of this movement
has not yet been made pub-
lic but it is understood that
the Sultan has been compelled
to cede a large portion of his
Coast territory to Germany and
one seaport to England.</p>

<p>This, of course is the end
of Arab power on this Coast power.</p>

<pb facs="132125.jpg"/>

<p>In my opinion American
interests and all foreign in-
terests but Germany, will suffer
greatly bu these changes and
it is greatly to be regretted
that some Government would
not assist the Sultan's Gov-
ernment against this German
robbery.</p>

<p>Considering that the Sultan's
power to control the various
wild and lawless tribes which are
under his <unclear>surcrainty</unclear>, will be
materially weakened and that
our large American interests
are absolutely without protec-
tion in case of riot or bom-
bardment, and that as the
first treaty power with the
Sultan we should be in some
way represented in the impor-
tant changes and transfers sure
to take place- I recommend
that an American man-of-war
of good sire be sent to remain</p>

<pb facs="132131.jpg"/>

<p>here at Zanzibar until this
trouble is definitely settled.</p>

<p>I trust that the Govern-
ment will take immediate
action in this matter as it
is one which admits of no
delay.</p>

<p>As representation of the
two largest houses in Zanzibar
I feel very anxious about the
large amount of property be-
longing to me being exposed
to fire or any incidiary acts.
also the future of the American
trade seems very uncertain and
I fear will be much injured
by the precedence which this
affair will give Germany-</p>

To the Hon.
Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir-
I had the honor to address
you on the 15th August 86 from
Zanzibar asking an allowance
of $500 for making a treaty with
the Sultan. On the 28th Sep 86 you
replied that there was no authority
of law to make an allowance.</p>

<p>I had hoped as the claim was just
something would be allowed and I went
to considerable expense to get the treaty
through quickly which I could not
afford out od $1000. per <unclear/> salary.</p>

<p>The climate of Zanzibar is a very
<unclear/> one for white men and my
health has been impaired by a <unclear>widower</unclear>
there. I take the liberty to ask of the
Hon. Secretary that some consideration

Zanzibar. January 30th, 1887
To the Hon.
Third Assist Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to in-
form you that the German
operations on this Coast have
so far resulted in the acqui-
sition of a strip of mangrove
swamp and marsh land some
forty miles long, situated on the
Coast about two hundred miles
North of Zanzibar, also a Ger-
man protectorate is acknowledged
for <unclear>Witu</unclear>, and the lease of two
Custom Houses on the Coast to 
the German East African Tra-
ding Company- the Sultan's
authority is restricted to a strip
of Coast Land ten miles wide 
extending from Jungs Bay to
<unclear>Kaperniz</unclear>, and ten miles around
each of</p>

<pb facs="132501.jpg"/>

<p>each of his Bin Addah tourns,
but the terms of this agreement
are I suppose more familiar
to the Department than to me.</p>

<p>At the time of writing my
Despatch No 108. in which I
suggest that a man-of-war
be sent here on account of this
German incident- feeling against
white-men in town was very
bitter and there was every pros-
pect of trouble, but at present the
negotiations are progressing fa-
vorably and quietly and there
is now no necessity for a man-
of-war to call here, although
it always has a good effect, and
I should very much like to
see one of our gun-bouts in
the harbor for a month or two
just at present.</p>

<p>The workings of the new
tariff on articles imported in
to the Island of Zanzibar
from the mainland are not
wholly</p>

<pb facs="132507.jpg"/>

<p>wholly satisfactory- this is
especially applicable to Ivory,
the market price of which it
is very difficult to fit, and the
Sultan's Collector of Customs
at present is a most unsuitable
man for the place and who
uses his position unfairly to 
further his own business; he
also, by buying small lots at
high prices keeps the price of
Ivory far above what it should
be- as my commercial position
in Canzibar is principally to
buy Ivory this affects me directly.</p>

<p>As soon as the German
affair is settled, the Sultan
will be forced to remove this
Collector and observe the spirit
as well as the letter of the treaties.
I am personally in sympathy
with the Germans and English
in this movement although
I am aware that our Govern-
ment does not wish to interfere
in any way</p>

<pb facs="132514.jpg"/>

<p>in any way with the internal
affairs of the Sultan's Government
but I think that a joint pro-
test of the German, English and
American consuls against this
man's continuing in office will
benefit all natinalities without
unpleasant complications.</p>

<p>I have to report the death
of the Interpreter of this Consulate
Joharris bin Saif, on the 29th inst.
after a service of nearly forty years:
his place will probably be filled
by an appointer of Consul Pratt's
after he takes ove the office-

has been recalled. at the 
instance of <unclear/> Bismark.</p>

<p>In this connection the
resignatin of Sir John Krik
NBM Political Agent and
Consul General is significant:
since it should appear to be
in the direct line of British
non-inerference with the proj-
ect of the German government
for the colonization of the
East Coast of Africa.</p>

the Portuguese Government and

<p>this market has for some time
been over supplied with <unclear/>
English and Indian goods.

American Imports

The imports from the United
States may be said to consist
<unclear/> of <unclear/> Petroleum,
unbleached cotton and soap-
these being the staples handled
by the American <unclear/> engaged
in this trade. The former
of these by its phenomenal cheap-
ness has completely taken the
place of the <unclear/> , which
in former <unclear/> were used
exclusively for illuminating
purposes.</p>

<pb facs="133057.jpg"/>

<p>all petroleum is often sold in
this market as low as one dol-
lar and a quarter- United States
currency- which fact would
not commend it to the <unclear/>
consideration of experts in 
America. The yearly consump-
tion of East Africa- Zanzibar
being the <unclear/> point-
is upwards of 75,000 cases.</p>

<p>American Consuls have for
many years been the stand
and in this market but their
use has been much curtailed
within the past the years by
the <unclear/> of the Cotton
manufactured in India.</p>

<unclear/> James D. Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washinton DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have to request of
the Department instanction
in relation to the Article in
the New English and German
treaties, stipulating that
goods may be landed here
in bond, for a period not
exceding six months.</p>

<p>This question is li-
able to arise at any time
and I should be glad to
know just what rights
might</p>

<pb facs="133404.jpg"/>

<p>might be claimed by Am-
ericans under this article.</p>

<p>The clause in the
new treaties relating to the
duty of <unclear/>-five per cent
in <unclear/> liquors, is prac-
tically a dead-letter. From
the fact that France has
not assinted to the appli-
cation of the Provised tariff
of Zanzibar to the experts
of France <unclear/> this
country.</p>

<p>Nationally, the English
and German merchants ob-
jected to paying any high-
er duty in <unclear/> liquprs
than was being paid by
the French i.c. five per cent
and</p>

<pb facs="133409.jpg"/>

<p>and the new rate (257-)
consequently could not be
sustained.</p>

<p>The Sultan, doubtless
having in mind he fact
that this new rate was in-
tended in past, as a com-
pensation for a reduction
of the duty in certain art-
icles of Export- is not
inclined to allow the for-
eign merchants any priv-
ilages under the new
treaties.</p>

<p>It is well known that
the Sultan does not <unclear/>
with favor in the idea of
landing goods in bond
and he might possibly
object</p>

<pb facs="133414.jpg"/>

<p>object on the grounds men-
tioned above.</p>

<p>It is often a great
convenience- as well as a
saving of expense- to Am-
ericans engaged in business
here to land goods in
bond: since in that way
a vessel might proceed
direct to her destination
without stopping at an
intermediate port.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to ad-
dress the Department at this
time in relation to the claim
of Dr. B. F. <unclear/> against
Sultan Abdullah. King od
Johanna.</p>

<p>This claim is of long
standing and the Depart-
ment has long since been
made acquainted with par-
ticulars of the same.</p>

<p>Dr. <unclear/> now appears
again to the Government at
the United States. Through
the Department of State
for some relief from the
burden under which he
is laboring.</p>

<pb facs="133543.jpg"/>

<p>To my own knowledge he
(Dr. <unclear/>) is internally in-
solvent, and is consquently
so pressed by his <unclear/>
on all sides as to be <unclear/>
ly hampered in the pros-
ecution of his <unclear/></p>

<p>By his <unclear/> and
intelligent efforts he has
developed his sugar plan-
tation to such a state of
perfection as to make it
(<unclear/>) a most
desirable property.</p>

<p>But with its present debt
it is quite impossible for
him to work it to a profit</p>

<p>There is no doubt
that had the King of Johanna
not taken the contemptable
action he did to injure
his prospects he (Dr. Wilson)
would have been now in
a position to realize large
benefits from his impier-
ed Estate.</p>

<pb facs="133609.jpg"/>

<p>In September 1885 when
Commander J F Barninton
visited Johanna in the
"<unclear/>" he made inquiry
into the matter as far as
was possible but it was
very difficult to get any
one to go on board he
"<unclear/>" to testify against
the King. Knowing that at
the moment the vessel felt
they would be punished
for so doing</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson has when
opportunity offered obtain-
ed what evidence he could
bearing in his case: and
I am sending the same
herewith as per the sub-
joined list of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>When Caption Patten
was at Johanna in the
'Lancaster' in april of last
year he was inclined to
take some claim in the
matter</p>

<pb facs="133616.jpg"/>

<p>matter. But the admiral
of the French gun boat
"<unclear/>" in the harbor bear-
ing the Commandant of the
Mayatta with instan claim
from his Government to take
over the Protectorate of the
Island. put a new phase
in the affair and the
'Lancaster' returned in good
<unclear/>.</p>

<p>It would appear that
the King was cerced into
signing the treaty with the
French in account of the
presence of an American
man of war in port from
the fact that he afterwards
protested against receiving
the French resident who
was finally landed by
<unclear/> in april of this year.</p>

<p>I am informed that
the President has recently
been negotiating a new
treaty</p>

<pb facs="133632.jpg"/>

<p>treaty with the King. But I
have no idea what terms
have been made.</p>

<p>From all that I
have been able to learn
Dr. Wilson is a <unclear/>
by the King's interference
cannot be less than 300,000.</p>

<p>Besides which he has
been a sufferer from
defamation of character
and from attempts on
his life.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would
not be out of place for
me to say here that I
have yet to hear one word
of derogation of his char-
acter in business methods
-this among my acquain-
taince in in Mauritius Réunion
Madagascar and <unclear/>.</p>

<p>If this were not the case
I imagine that he would
long since have been
compelled</p>

<pb facs="133648.jpg"/>

<p>compelled to have retired
from the field.</p>

<p>Trusting that the
Department will give this
matter the attention to which
I believe it is <unclear/>.

<p>Dear Sir,
Regarding your claim against the King of Johanna
for indemnity for the loss you have suffered through his
interference with you labour supply during the past four
years, we can say that we are well aware of the serious
injury done to you and <unclear/> by the large reduction in
the quantity of sugar produce by Patsy Estate resulting
from that interference.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that had the Sultan not
compelled a large number of your labourers to leave your
employment with the object of crippling your operations,
you would see this time have been able to repay as the
important advances of funds we made to you through <unclear/>
<unclear/> for the purpose of working your Estate.
Your claim for an indemnity is therefor clearly just
and indisputable and we trust the United States Government
will inforce its payment as soon as possible.</p>

<p>With reference to the representations which we
learn have been made to your government by some evil
<unclear/> persons, reflecting on your moral character, we can
only say they are false and malicious. During the last
year we have been intimatley acquainted with you: we
have therefore had every opportunity of observing your
behavior both here and in Johanna, and we are bound to</p>

<p><unclear/>, Johanna
May, 1887</p>

<p>Dear Sir Wilson,
Having been requested to act as an effort in
estimating the damges you suffered through the acts of Sultan
Abdallah, and being personally acquainted with the affairs and
also with the <unclear/> conduct of Sultan Abdallah, towards you,
I hereby state my opinion in the matter.</p>

<p>I know very well that the Sultan threatened
your life by giving orders to his armed men to short you when
they would get a chance of doing so; as you did not give
them the opportunity, the plot failed, but it is nevertheless clear
that the detention in your house through threats of being shot at,
prevented you from attending to the work of you plantation, as well
as to any other business you may have had in hand. I have seen
also in your house several places where the boards had been cut
through by bullters fired in the night and evidently intended for
you. I know also of the <unclear/> and sinking of your
steam launch while at her anchorage, and of the stealing of anchors
and chains in your boat shed, all acts perpetrated by the Sultan's
men and by his orders.</p>

<p>Regarding your labour, it is very well known to me and
to every one in the island that in the year <unclear>1883</unclear> the Sultan took
away some hundred free men who were working for you, and
gave orders to the Johanna men to withdraw from your employment
any and all the places they had in it. His taking place which
you were in full <unclear/> interfered not only with that <unclear/>, but with
those that followed, as it prevented you from doing your planting and</p>

<pb facs="134026.jpg"/>

<p>and many other important works.</p>

<p>From the quantities of sugar you made during the
preceding years, that is from 1879 to 1882 included, it is evident
that during that period your crops were increasing by about
one hundred tons every year. In the year 1883, <unclear/> of the 
Sultan's interference, you made only half the quantities of sugar
of the preceding year, or three hundred tons less than you should
have made had you not been interfered with by the Sultan.</p>

<p>The following years, 1884 to 1886, show a slight increase
but not in a ratio with the first alluded to (1879-1882), and I should
say that in those three last years (1884-1886) your yearly loss was
as heavy as in 1883, or about three hundred tons yearly, making
a total loss for the four years 1880-1886 of twelve hundred tons
which, at the Mauritius market prices during these years would
be with, with interest, Ro 300,000.</p>

<p>The above I consider to be as near as possible your losses
from the Sultan's interference with your labour in 1880 and 1886, not
speaking of the aforementioned attempts at your life, to, and
the general inconvenience you were put to by such <unclear/>
acts.</p>

<p>Trusting that the US Government will give to your
case all the attention it deserves, and that you may some day
be compensated for your losses,
I remain, Dear Doctor
very sincerely yours

<p>Dear Sir
In reply to your
communication asking for any information
known to me concerning your late troubles
with the Sultan Abdallah and for which you are
claiming an indemnity, I can state that
your labour supply was almost entirely taken
away from you leaving scarcely sufficiant
people to gather in your crop, thus neglecting
all necessary work for Sultan can, such as
planting, working etc. Knowing as I do the
progress made in yields during the first ten years
cultivation of virgin land I can assert that
your losses must have been enormous.</p>

<p>From the bullet holes I have seen in your house
which were made by the Sultan's soldiers when
passing through your estate I consider your
life to have been in great danger. Indeed
I know that it was so threatened that you
had to exercise great caution when in moving
round your house and were entirely prevented
from attending to your <unclear/> work. No one
can entertain any doubt about your
losses under such circumstances and
I hope that your government will give you</p>

<p>Dear Sir
Having been compelled by force when
imprisoned at <unclear/> by Sultan Abdallah to
male a false statement concering you, I now
wish to declare and publish that that statement
was false, it was written by Sultan Abdallah for
his own purpose and I was forced to sign it under
penalty of death if I did not. The statement
that he made me sign was that you had given
me money to hire men to go and fight for
Prince Mohamed and that you would pay
ten dollars per head for slaves and fifty dollars
for free men an in case a slave died or was
killed you would pay fifty dollars to his master.</p>

<p>All this I now <unclear/> swear is false,
I wish have to to state also that I have often heard
Sultan Abdallah say that he intended to drive you
away from Johanna and take your plantation for
his own benefit and that of his son <unclear/>. I have
heard him <unclear/> this intention many times
previous to the outbreak of trouble between him
and his borther Price Mohamed. Since

<p>Dear Sir,
As you requested when I went to Johanna on behalf of
the Oriental Bank Corporation and the <unclear/> of <unclear/> to inspect
and report when the Sultan's sugar estate at Bauban: I thouroughly
inspected the estate "Patsy" belonging to Doctor Wilson. I found
"Patsy" estate very well managed indeed, the canes well cultivated,
and the plant of machinery in good order. I should judge that
Dr. Wilson will this coming season turn out about 400 tons of sugar,
and I see as reason why he should not go on increasing his
production yearly, say from 40 to 100 tons until he makes 800 to 900
tons per <unclear/>. Dr. Wilson has done a great deal of hard and
intelligent work at Patsy, and it is my opinion that had his labour
not been interfered with by the Sultan since 1882 (when he made
527 tons of sugar) that he would have been making the 800 to 900 tons
annually since /86.</p>

<p>Doctor Wilson's losses from the cause above alluded to, I
am sure cannot be less than one hundred thousand pounds planting, taking
into conisderation the heavy fall in prices of sugar since that time,
without, re re, besides the loss of a certain quantity of canes abandoned
and left in the ground, the latter taking from the <unclear/> the necessary
proportion for future cultivation of them.</p>

<p>The French Protectorate will I hope and trust work well
for future operations as there is an abundance of labour on the island,
and the men want to work, but as it appears were only detered
from doing so by the Sultan who evidently does not wish to see</p>

<pb facs="134437.jpg"/>

<p><unclear/> in his island, with the Protectorate he will not
be allowed to interfere.</p>

<p>I do not consider that there is any wish whatever in
making <unclear/> to Dr. Wilson for working his estate.

<p>I hereby certify that I was present when Dr. Wilson
made a settlement with Sultan Abdallah and heard
Sultan Abdallah insist upon Dr. WIlson's paying him
interest for goods that he had had from the Sultan
from the date they were <unclear/> until time of settlement,
had heard Dr. Wilson parted, but he had to give in to
the Sultan in order to come to some settlement with him.
It was well known that the Sultan had agreed to
supply Dr. Wilson with everything he required to make
a plantation without charging him anything until
his plantation was paying. This was offered him for
the services he rendered to Sultan Abdallah.

<pb facs="134527.jpg"/>

<p>Johanna, 26th April 1886</p>

<p>Dr. B.F. Wilson has made <unclear/> tons of sugar in 1887. At the
commencement of the 1882 crop he was deprived of labour by
Sultan Abdallah, so that he could not extende his plantation,
and it has been invariably the same every year since that time
(1882). so that instead of increasing his production of sugar
yearly as he might have done had he had the required labour,
it has fallen off, so that his last crop was only 227 tons;
whereas he might have made, if not interfered with, 900 tons of
sugar the last season: the estate being able to produce about
1500 tons of sugar, if all is put under cultivation.</p>

<p>It is a very easy matter for a crop to be largely reduced by
want of labour during one season; but is very difficult, and
requires much time to increase it again. It will take Dr. Wilson
at least four years to get his production of sugar what it
would have been had he not been interfered with.</p>

<p>I have had much experience on sugar plantations, being an
agricultural chemist, and I consider myself well able to judge
in this case, having spent the last twelve years in sugar
colonies.</p>

<p>Another important consideration in connection with Dr. Wilson's
losses is the fall in the price of sugars for the last two years,
which has been more than 30%; as even if Dr. Wilson can
produce the same quantity of sugar as he had been able to
produce before, he could not get the same profit.

<p>Johanna 25th April 1886</p>

<p>In days age when the USS Lancaster was here Captin
<unclear/> received from Sultan Abdallah a letter containing
I have been told so, false statements against Dr. Wilson,
and placing him under a very dalse position; this letter,
bearing the signature of Prince Mohamed. <unclear/> Dr. Wilson
knew this he made some inquiries and learned, positively,
that Prince Mohamed never wrote the letter refered to, nor
any other letter to Captain Potter, but that this letter was
written by a fellow SS Abdallah, by his orders, and falsely
signed Mohamed. Having got this information, Dr. Wilson
asked Captain Potter to send an officer with the letter to
Prince Mohamed to ascertain the fact. The Lancaster being
ready to sail and under steam, no officer could go
shore, and Captain Potter refered Dr. Wilson to the
Commandant of Mayotte who was on shore making
a treaty with S. Abdallah.</p>

<p>I was present when Dr. Wilson asked the Commandant
of Mayotte to call Prince Mohamed and make an
inquiry on this letter falsely signed by him. Commandant
of Mayotte declined to make any inquiry.
Signed L. Ehrmann</p>

<p>I hereby certify that the foregoing
is a correct copy of the original
