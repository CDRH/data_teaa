<p>Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar April 4 1890</p>

<p>Honorable William F Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to ac-
knowledge receipt of your
despatches numbers 64 and 65.
dated respectively the 1st and
14th February 1890 which
have my attention.</p>

<p>With reference to your
despatch number 62 of the
10th January- I would
say that Dr B F Wilson
strongly object to the des-
ignation of the Governor of
Mayotte as arbitrator in
his claim against the King
of Johanna. I may say
in <unclear/> that I can <unclear/>
with Dr Wilson in his decision
in that the Governor of Mayotte
has</p>

<pb facs="152530"/>

<p>has an indirect interest in
the outcome of the case.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar June 23 1890</p>

<p>Honorable William F Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to ad-
dress the Department at this
time in relation to affairs
on the Braua Coast.
On the 7th instant I cabled
as follows vis:
Sate Department
Washington.
Braua Coast unsettled
American interests jeopar-
dized       Pratt</p>

<p>By letters received on
that date we learned of an
uprising of the natives at
Muka and that they had
looted the town- securing
some 150 <unclear/> the american
house of Ropes <unclear/>
and</p>

<pb facs="152924"/>

<p>and upwards of 5000
from British <unclear/> merchants.</p>

<p>Missus Ropes <unclear/>
who have large interests
at stake in that vicinity
immediately consulted with
me and it was at their
earnest salicitation that
I cabled the Department.
It being understood
that my cablegram would
supplement my statement
made to the Department by
representatives of REIC
who would visit Washing-
ton for that purpose.</p>

<p>The primary cause of
the disturbance is the con-
cession of the Coast to the
Imperial British East
Africa Company and through
them to the Italians.
Having</p>

<pb facs="152928"/>

<p>Having spent some
months on the Braua Coast
and having acquainted
myself with the <unclear/> and
disposition of the <unclear/>
of that country. I am cer-
tain that nay move in
the direction of European
interference will result in
complete demoralization.</p>

<p>The Italians disclaim
any present intention of
placing Europeans in that
district, and propose to
administer affairs from
Zanzibar.</p>

<p>During a recent
interview with the Sultan
I expressed the hope that
he would discourage the
visits of Foreign ships of
<unclear/> to that coast and
suggested that His Maj-
esty send me of his own
ships with a commissioner
empowered</p>

<pb facs="152934"/>

<p>empowered to <unclear/> with
the <unclear/>. His Majesty
<unclear/> to do so but 
<unclear/> that such a <unclear/>
will be <unclear/> for
some <unclear/> <unclear/> to the
difficulty in making a
landing at this season.</p>

<p>By the granting of
the concession to the Imperial
British East African Company
the estate states of affairs
has been altered. Yet
I trust that the Department
may <unclear/> its way clear
to call a halt in the <unclear/>
-tion of European occupation
of this coast since <unclear/>-
<unclear/> the americans engaged
in that trade will suffer
a great loss and perhaps
be compelled to retire
altogether from this <unclear/>-
<unclear/> profitable field of
operations.</p>

<pb facs="152938"/>

of the Department before

<p>To the Honorable
W F Wharton
Assist Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir
On investigating the
present commercial and
political situation here
I find that American
Interests are likely to be
affected by the following,
No. 1. The English Protec-
torate is soon to be
proclaimed and enforced,
Now will this affect the
American judicial and
extra-territorial rights,
treaties, exequatur, direct
communication with the
Sultan, etc?</p>

<p>No. 2. The Sultan and
Germany are treating for
the <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="153300"/>

<p>the cession to Germany
for a lump sum of the
African Coast at present
leased to the German
East African Company.
If this coast becomes a
separate state, will free
trade be allowed with 
Zanzibar? About two
thirds of the present
American trade is conduct
-ed indirectly with and
through the above district,
if any additional tariff
is put on trade between
the island of Zanzibar
and the mainland, our
merchants must establish
new agencies in the
German territory and give
up their extensive houses
in Zanzibar, or retire from
trade entirely. For obvious
reasons such a course as the former
would be extremely
expensive</p>

<pb facs="153305"/>

<p>expensive and <unclear/>
and in <unclear/> of <unclear/>
experience on the <unclear/>
Coast will not be affected.
American Interests <unclear/>
that but one duty shall
be levied between exports
and imports to and from
the island of Zanzibar
and the mainlands.</p>

<p>No. 3. The <unclear/> Coast of
Zanzibar has been leased
to the British East African
Company who have not
<unclear/> it but are now
talking of transfering it
to an Italian Company.
The American homes of
Roper, <unclear/> have
a large trade and much
property there, but believing
that no Europeans can
successfully administer
this Coast government
they have decided to
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="153311"/>

<p>withdraw, temporarily
at mayotte.</p>

<p>I respectfully request
such instructions and
information regarding
the foregoing as the
Department may see
fit to forward and
particularly relating
to No. 1.</p>

<p>There are no other
matters of importance
in this Consulat district
of which the Department
has not been previously
advised.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar, January 11 1891</p>

<p>Honorable W F Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honour to
forward herewith copies of a
correspondence relating to an
additional duty levied on
imports to the German East
African Coast of Zanzibar,
and to address the Department
briefly regarding the <unclear/></p>

<p>The Dominion of the
Sultan of Zanzibar formerly
comprised the whole of the
East Central African Coast
and adjacent islands until
this year, when the Sultan
was induced by Germany
and England</p>

<pb facs="155735"/>

<p>and England to sell
to the former his sovereign
rights in about 400 miles
of this Coast, (transfered <unclear/>)<!--this is a date-->
leaving for himself the
islands of Zanzibar and
Bonba and a small piece
of Coast to the North, all
under a British Protectorate.</p>

<p>By the treaties with
Zanzibar, it is specially
provided that goods which
have paid 5% duty once
shall pass free through
any ports of Zanzibar
territory, and it has been
customary to import to
the island of Zanzibar
all goods intended for
East African trade and
paying duty there, <unclear/>
to the various Coast ports,
the island acting merely
as a distributing center
and not as a <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="155740"/>

<p>On December 22nd last,
notice was received from
the German Consulate,
<unclear/>, from Jany 10 1891,
"the duty" would be taken
on the German Coast
for account of the German
Government, meaning that
5% duty would be levied
on all goods imported to 
the German Coast, whether
they had previously paid
to the Zanzibar Customs 
or not- This duty is
now in force there.</p>

<p>The Americans have
of <unclear/> Roper, <unclear/>
hold in this city a lot of
goods destined expressly
for the German Coast, on
which they have paid 5%
duty to the Zanzibar Customs,
and on their <unclear/>
this fact to me and also
the impossibility of making
shipping</p>

<pb facs="155746"/>

<p>shipping and storage
arrangements in the
space of eight days. I
filed a protest against
this duty being levied
with the German Consul,
as per copy inclosed.</p>

<p>At the same time
I addressed H H the Sultan
through the British Agency,
protesting against another
duty being allowed to be
charged on goods already
passed at Zanzibar, and
claimed a free market,
or a drawback onall
American duty-paid goods
here for export to said Coast.
In reply, the British Agent
states that he is in a
similar situation in regard
to British subjects and is
unable to make any state-
ment until he is advised
by his Government, to
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="155750"/>

<pb facs="155757"/>

<p>I am of the opinion
that, as the Sultan only
could sell something that
he possessed and he never
possessed the right to levy
a second duty of 5% on
goods duty-paid in Zan-
sibar, the Germans have
no legal rights to levy
such duty, and the 
Sultan is responsible for
allowing this state of things
(of course it being under-
stood that the Sultan
is but a name, England
being the responsible party)
As contracting party to
the treaties the Sultan
has agreed that one duty
of 5% passes all goods free
through all ports of his
dominions, and I believe
him to be responsible for
any <unclear/> caused by a
transfer of any port of
his dominions</p>

<pb facs="155801"/>

<p>without any notice what-
ever to the Treaty Powers.</p>

<p>The amount claimed
by <unclear/> Roper, <unclear/>
is 5% drawback on $<unclear/>
<unclear/> of duty-paid goods
specially imported for-
sale on the German Coast
and held by them in the
city of Zanzibar on the
1st of January <unclear/> say
$<unclear/>, and are submitting
this claim to the Depart-
ment I consider that we
have a clear case against
the Sultan through the
English Protectorate, and
trust the the Department
will indorce my opinion
and take proceedings
towards payment of the claim.

Pangam, Saadam, Bagamoyo,

<p>Sir:
Understanding that you
have taken charge of the
Foreign Relations of HH the Sultan,
I have the honour to request that
you bring to the notice of His
Highness' Government the following,</p>

<p>The American house of
Roper, <unclear/> hold in this
city, a quantity of goods on which
they have paid 5% duty to the
Zanzibar Customs. Under
existing treaties, one payment
of 5% admits goods free to all
ports and parts of the Sultan's
Dominions, and in good faith
under this treaty right, these
goods were imported from the
United States</p>

Zanzibar</p>

<pb facs="155900"/>

<p>United States, especially for trade
in that portion of His Higness'
Dominions leased to the German
East African Company.</p>

<p>On the 22nd inst, I received
notice from the German Consulate
that from January 1st 1891, duty
would be taken on the German
East African coast for account
of the German government, from
which I infer that some transfer
in the Coast Government has
been made although no notice
of any such transfer has been
received from anyone, at this
Consulate.</p>

<p>If this additional duty
is allowed to be levied on the
Coast at nine days notice, I am
of the opinion that a drawback
of 5% should be allowed by
HH the Sultan to <unclear/>
on all duty-paid goods held
by them</p>

<pb facs="155914"/>

<p>by them now in Zanzibar
and which can only find a
market on the German Coast,
or that some arrangement should
be made between HH the Sultan
and the German authorities, by
which these goods may be
imported free into the German
Coast within a reasonable time,
say six months.</p>

<p>I presume that, in the
future <unclear/> for the
German Coast via Zanzibar
may be transhipped in bond,
if, in the meantime, no more
favorable arrangement is made.</p>

I have the honour to

letter dated the 29th inst. on the
subject of an intimation which
upon have received that after the

Zanzibar destined for import into
the German Coast Line and
which have already paid duty
to the</p>

You require whether or not such

To the Department of State</p>

<p>Subject:
Trade and Political Affairs</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.
Effect of additional Coast duty.
Transhipmens in bond.
Zanzibar a free-port considered.
Total prohibition of importation

Transfer of judicial powers to

Remarks on Zanzibar being made
a British Colony.

<pb facs="160338"/>

<p>British Government
propose to take regarding
the numerous protests
and claims arising from 
this arbitrary Coast duty,
and nothing has occurred
to shake me in my opinion
that the Sultan is
responisble for a 5% drraw-
back on all duty-paid
goods held by American
merchants on January 1st 91
for German Coast trade.</p>

<p>The question of
making Zanzibar a free
port has been agitated
for some time and meets
with the approval of all
friends of Zanzibar and
as nearly everything is
now passed in bond, the
law to the Sultan would
be only the <unclear/> on
imports consumed in
the islands of Zanzibar
and <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="160347"/>

<p>and <unclear/> and <unclear/>
islands, which <unclear/>
I do not estimate at more
than coast of collecting.
It would therefore appear
that there is no obstacle
in making this a free
port, but the treaties pro-
vide that the Sultan
must provide suitable
Custom House and go-downs
and transhipment stores,
free of all storage charges
other than the 5% duty
take away this duty and 
we have the Sultan rem-
oving a Custom House for
nothing- Of course he
objects- It will therefore
be necessary to alter the
treaties to make this a
free port and any such
alterations would probably
be opposed by Germany
as against the interests
of the</p>

<pb facs="160350"/>

<p>Coast Colony opposite
as it doubtless would be.
it is my opinion that
a free-port will be the
only salvation of Zanzibar
and I should strongly
advocate any reasonable
surrender of treaty rights
as regards Custom House
charges, harbor or tonnage
dues, to bring it about.</p>

<p>The question of the
total prohibition of cheap
spirits imported for native
use is also being considered
and like the free-port
question is advocated by
the friends of the place
opposed by the Germans
and would necessitate a
change of treat. I am
<unclear/> strongly in favour
of absolutely prohibiting
the importation of low
proof spirits for native use</p>

<pb facs="160355"/>

<p>I also consider that
with a British Protectorate,
esterritorial rights have
ceased to be of value and
I think it would be for
the best interests of all
concerned, if nost of our
judicial powers were
transferred to the British
Court- In fact, as I
look at the situation here
I cannot see why the
English Government does
not make this a <unclear/>
<unclear/> and be done with
all these half-way
measures. Germany would
probably be the only power
to seriously object, and it
seems to me if the trans-
fer of the German Coast
had been used at its full
value England might
have had Zanzibar
without trouble.</p>

<p>In submitting my
views on these important
questions thus freely to
the Department, I trust
I have not exceded the
bounds of propriety.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant.

I have the honour to inform you

from Her Majesty's Government, I have
caused to be closed several shops,
belonging to Goanese subjects of
Portugal, in which an unlicensed
sale of liquor was being carried on
in defiance of the regulations issued
by the Protecting Power with a view
to fulfilling its obligations incurred
under Article xcl of the Brussels Act.
The owners of these shops had been
several times warned of the con-
