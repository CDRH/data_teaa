<p>Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar March 2nd 1891</p>

<p>Mr Ropes
To the Department of State</p>

<p>Subject:
Trade and Political Affairs</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.
Effect of additional Coast duty.
Transhipmens in bond.
Zanzibar a free-port considered.
Total prohibition of importation
of cheap spirits aducated.
Transfer of judicial powers to
British coast.
Remarks on Zanzibar being made
a British Colony.
(This is <unclear/>)</p>

<pb facs="160338"/>

<p>British Government
propose to take regarding
the numerous protests
and claims arising from 
this arbitrary Coast duty,
and nothing has occurred
to shake me in my opinion
that the Sultan is
responisble for a 5% drraw-
back on all duty-paid
goods held by American
merchants on January 1st 91
for German Coast trade.</p>

<p>The question of
making Zanzibar a free
port has been agitated
for some time and meets
with the approval of all
friends of Zanzibar and
as nearly everything is
now passed in bond, the
law to the Sultan would
be only the <unclear/> on
imports consumed in
the islands of Zanzibar
and <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="160347"/>

<p>and <unclear/> and <unclear/>
islands, which <unclear/>
I do not estimate at more
than coast of collecting.
It would therefore appear
that there is no obstacle
in making this a free
port, but the treaties pro-
vide that the Sultan
must provide suitable
Custom House and go-downs
and transhipment stores,
free of all storage charges
other than the 5% duty
take away this duty and 
we have the Sultan rem-
oving a Custom House for
nothing- Of course he
objects- It will therefore
be necessary to alter the
treaties to make this a
free port and any such
alterations would probably
be opposed by Germany
as against the interests
of the</p>

<pb facs="160350"/>

<p>Coast Colony opposite
as it doubtless would be.
it is my opinion that
a free-port will be the
only salvation of Zanzibar
and I should strongly
advocate any reasonable
surrender of treaty rights
as regards Custom House
charges, harbor or tonnage
dues, to bring it about.</p>

<p>The question of the
total prohibition of cheap
spirits imported for native
use is also being considered
and like the free-port
question is advocated by
the friends of the place
opposed by the Germans
and would necessitate a
change of treat. I am
<unclear/> strongly in favour
of absolutely prohibiting
the importation of low
proof spirits for native use</p>

<pb facs="160355"/>

<p>I also consider that
with a British Protectorate,
esterritorial rights have
ceased to be of value and
I think it would be for
the best interests of all
concerned, if nost of our
judicial powers were
transferred to the British
Court- In fact, as I
look at the situation here
I cannot see why the
English Government does
not make this a <unclear/>
<unclear/> and be done with
all these half-way
measures. Germany would
probably be the only power
to seriously object, and it
seems to me if the trans-
fer of the German Coast
had been used at its full
value England might
have had Zanzibar
without trouble.</p>

<pb facs="160359"/>

<p>In submitting my
views on these important
questions thus freely to
the Department, I trust
I have not exceded the
bounds of propriety.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant.

<p>Sir,
I have the honour to inform you
that, acting under instructions received
from Her Majesty's Government, I have
caused to be closed several shops,
belonging to Goanese subjects of
Portugal, in which an unlicensed
sale of liquor was being carried on
in defiance of the regulations issued
by the Protecting Power with a view
to fulfilling its obligations incurred
under Article xcl of the Brussels Act.
The owners of these shops had been
several times warned of the con-
sequences of offering defiance to
the Brussels Act and had been
advised</p>
