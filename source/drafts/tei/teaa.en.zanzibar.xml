<p>Patsy Estate
Johanna 25 June 1889</p>

<p>Seth A Pratt <unclear/>
US Consul
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
I last wrote to you on the 19th inst
and sent letters by the American Whaler
"<unclear/>" and no doubt you have on this
received them. I however enclose <unclear/> copies
of the same herewith. I wrote to you that
three Johannamen were on their way to you
to give their testimony and to be away from the
vengeance of the Sultan. One of my men <unclear/>
has got as far as <unclear/> but the other two
Aloe Shi and Halliday Shi were arrested as they
were on the point of embarking in a <unclear/>
on bord of <unclear/>, vessel, they were imprisoned
for the night and in the morning taken before the
Sultan who abused and threatened them all he
knew how and will not permit any <unclear/>
leave in the night for fear they may get on boat
and get away and give evidence against him
these two men have <unclear/> written statements what
I have had "englishigen" and at their request here
with enclose to you. It simply shows what</p>

<pb facs="150144"/>

<p>what means and devices this old tyrant
will use to further his own ends. The French
handle him pretty roughly at times but when
he demands pardon their all <unclear/> and they
are as thick and happy as bees together <unclear/>
I am anxious to know how the
arbitrating business in my case is to be <unclear/></p>

<p>If the Resident and French Government
call their 'enquete' <unclear/>proper investigation I
do not and under every point I have
demanded is given into I certainly protests
against it. Here the Resident calls every
one he chooses and asks any question he chooses
without my reviewing nay thing about it
on an opportunity of reputing any false
statements: butso far as I can learn
they cannot bring one such thing against
one although they trouble the affairs of
supplies to his brother which I think they
have given to that they have not a leg to stand
on there. They might as well accuse you as me.
But over there, that was not the government
of my grievances and the serious ones <unclear/>. His
brother only rebelled in 1884 and my brother <unclear/>
1882. If all works welle here I intend going
home on this business and I am glad we
have the Hon: <unclear/> to the which <unclear/>
of the Hon. <unclear/>. I cannot imagine</p>

<pb facs="150151"/>

<p>the Hon. <unclear/> <unclear/> such
a treaty as the French have here. <unclear/>
they are not <unclear/> for anything and
as <unclear/> claim hold the Salim <unclear/>.
I have been writing to the Resident about
the salve trade treaty here with the English and
requested a reply to my letter but he would
not write but came not to see me. He did not
recognize the English treaty at all. He <unclear/> they
have made a treaty since <unclear/> holds the slave
five years <unclear/>. Of course the English
COnsul at Zanzibar will know about this
and I wish you would call upon this matter.
According to the English treaty all slaves are
to be absolutely free in August next, French
say free yes but they must work for their
masters five years more once they engage
for another five years!! I think "<unclear/>"
will grow under that business. Anyone
can buy a slaves labour now for 150 <unclear/> for
five years if he wishes. I would like to
know the English opinion of it. Of course
slaves are bought and sold here daily and have been
here since the English treaty and their a which
French have "the ball". They say the English have
not <unclear/> in talk any notes of the treaty.
Hoping to hear from you soon and patiently
I am your obedient servant
B F Wilson</p>

<p>Patsy Estate
Johanna 29 July 1889</p>

<p>Seth A Pratt <unclear/>
US Consul
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Sir:
Your two valuable favors of the
date 31st May and 2nd July duly to hand
by this months courrier. The USS <unclear/>
was too late to be of any service as regards the
enquiry and I do not know but it is all
for the best that there was no <unclear/> here or
no representant of my government. I never
feared any thing but false statements and
lies and my truly reason for mounting a
<unclear/> myself on a US government office
that could prove that but as they have had
all their own many they cannot <unclear/>
find any fault. The only thing I
fear now is that the US government will
be too <unclear/> and not push any claim.</p>

<p>I received a letter rom Baron <unclear/> by
the last mail. (a <unclear/>) He says that
my government have not proved my claim
and they will have to if I am <unclear/>.
Do you think I should go home for
that purpose? It is now <unclear/> <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="150207"/>

<p>and I would not like to leave here unless
necessary. Still I could do so. I could
only <unclear/> some facts and important ones
which perhaps have not been written but if
the US Government observe well all that has
been sent to the Department of State since 1884
they will have my <unclear/> pretty well. I know
the French Government will wish to get out of
it by saying the King cannot pay. He has nothing
they say. He could have paid and would
have paid if the French had kept out of these
islands. I consider now that they are
responsible for the Sultan and I have good
French Authority also for saying this. His
section is <unclear/> and they are responsible.</p>

<p>I am astonished that the US Government
and the English Government also did not
object from the <unclear/> to me on two articles
in their treaty of the Protectorate. Perhaps they
have. Certainly Mr. Blains will bring
them to this hearing.</p>

<p>You no doubt have had the "<unclear/>" with
you on this. It does my heart good
to see an American man of war: they
are altogether <unclear/>.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear good news
from you and the Department of State
I am Your obedient servant
B F Wilson</p>

<p>Translation of letter of Aloe Shi <unclear/></p>

<p>I Aloe Shi Dreyman do hereby swear by the <unclear>Koran</unclear> that
I went to French Resident of Johanna these
days in succession and <unclear/> three different
times to give my testimony while he was making the
enquiry. I want to tell what I know that Sultan
Abdallah had done to Dr. Wilson and these times
I was acomanied by Halliday Shi. On the third
day the Resident told us he would not take our statements
at all. <unclear/> the same time he was taking the
statements of men who Sultan Abdallah sent. We
came to the conclusion (Halliday and myself) that we
would go to Zanzibar and make our statements there
and intended to letter passage in the vessel of <unclear/>
<unclear/> ("<unclear/>") but were taken and imprisoned
by the Police of the Sultan and kept in prison until morning
when we were taken before the Sultan. <unclear/> said to 
us "you wish to run away and go to sea". The reason
that we wished to go to Zanzibar was that the Sultan
sent to me one Said Omar and told me that
I must go before the Resident and swear that
the <unclear/> agreed to give me three thousand dollars
if I would be witness for him. I informed this
<unclear/> that I could not tell such a lie about the
<unclear/> but he <unclear/> should go and tell this to the Resident <unclear/>
will give him one hundred dollars, <unclear/>
<unclear/> Sultan called me to the <unclear/>
<unclear/> I was an <unclear/> <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="150259"/>

<p>one hundred and twenty six dollars and of the
American government does not liking will this
Sultan will kill us. He likes me also that he would not
allow me to go to Patsy to Dr Wilson, and I want the
US Consul to know all of this.

<unclear/> the <unclear/> that all that I have <unclear/> is <unclear/>.
I went to the Residentof <unclear/> in Johanna at three
different times to tell what I know about the Sultan
Abdallah and Dr. Wilson. I went to the Resident
accompanied by Aloe Shi and on the third
day he told me and Aloe Shi that he would not take
<unclear/> more evidence at all but when Sultan
Abdallah men came to him he took their evidence.</p>

<p>Aloe Shi and myself wished to go to Zanzibar
to give our evidence there and attempted to
go aboard of the American ship <unclear/>
and the Sultan sent his police and arrested
us and put us in prison until morning and
said to us that we wanted to run away and
take Abdallah called me to his house and <unclear/>
<unclear/> and for the reason that I wished to be a witness
for Dr Wilson. He called me in his <unclear/> an <unclear/>
and all of this is <unclear/>. If we do not get relief
from this man we will die. And all of his people
say that if he the Sultan gets the best of <unclear/> in

had given evidence against him. You must

<p>Sir
I have the honor to enclose
herein a copy (in arabic) of
the original treaty entered
into April 22 1886 between
the King of Johanna and the
commandant of Mayotte ac-
ting for the President of the
French Republic.</p>

were on the Wilson Estate.</p>

<p>With regard to the
case of Dr Wilson His
affairs and now in a most
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="151321"/>

<p>critical condition, and unless
some relief is afforded him
without delay, he will of
necessity be compelled to
abandon his estate and
thus see the labor of years
brought to naught.</p>

<p>His principal undebted-
ness is to <unclear/> in
Mauritius: and it must
be borne in mind that this
debt has all been contract-
ed since the year 1880. owing
to the obstruction of his
business by the King.</p>

<p>A small amount (Ro 25000)
is due to a British subject
at Zanzibar whi is about
taking legal steps to <unclear/>
the same through this
consulate.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to be in-
formed by the Department
as to what action should be
taken by this Consulate in
the matter.</p>

<pb facs="151327"/>

<p>in the matter.</p>

<p>An attachment on the
estate of Dr Wilson would
virtually <unclear/> up his af-
fairs since the Mauritius
conditins would stop all
advances for the working
of the property and would
levy for the <unclear/> of

Monsieur le Docteur <unclear/>
Resident du <unclear/>
<unclear/></p>

<p>Sir
Upong this estate we are suffering for the <unclear/>
of labour to carry on the work, and this I am sorry
to say is carried by ill treatment of them who so work
for me by the Sultan.</p>

<p>You are well aware that His Highness the Sultan made
a written engagement with me to supply me with all
of the labour I reguired before I <unclear/> to remain
upon this island. This engagement he has never
kept with me. On the contrary since 1882 he has
he has constantly tried to deprive me of labour and
ruin my prospects. When the USS "<unclear/>" was
here in September 1883- making an enquiry with my
complaints the Sultan faithfully promised Commander
Harrington that he would <unclear/> from disturbing my
labour, and allow any and all people to work for
me without hinderance. He also made the same
promise to Captain Potter of the USS Lancaster in
April 1886 but the Sultan has not kept his word and
faith with one of these affairs, and my labour
has constantly been interfered with, and these <unclear/>
people who dare to work for me are so taxed that
they can have no object in working . <unclear/>
not working for me</p>

<pb facs="151446"/>

<p>not working for me are only reasonably <unclear/>
and one half such. There are many here who <unclear/>
here <unclear/> but are permitted for the <unclear/>
and <unclear/> the Sultan does not <unclear/>
to work for me. For this reason, <unclear/> <unclear/>
of the <unclear/> have the island <unclear/> supply
much of <unclear/>, <unclear/> <unclear/> Mayotte</p>

<p>I have on this occasion <unclear/> this with
<unclear/> of your predecession (Resident) but no <unclear/>
has no been taken of my complaints. I am
now asking of you if you <unclear/> <unclear/>
my behalf, and if the people who wish I were
and beg to request that they pay no more taxes than
others and that the over paid to you be <unclear/>
to them. These free people decline to work now for
the only reason that they will be made to pay five
dollars instead of one and one half dollars. Some
who have worked here and had <unclear/> the many
demanded of them have had their <unclear/> from
them. The Sultan has said that all work
for me must pay five dollars and this is only
deprive me of my labour and ruin me <unclear/>.</p>

<p>I am sending this by <unclear/> of my <unclear/>
who can affirm to what I say and if further people
is necessary I will send all of the men but beg that
you will guarantee that they will not be <unclear/> by
His Highness for giving evidence against him.</p>

<p>Trusting that you will give this <unclear/> attention
I am Your obedient servant

<p>Honorable William F Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to ad-
dress the Department at this
time in relation to affairs
on the Braua Coast.
On the 7th instant I cabled
as follows vis:
Sate Department
Washington.
Braua Coast unsettled
American interests jeopar-
dized       Pratt</p>

<p>By letters received on
that date we learned of an
uprising of the natives at
Muka and that they had
looted the town- securing
some 150 <unclear/> the american
house of Ropes <unclear/>
and</p>

<pb facs="152924"/>

<p>and upwards of 5000
from British <unclear/> merchants.</p>

<p>Missus Ropes <unclear/>
who have large interests
at stake in that vicinity
immediately consulted with
me and it was at their
earnest salicitation that
I cabled the Department.
It being understood
that my cablegram would
supplement my statement
made to the Department by
representatives of REIC
who would visit Washing-
ton for that purpose.</p>

<p>The primary cause of
the disturbance is the con-
cession of the Coast to the
Imperial British East
Africa Company and through
them to the Italians.
Having</p>

<p>Having spent some
months on the Braua Coast
and having acquainted
myself with the <unclear/> and
disposition of the <unclear/>
of that country. I am cer-
tain that nay move in
the direction of European
interference will result in
complete demoralization.</p>

<p>The Italians disclaim
any present intention of
placing Europeans in that
district, and propose to
administer affairs from
Zanzibar.</p>

<p>During a recent
interview with the Sultan
I expressed the hope that
he would discourage the
visits of Foreign ships of
<unclear/> to that coast and
suggested that His Maj-
esty send me of his own
ships with a commissioner
empowered</p>

difficulty in making a
landing at this season.</p>

<p>By the granting of
the concession to the Imperial
British East African Company
the estate states of affairs
has been altered. Yet
I trust that the Department
may <unclear/> its way clear
to call a halt in the <unclear/>
-tion of European occupation
of this coast since <unclear/>-
<unclear/> the americans engaged
in that trade will suffer
a great loss and perhaps
be compelled to retire
altogether from this <unclear/>-

operations.</p>

<p>To the Honorable

<p>Sir
On investigating the
present commercial and
political situation here
I find that American
Interests are likely to be
affected by the following,
No. 1. The English Protec-
torate is soon to be
proclaimed and enforced,
Now will this affect the
American judicial and
extra-territorial rights,
treaties, exequatur, direct
communication with the
Sultan, etc?</p>

<p>No. 2. The Sultan and
Germany are treating for
the <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="153300"/>

<p>the cession to Germany
for a lump sum of the
African Coast at present
leased to the German
East African Company.
If this coast becomes a
separate state, will free
trade be allowed with 
Zanzibar? About two
thirds of the present
American trade is conduct
-ed indirectly with and
through the above district,
if any additional tariff
is put on trade between
the island of Zanzibar
and the mainland, our
merchants must establish
new agencies in the
German territory and give
up their extensive houses
in Zanzibar, or retire from
trade entirely. For obvious
reasons such a course as the former
would be extremely
expensive</p>

<pb facs="153305"/>

<p>expensive and <unclear/>
and in <unclear/> of <unclear/>
experience on the <unclear/>
Coast will not be affected.
American Interests <unclear/>
that but one duty shall
be levied between exports
and imports to and from
the island of Zanzibar
and the mainlands.</p>

<p>No. 3. The <unclear/> Coast of
Zanzibar has been leased
to the British East African
Company who have not
<unclear/> it but are now
talking of transfering it
to an Italian Company.
The American homes of
Roper, <unclear/> have
a large trade and much
property there, but believing
that no Europeans can
successfully administer
this Coast government
they have decided to
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="153311"/>

<p>withdraw, temporarily
at mayotte.</p>

<p>I respectfully request
such instructions and
information regarding
the foregoing as the
Department may see
fit to forward and
particularly relating
to No. 1.</p>

<p>There are no other
matters of importance
in this Consulat district
of which the Department
has not been previously
advised.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States
Zanzibar, January 11 1891</p>

<p>Honorable W F Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington DC</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honour to
forward herewith copies of a
correspondence relating to an
additional duty levied on
imports to the German East
African Coast of Zanzibar,
and to address the Department
briefly regarding the <unclear/></p>

<p>The Dominion of the
Sultan of Zanzibar formerly
comprised the whole of the
East Central African Coast
and adjacent islands until
this year, when the Sultan
was induced by Germany
and England</p>

<pb facs="155735"/>

<p>and England to sell
to the former his sovereign
rights in about 400 miles
of this Coast, (transfered <unclear/>)<!--this is a date-->
leaving for himself the
islands of Zanzibar and
Bonba and a small piece
of Coast to the North, all
under a British Protectorate.</p>

<p>By the treaties with
Zanzibar, it is specially
provided that goods which
have paid 5% duty once
shall pass free through
any ports of Zanzibar
territory, and it has been
customary to import to
the island of Zanzibar
all goods intended for
East African trade and
paying duty there, <unclear/>
to the various Coast ports,
the island acting merely
as a distributing center
and not as a <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="155740"/>

<p>On December 22nd last,
notice was received from
the German Consulate,
<unclear/>, from Jany 10 1891,
"the duty" would be taken
on the German Coast
for account of the German
Government, meaning that
5% duty would be levied
on all goods imported to 
the German Coast, whether
they had previously paid
to the Zanzibar Customs 
or not- This duty is
now in force there.</p>

<p>The Americans have
of <unclear/> Roper, <unclear/>
hold in this city a lot of
goods destined expressly
for the German Coast, on
which they have paid 5%
duty to the Zanzibar Customs,
and on their <unclear/>
this fact to me and also
the impossibility of making
shipping</p>

<pb facs="155746"/>

<p>shipping and storage
arrangements in the
space of eight days. I
filed a protest against
this duty being levied
with the German Consul,
as per copy inclosed.</p>

<p>At the same time
I addressed H H the Sultan
through the British Agency,
protesting against another
duty being allowed to be
charged on goods already
passed at Zanzibar, and
claimed a free market,
or a drawback onall
American duty-paid goods
here for export to said Coast.
In reply, the British Agent
states that he is in a
similar situation in regard
to British subjects and is
unable to make any state-
ment until he is advised
by his Government, to
<unclear/></p>

<pb facs="155750"/>

<pb facs="155757"/>

<p>I am of the opinion
that, as the Sultan only
could sell something that
he possessed and he never
possessed the right to levy
a second duty of 5% on
goods duty-paid in Zan-
sibar, the Germans have
no legal rights to levy
such duty, and the 
Sultan is responsible for
allowing this state of things
(of course it being under-
stood that the Sultan
is but a name, England
being the responsible party)
As contracting party to
the treaties the Sultan
has agreed that one duty
of 5% passes all goods free
through all ports of his
dominions, and I believe
him to be responsible for
any <unclear/> caused by a
transfer of any port of
his dominions</p>

<pb facs="155801"/>

<p>without any notice what-
ever to the Treaty Powers.</p>

<p>The amount claimed
by <unclear/> Roper, <unclear/>
is 5% drawback on $<unclear/>
<unclear/> of duty-paid goods
specially imported for-
sale on the German Coast
and held by them in the
city of Zanzibar on the
1st of January <unclear/> say
$<unclear/>, and are submitting
this claim to the Depart-
ment I consider that we
have a clear case against
the Sultan through the
English Protectorate, and
trust the the Department
will indorce my opinion
and take proceedings
towards payment of the claim.

<p>Sir:
Understanding that you
have taken charge of the
Foreign Relations of HH the Sultan,
I have the honour to request that
you bring to the notice of His
Highness' Government the following,</p>

<p>The American house of
Roper, <unclear/> hold in this
city, a quantity of goods on which
they have paid 5% duty to the
Zanzibar Customs. Under
existing treaties, one payment
of 5% admits goods free to all
ports and parts of the Sultan's
Dominions, and in good faith
under this treaty right, these
goods were imported from the
United States</p>

in that portion of His Higness'

<p>On the 22nd inst, I received
notice from the German Consulate
that from January 1st 1891, duty
would be taken on the German
East African coast for account
of the German government, from
which I infer that some transfer
in the Coast Government has
been made although no notice
of any such transfer has been
received from anyone, at this
Consulate.</p>

<p>If this additional duty
is allowed to be levied on the
Coast at nine days notice, I am
of the opinion that a drawback
of 5% should be allowed by
HH the Sultan to <unclear/>
on all duty-paid goods held
by them</p>

<p>by them now in Zanzibar

or that some arrangement should

which these goods may be

<p>British Government
propose to take regarding
the numerous protests
and claims arising from 
this arbitrary Coast duty,
and nothing has occurred
to shake me in my opinion
that the Sultan is
responisble for a 5% drraw-
back on all duty-paid
goods held by American
merchants on January 1st 91
for German Coast trade.</p>

<p>The question of
making Zanzibar a free
port has been agitated
for some time and meets
with the approval of all
friends of Zanzibar and
as nearly everything is
now passed in bond, the
law to the Sultan would
be only the <unclear/> on
imports consumed in
the islands of Zanzibar
and <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="160347"/>

<p>and <unclear/> and <unclear/>
islands, which <unclear/>
I do not estimate at more
than coast of collecting.
It would therefore appear
that there is no obstacle
in making this a free
port, but the treaties pro-
vide that the Sultan
must provide suitable
Custom House and go-downs
and transhipment stores,
free of all storage charges
other than the 5% duty
take away this duty and 
we have the Sultan rem-
oving a Custom House for
nothing- Of course he
objects- It will therefore
be necessary to alter the
treaties to make this a
free port and any such
alterations would probably
be opposed by Germany
as against the interests
of the</p>

<pb facs="160350"/>

<p>Coast Colony opposite
as it doubtless would be.
it is my opinion that
a free-port will be the
only salvation of Zanzibar
and I should strongly
advocate any reasonable
surrender of treaty rights
as regards Custom House
charges, harbor or tonnage
dues, to bring it about.</p>

<p>The question of the
total prohibition of cheap
spirits imported for native
use is also being considered
and like the free-port
question is advocated by
the friends of the place
opposed by the Germans
and would necessitate a
change of treat. I am
<unclear/> strongly in favour
of absolutely prohibiting
the importation of low
proof spirits for native use</p>

<pb facs="160355"/>

<p>I also consider that
with a British Protectorate,
esterritorial rights have
ceased to be of value and
I think it would be for
the best interests of all
concerned, if nost of our
judicial powers were
transferred to the British
Court- In fact, as I
look at the situation here
I cannot see why the
English Government does
not make this a <unclear/>
<unclear/> and be done with
all these half-way
measures. Germany would
probably be the only power
to seriously object, and it
seems to me if the trans-
fer of the German Coast
had been used at its full
value England might
have had Zanzibar
without trouble.</p>

<p>In submitting my
views on these important
questions thus freely to
the Department, I trust
I have not exceded the
bounds of propriety.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant.

<p>Sir,
I have the honour to inform you
that, acting under instructions received
from Her Majesty's Government, I have
caused to be closed several shops,
belonging to Goanese subjects of
Portugal, in which an unlicensed
sale of liquor was being carried on
in defiance of the regulations issued
by the Protecting Power with a view
to fulfilling its obligations incurred
under Article xcl of the Brussels Act.
The owners of these shops had been
several times warned of the con-
sequences of offering defiance to
the Brussels Act and had been
advised</p>
