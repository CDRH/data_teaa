Sir,
                                    On or about the 16th of 
February last the Captian of the 
French gunboat <unclear>"Marabout"</unclear> acting
under orders, destroyed by setting 
them on fire, certain establishment
of the African natives on the Gaboon 
River.
        One of the esetablishment burned 
was an out station of the American 
Presbyterian mission situated on 





His Excellency Mr. E. Duchie 
            President of the Council
                    Ministor of Foregin Affairs 
                                                        Paris 

Nigenengue or Ningue Island
The <unclear>"Marabout"</unclear> it is time <unclear/> <unclear/>. 
fire to the property of the Mission
But its hostile course aroused <unclear/>
of the native tribes, who reached <unclear/>
Ningue-Ningue, after the <unclear>deployment</unclear>
of the Gunboat, broke into the 
building of the Mission and 
olundered everything it contained.
The members of the American Mission
who are represented by the 
Rev. Mr. Walker, had no opportunity
of saving their property.
They were not notified in advance 
by the French Authorities of any 
intended hostilities against the 
natives, and, to their knowledge 
the inhabitants of Ningue-Ningue 
had committed no act which 
could have given them reason 
to suppose thath any such action
was contemplated. It appears 
that some time begore the destruction 
of this village, the 
Captain of the Gunboat declared 
that there was no intention of 
proceeding against its people. 
It cannot I think be claimed 
that the French Authorities are 
not responsible for the destruction 
of the Mission, as the natives 
would certainly, never have
resorted to violence and plunder 
if war had not been waged 
against them. During the 30 
years the Mission has existed 
in Gaboon it has enjoyed the 
friendship of the natives, who 
were often left alone in charge 
of the building and property.
        In presence of these facts
the American Mission of Gaboon
claims an indemnity of three
thousand five hundred francs
(3500. frs) for the loss sustained 
in consequence of the action of 
the French authorities of the
Colony, and I am instructed 
by my Government to lay this 
claim before your Excellency?
        The amount of property 
destroyed is of no consequence to a 
Government like Grance, but it 
is a large amount for poor 
clergymen who have exiled 
themselves in a distant and 
uncivilized land for the cause 
of religion and morality. 
        At the time of this unpleasant 
incident, the Rev. Mr. 
Walker, speaking in the name 
of the Mission, applied to Captain 
Clerin Commanding the Colony 
for the indemnity which is here
claimed. But this officer, through
replying thath the claim would 
be submitted to the proper 
authority seems to have 
misunderstood its real foundation
and true character. 
        I cannot believe that the 
French Government after a full 
examination of the facts will
adopt the defence outlined byh 
Commandant Clerin thath the 
Mission station trespassed upon 
French Territory, as such <unclear>contention</unclear>
would not effect the nature of 
the claim. 
        The simple question of 
issue seems to be whether the 
Mission station was pillaged
by hostile navtives in consequence
of the destruction ordered by the
French Authorities and if this 
destruction was called for by 
such an emergency og self defense
as would prevent warning to 
non combattants.
        In the latter case the French 
Government will, doubtless, of its
own accord, lender indemnification
to these worthy men, who, since 
their esstablishment in Gaboon
more than a quarter of a century 
ago have held the most cordial
relations with the Colonial 
Authorities and have been a 
powerful adjunct to the civilizing 
and moral tendencies of French
rule on this part of the African 
Coast.
        I avail myself of this occasion 
to renew the assurance of the 
distinguished consideration with
which I have the honor to be.
            Your Excellency's 
                Most obedient servant
                        L.P. Morton
