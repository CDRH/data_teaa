Port of Gorée.
</ab>

<p>
Today March 11th 1840,
the commercial commission of Gorée, reunited itself, on
the convocation of its President, to listen to the
lecture of a ministerial dispatch from December 2nd 1839,
relative to the question of establishing the respective equality of the
taxes affecting the flag, in regard to the french and 
american vessels weighing the navigation between the United States
and Gorée and reciprocally.
</p>

<p>
were present.

</p>

<p>
The Commission ignores what are the rights that
one pays to the United States on the merchandise that is
admitted there, but it would be necessary that they are made
weak so that they make less than those perceived
in Gorée on the products of the Union that are admitted
in the rights and are found ported opposite

<p>
in Gorée on the products of the Union that are submitted and
of which the rights are found ported opposite.
</p>

<p>
It is well recognized that the rights perceived in Gorée are
excessively weak, comparatively to those perceived
in France.
</p>

<p>
Martinique and Guadeloupe are expediting
vessels to the United States; these vessels when they are on 
ballast only pay a right of 0.50, whereas those
expedited from St Louis seen from Gorée even though not being equal.
that in ballast, are submitted to a right of tonnage of one
Dollar, and yet when the american vessels
are admitted to introduce laws to the colonies of the West,
<unclear>Cabaes</unclear> and provisions they pay on the products 61%
which is much more risen than the rights perceived in Gorée
on identical articles, and on the meal a right that is
20. f. at least per barrel.
</p>

<p>
As for that which is said relatively on the exclusion
of american vessels in St Louis, it is not for
the <del>su</del> Country <del>se</del> of the Union only that this non admission
has place, it extends to all of the flags and yet
the other nations do not claim this in order to
make us pay a higher rate for the right of
tonnage of the vessels that are expedited from Senegal, we
can cite the support of that which we advance, that
french vessels expedited form the port of St Louis, Senegal,

</p>

<pb facs="20160614_145055.jpg"/>

<p>
only paying in England that which the french vessels
pay leaving from completely different <unclear/>; we <unclear/> <unclear/>
<unclear/> that the products <unclear/> <unclear/> from the coast
of Africa only paying in England the same right
to which are imposed the <unclear/>.
</p>

<p>
In Gambia, to <unclear>Rathard,</unclear> we only pay the
same tonnage and anchorage as the <unclear>nationnaux, we pay</unclear>
equally the same right as the english who come
directely from England, and yet the English are
not admitted in St Louis.
</p>

<p>
The Commission decides in the majority of four
voices on its:
</p>

<p>
Then the americans only pay on our island
the weak right of <unclear/> per barrel, and still are
we in the obligation of taking the <unclear/> in <unclear/>
to place them aboard their boats without taking
any retribution; that their nation by reciprocity does
perceive more when our vessels are going to visit
the ports of America.
</p>

<p>
Or, that one makes it paid to the americans one
Dollar like they impose on us, or 5. 25; it would
result in a large good for french commerce
The Americans would not come in as big of a number
</p>

<p>
the Americans would not come in <supplied>as big of a number</supplied>
and the proprietors of french vessels being certain not
to have concurrence, or to have one nearly
as bad, would expedite a big number of vessels
which would be advantageous for our commerce that do
not often find freight in Senegal for France
would do operations linked in porting oxen to the Antilles
and raising again for one of the ports of the Union to
return to Gorée or to St Louis.
</p>

<p>
In either of these two cases, it would result in
a large benefit for the <unclear>fise</unclear> and in the last a
an even bigger good for french navigation and 
commerce.
</p>

<p>
There is another observation that must especially be
taken into consideration, which is that the americans only want
the most recent receipt in payment of their <unclear>marches</unclear>
that the individuals that are leaving the Colony to never
return.
</p>

<p>
It should be remarked in addition, that the americans
pay on the skins, rubbers, <unclear>bois de cail-cedra</unclear> at least
on all of the products that they are authorized to export,
the same right that that to which the french are
subjugated
</p>

<pb facs="20160614_145140.jpg"/>

<p>
subjugated at the exit, even when these products are
directed to the french ports.

is finished and the present official report signed the <unclear>jous</unclear> but
