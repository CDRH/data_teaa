<p>United States Consulate.<lb/>
Zanzibar. Dec. 20. 1886<lb/>
To the Hon.<lb/>
Third Assist Sec'y of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform
you that the 14th inst.
a fleet of six German Men-of-war
under Admiral Knorr
arrived at this port; followed
on the 15th by two French
and one English is now
lying in the harbor.</p>

<p>The object of this movement 
has not yet been made public
but it is understood that
the Sultan has been compelled 
to cede a large portion of his
Coast territory to Germany and
one seaport to England.</p>

<p>This, of course is the end
of Arab power on this Coast forever.</p>

<pb facs="132125"/>

<p>In my opinion American
interests and all foreign interests
but Germany, will suffer
greatly by these changes and
it is greatly to be regretted
that some Government would
not assist the Sultan's Government 
against this German
robbery.</p>

<p>Considering that the Sultan's 
power to control the various
wild &#38; lawless tribes which are
under his scrutiny, will be
materially weakened and that
our large American interests
are absolutely without protection 
in case of riot or bombardment, 
and that as the
first treaty power with the
Sultan we should be in some
way represented in the important
changes and transfers soon
to take place. I recommend
that an American man-of-war
of good sire be sent to remain

<pb facs="132131"/>

here at Zanzibar until this 
trouble is definitely settled.</p>

<p>I trust that the Government
will take immediate
action in this matter as it
is one which admits of no 
delay.</p>

<p>As representative of the
two largest houses in Zanzibar
I feel very anxious about the
large amount of property belonging
to me lying exposed
to fire or any incendiary acts.
also the future of the American
trade seems very uncertain and
I fear will be very much injured
by the precedence which this 
affair will give Germany.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir:<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant<lb/>
E. D. Roper Jr<lb/>
Act'g U.S. Consul</p>
