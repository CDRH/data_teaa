<p>No. 68. <unclear></unclear> Consular.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia;
May 10, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
transmit, herewith, copies of
all correspondence, relative
to the estate of the late William
Porker, between James
(George by mistake on my
part) H. Lewis, the
Administrator of the esstate; the
State Department, Monrovia,
and this Consulate General.</p>

<p>By a close reading
of my letter to James H.
Lewis, the Administrator, in
whose house Porker, resided
and diedl you will observe
that</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4010.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>that I set up the claim
that Porker was and died
an American citizen. You
will further observe, that
James H. Lewis, the
Administrator, in none of his
replies, as Administrator;
denies my claim that
Porker was an American
citizen; but tacitly admits
my claim by promising to
forward the effects of the
deceased to this Consulate General.</p>

<p>In my No 4/1901, Miscellaneous,
January 29, 1901, to
the State Department, Monrovia;
complaining of the
silency and non action
of the Administrator; the
State Department, in reply
informed me that the
Attorney General, had been
instructed to correspond with
the said James H. Lewis,
the</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4011.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>the Administrator; advising
him to comply with the
terms of the law &amp;c.</p>

<p>In reply to the Attorney
General's letter; upon inquiry,
at the Executive Mansion, the
President informed me that
James H. lewis, the Administrator
had answered the
Attorney General; informing
him that he, James H.
Lewis, had sold the effects
of the deceased, and would
soon come down and make
a report to the Attorney General,
which he James H.
Lewis, the Administrator,
thought, would be satisfacotry
to the Attorney General.
Having reeived such
information from the President,
I demurred, at the
expressed desire to make
his report to the Attorney
General, and filed my
Protest,</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4012.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>Protest No. 10/1901, Miscellaneous,
March 16, 1901, to the State
Department, Monrovia.
To this Protest, the Liberian
Government, to date, has
failed to make a direct
reply, to this Consulate
General. It has, however,
indirectly, replied, by instructing
the Hon. R. J. B. Watson,
the Superintendent of Grand
Cape Mount Territory, to
cause the said James H.
Lewis,, the Administrator,
to make an immediate
report, transmitting the
proceeds &amp;c of said estate,
direct to me.</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of the
report of James H.
Lewis, the Administrator,
I was confined to my
bed, very sick; but without
opening the report; I directed
the Secretary of the Legation
to</p>
