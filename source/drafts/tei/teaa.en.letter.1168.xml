<pb n="Roll6-1099.jpg"/>

<p>20</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, August 22, 1891.</p>

<p>Hon., William F. Wharton,<lb/>
Acting Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor respectfully
to acknowledge receipt of your
Nos 10, &amp; 11, of 18th &amp; 21st ultimo: the
latter enclosing copy of a letter
from Rebecca J. Appleton, and other
of the family of Mr Clark, late
Minister of the United States at
Monrovia.</p>

<p>Your instruction to take the
necessary steps to cause the transportation
of the remains of the deceased
Minister, to Muscatine, Iowa, U.S.A,
will be carried out as soon as
it is safe to do so. There being no
facility of <sic>embalmment</sic> in Liberia, the
remains were interred without,
and cannot be exhumed for
transportation immediately, but

<pb n="Roll6-1100.jpg"/>

but may be in three or four months
hence.</p>

<p>I thank you for your advice in
reference to the shipment of Mr
Clark's personal affects, and expense
incurred thereby. I had acted in
accordance with same prior to its receipt
as per enclosed copy of my letter to
Mr. George W. Appleton, of the 20th ultimo.</p>

<p>By the last mail I received a
certificate of his appointment and
commission, Administrator of the
Estate of Minister Clark deceased.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir:<lb/>
Your obedient Servant,<lb/>
Beverly Y. Payne<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul General.</p>

<p>Enclosure<lb/>
1. Copy of Mr Payne's to Mr Appleton,
July 20th 1891.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States.<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, July 20, 1891.</p>

<p>Mr George W. Appleton.<lb/>
Muscatine, Iowa.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I have written you
several letters since the death of
your Father, and I am without
any in reply. This serves to
advise that I shipped all his
personal affects to you on the 16th inst.,
per Bark "Liberia" in care of Messrs
Yates &amp; Porterfield, 19, William Street,
New York City, to whom you
will make application for same.</p>

<p>I enclose a copy of Inventory
and two keys to trunks, which I trust
you will find in order. I also
enclose six family letters, three of which 
I did not recognize to be
from his relatives, hence I opened
them. I shall forward the Account
at earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>I remain, Your ob't serv't<lb/>
Beverly Y. Payne<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul Genl.</p>
