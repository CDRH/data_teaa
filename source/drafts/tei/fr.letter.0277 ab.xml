<p>Missionary Asks
Inquiry On Congo</p>
    
<p> Secretary of State Told Libel
Suits Threaten Religious Workers.</p>

<p> The Rev. S.H. Chester, D.D., of 
Nashville representing the missionary
department of the Southern Presbyterian
Church, called upon Secretary
Bacon today to request that the State
Department through Consul General
W.W. Handley at Boma, investigate
the circumstances of the trial of the
American missionaries who are charged
with libel by the authorities of the 
Congo Free State in connection with
their reports on the conditions of the
natives.</p>
    
<p> The reports of the missionaries, of
whom there are several alleged that
through the labor imposed upon the natives,
the Bakuba tribe has been reduced 
to a condition of famine, and
that the me who are obliged to turn
in certain amounts of rubber of ivory
each year have so little time to devote
to crop-raising that they are unable to
sustain themselves and their families.
Included in the reports were pictures of
natives in chains because they had
failed to comply with the demands of
the government.</p>
    
<p>The libel suit is not the frist to be
brought by the Congo authorities for 
alleged offenses of this kind. Edgar
Stannard, a British missionary, was 
tried and found guilty. It was charged 
by the missionaries that certain evidence
was suppressed in order to give a
basis for a verdict.</p>
    
<p>It is to forestall any action of this
kind that Dr. Chester has requested the
State Department to keep the trial under
observation.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p> Consul General Wheatley, of the Congo
Free State, who was seen at the New 
Willard, spoke in regard to the reported
request made of Secretary Bacon by a 
representatice of the Souther Presbyterian
Church that an investigation be
made into the circumstances of the trial
of certain American missionaries in the
Congo Free State for libel, in connection
with their reports of the condition of the
natives, and said:</p>
    
<p>"The trouble seems to have arisen from
the fact that certain Protestant missionaries
in the Congo, who apparently have
little sympathy with the language, laws,
or religion of the Belgians, have wanted
to run the country according to their own
ideas, and have used indiscreet language
about Belgian officers who disagreed with
them.</p>

<p>"According to the accounts which we
have from trustworth sources in the
Congo, Count Ferdinand de Grunne, who
is a young man of high reputation, and
a member of one of the best families in 
Belgium, found it his duty, for the maintenance
of public order, to compel certain
natives who were loafing abou the 
American Presbyterian Mission at Luebo
to return to the tribes to whnich they
belonged-just as the American government
compels the Indians to stay on 
their reservations. For the action some
of the American missionaries seem to
have called him names, and brought
charges for cruelty, and even of slave-
trading, against him. It seems that the 
Rev. Mr. Morrison, of the American
Presbyterian Mission, was the chief person
with whom Count de Grunne had
putations. Then Count de Grunne <unclear></unclear>
suit for libel."</p>
