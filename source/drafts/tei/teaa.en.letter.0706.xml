<p>Your Excellency,
I have the honour to forward
Your Excellency copies of despatches,
respecting addressed, to the Prime
Minister of Madagascar +way self
to His Excellency the French Minister
for Foreign Affairs.</p>
    
<p>As Ambassador of H.W. the
Queen of Madagascar for the</p>
    
<ab>His Excellency,
The President of the United States 
of America</ab>    
    
<pb facs="20170614_160338"/>
<p>Treaty Powers is in clearly any duty
to those Powers + to Her Majesy,
in view of the past + present time 
of policy pursued by the Govern
ment of the French Republic in
reference to Madagascar, + the 
attitude of protection it has 
assumed over her independent
Foreign State, to take this im-
mediate occassion to adopt the 
<unclear/> measure of acquaniting 
the Powers, that no Porlectorate
of any kind whatsoever, has ever</p>    
    
<pb facs="20170614_160344"/>
<p>been ceded to France by the Queen 
of Madagascar or Her Govern-
ment, + as my despated +
In, de, Frequent confirms, rather
than acknowledge the Portectorate
claimed by France, Her Majesty
Government will advise Her
Majesty to appeal to the nation 
whether he shall, or, not
resent again to the <unclear/>
-ment of arms.
I make no comment</p>    
  
<pb facs="20170614_160351"/>
<p>upon the conduct of the Govern-
ment the French Republic, or re-
flection upon to policy. I 
state, without hesitation, the
<unclear/> restore of Mada-
gascar not to allow the inter-
nal administration of her
Kingdom to the interfered with.</p>
    
<p>I may, however, benefit un-
plain that the ratification of
the Treaty of Peace of 17th
December, 1885, (a printed</p>

<pb facs="20170614_160359"/>
<p>copy which I now submit)
was made absolutely dependent upon 
the receipt beforehand of the 
explanatory letter (in the nations 
of a protocol) of the Representa-
tives for the French Republic,
is these examination of the 
dates <unclear/> 
momentarily prove, of <unclear/>
if Mr French Government
<unclear/> the letter + <unclear/>
of their Representative, upon use</p>    
    
<pb facs="20176014_160405"/>    
<p>faith of which the Treaty was <unclear/>
the Malagasy Government, on the other 
hand have the right to look upon
the Treaty as numm + void.</p>  
   
<p>The Government of Her French
Republic is in the <unclear/>
position of putting upon a Treaty
a consulation opposed to that 
which her own plemipotention
have placed on record as
conveying the <unclear/> meaning 
of the tent. The letter of the</p>

<p>that we fear that the total destruction of our 
large and valuable interests in this kingdom will
result from this action"</p>    
    
<p>We therefore beg your Excellency in the interests
of the Americans resident in this island an 
those of our fellow citizens in the W.J. whose 
commercial interests are identified with ours and 
in the name of humanity, to interpose the good
offices of the United States in our behalf, to the 
end that a speedy mediation and cessation of
hostilities between Madagascar and France may 
result and ourselves be allowed to pursue our
peaceful avocations without further damage or 
hindrance'
And your petitioners will ever pray"</p>
