<note>Department of State Received Dec 21 1886</note>

<p>12 Pall Mall SW.</p>

<p>Your Excellency,</p>

<p>I have the honour to forward
Your Excellency copies of despatches,
respectively addressed, to the Prime
Minister of Madagascar &amp; myself
to His Excellency the French Minister
for Foreign Affairs.</p>
    
<p>As Ambassador of H.M. the
Queen of Madagascar to the
    
<fw type="address">To His Excellency,<lb/>
The President of the United States 
of America<lb/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</fw>    
    
<pb facs="20170614_160338"/>

Treaty Powers, it is clearly my duty
to those Powers &amp; to Her Majesty,
in view of the past &amp; present <unclear>time</unclear> 
of policy pursued by the Government 
of the French Republic in
reference to Madagascar, &amp; the 
attitude of protection it has 
assumed over our independent
Sovereign State, to take this immediate 
occasion to adopt the 
peremptory measure of acquainting 
the Powers, that no Protectorate
of any kind whatever, has ever  
    
<pb facs="20170614_160344"/>

been ceded to France by the Queen 
of Madagascar or Her Government, 
&amp;, as my despatch to
M. de Freycinet confirms, &amp; rather
than acknowledge the Protectorate
claimed by France, Her Majesty's
Government will advise Her
Majesty to appeal to the nation 
whether he shall, or, not
resort again to the arbitrament
of arms.</p>

<p>I make no comment  
  
<pb facs="20170614_160351"/>

upon the conduct of the Government 
of the French Republic, or reflection 
upon its policy. I 
state, without hesitation, the
<unclear>unalterable</unclear> resolve of Madagascar 
not to allow the internal 
administration of her
Kingdom to be interfered with.</p>
    
<p>I may, however, benefit explain 
that the ratification of
the Treaty of Peace of 17th
December, 1885, (a printed

<pb facs="20170614_160359"/>

copy of which I now submit)
was made absolutely dependent upon 
the receipt beforehand of the 
explanatory letter (in the <unclear>nature</unclear> 
of a protocol) of the Representatives 
for the French Republic,
as <unclear>the</unclear> examination of the 
dates &amp; circumstances will
incontestably prove. Of course
if the French Government repudiate
the letter &amp; <unclear>postscript</unclear>
of their Representative, upon the    
    
<pb facs="20176014_160405"/>    

faith of which the Treaty was <unclear>concluded</unclear>,
the Malagasy Government, on the other 
hand, have the right to look upon
the Treaty as null &amp; void.</p>  
   
<p>The Government of the French
Republic is in the singular
position of putting upon a Treaty
a construction opposed to that 
which her own Plenipotentiaries
have placed on record as
conveying the precise meaning 
of the <unclear>text</unclear>. The letter of the
