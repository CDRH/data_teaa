<note>Department of State Received Dec 21 1886</note>

<p>12 Pall Mall SW.</p>

<p>Your Excellency,</p>

<p>I have the honour to forward
Your Excellency copies of despatches,
respectively addressed, to the Prime
Minister of Madagascar &amp; myself
to His Excellency the French Minister
for Foreign Affairs.</p>
    
<p>As Ambassador of H.M. the
Queen of Madagascar to the
    
<fw type="address">To His Excellency,<lb/>
The President of the United States 
of America<lb/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</fw>    
    
<pb facs="20170614_160338"/>

Treaty Powers, it is clearly my duty
to those Powers &amp; to Her Majesty,
in view of the past &amp; present <unclear>time</unclear> 
of policy pursued by the Government 
of the French Republic in
reference to Madagascar, &amp; the 
attitude of protection it has 
assumed over our independent
Sovereign State, to take this immediate 
occasion to adopt the 
peremptory measure of acquainting 
the Powers, that no Protectorate
of any kind whatever, has ever  
    
<pb facs="20170614_160344"/>

been ceded to France by the Queen 
of Madagascar or Her Government, 
&amp;, as my despatch to
M. de Freycinet confirms, &amp; rather
than acknowledge the Protectorate
claimed by France, Her Majesty's
Government will advise Her
Majesty to appeal to the nation 
whether he shall, or, not
resort again to the arbitrament
of arms.</p>

<p>I make no comment  
  
<pb facs="20170614_160351"/>

upon the conduct of the Government 
of the French Republic, or reflection 
upon its policy. I 
state, without hesitation, the
<unclear>unalterable</unclear> resolve of Madagascar 
not to allow the internal 
administration of her
Kingdom to be interfered with.</p>
    
<p>I may, however, benefit explain 
that the ratification of
the Treaty of Peace of 17th
December, 1885, (a printed

<pb facs="20170614_160359"/>

copy of which I now submit)
was made absolutely dependent upon 
the receipt beforehand of the 
explanatory letter (in the <unclear>nature</unclear> 
of a protocol) of the Representatives 
for the French Republic,
as <unclear>the</unclear> examination of the 
dates &amp; circumstances will
incontestably prove. Of course
if the French Government repudiate
the letter &amp; <unclear>postscript</unclear>
of their Representative, upon the    
    
<pb facs="20176014_160405"/>    

faith of which the Treaty was <unclear>concluded</unclear>,
the Malagasy Government, on the other 
hand, have the right to look upon
the Treaty as null &amp; void.</p>  
   
<p>The Government of the French
Republic is in the singular
position of putting upon a Treaty
a construction opposed to that 
which her own Plenipotentiaries
have placed on record as
conveying the precise meaning 
of the <unclear>text</unclear>. The letter of the

<pb facs="20170614_160409"/>

Representatives for the French Republic 
is in the nature of a Protocol &amp; must
be held to conclusively settle the
meaning of the Treaty.</p>

<p>Finally, I leave it to the world at
large to decide, whether, when the two 
letters&#8212;namely&#8212;the letter now called
the Appendix to Her Treaty, handed <unclear extent="one word"/> by
the French Representatives to me, as the
Malagasy Plenipotentiary, &amp; my exchange
letter, or Convention, given to them&#8212;
are compared, whether, I repeat it, the

<pb facs="20170614_160414"/>

last named letter, ie, the Secret
Treaty, is not more than a
fair quid pro quo for the
former.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be<lb/>
with the highest consideration<lb/>
You Excellency's<lb/>
Most obedient 
humble servant<lb/>
Digby Willoughby <unclear>Genl</unclear><lb/>
Ambassador from the Queen of Madagascar.</p>

<note>Copy</note>

<p>12 Pall Mall S.W.<lb/>
12 November 1886</p>

<p>Your Excellency</p>

<p>France &amp; Madagascar
are at serious variance respecting
the interpretation of the Treaty of Peace
of the 17th December 1885 &amp; its Appendix
dated 9th of January 1886.
This Treaty, Your Excellency is
quite cognizant, was ratified
by myself, on behalf of the Queen
of Madagascar, on the 10th of January
1886, having previously received
as the sole condition of my ratification
the letter of interpretation or Appendix
dated 9th of January 1886 &amp; signed

<fw type="address">A Son Excellence 
Mons de Freycinet<lb/>
Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres<lb/>
Paris</fw>

<pb facs="20170614_160515"/>

by the <sic>Represenatives</sic> for the French
Republic. Notwithstanding the
self congratulations of the French
Press, that the Prime Minister of
Madagascar had succumbed to the
pressure brought to bear upon him
by France&#8212;to which I give an 
unqualified denial. I regret that
I am constrained to inform you
that the differences alluded to are
bound to endure whilst France
deems it fit to pursue, through
her Agents in Madagascar, a
policy of bewilderment, &amp; to treat
the Queens Envoy in Europe &amp; the
bearer of gifts to the President of the 
French Republic in a temporizing
manner. A policy of inactivity
lacking, as it does, clearness &amp;

<pb facs="20170614_160521"/>

resolution, will neither <unclear extent="one word"/>
<unclear>nor</unclear> <unclear extent="one word"/> the difficulty.
I have visited France to confer
with your Excellency, &amp; to come to a
friendly understanding. When
prepared as <unclear extent="one word"/>, &amp; am now to
look the difficulties straight in the
face, &amp; if possible, to overcome them
I have met with nothing but
want of resolution on the part of the
French Cabinet.</p>

<p>By the last mail the Prime
Minister of Madagascar sent me
an open letter addressed to Your
Excellency, but has left it to me
as the Malagasy Ambassador
to use my discretion in forwarding
it to its destination. It is the 
latest, &amp; most emphatic expression
<catchwords>of the</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170614_160529"/>

of the unalterable opinion of the
Queen &amp; Her Government. It is
briefly to this effect. The Queen
will not allow any interference
on the part of the French Agent, in the
internal administration of the
Kingdom of Madagascar, in 
such points as raising <unclear extent="one word"/>
to leasing of Customs dues &amp;c &amp;c
&amp; rather than admit such interference
will <unclear>again</unclear> <unclear>go</unclear> to the nation to 
ascertain the national will. What
the issue of such action will be
I prefer to </p>
