<p>No. 63. Consular
Legation of the United States.
Monrovia Liberia;
February 19, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to say
acknowledge the receipt
February 18, 1901, of your
No. 30. Consular G. of Jan.
9, 1901, in which you
acknowledge the receipt of my
No. 55, Consular of Nov. 27,
1900; in which I reported
the death of William Porker,
an American citizen, late of
Spokane, Washington. In
reply to your No. 30, Consular
G. I have to say, I did
not forward said No. 55,
Consular, as a final report
relative</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3178.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>relative to the demise of Wm.
Porker, but neither as a matter
of information. Mr. Porker, an
Odd Fellow died at some
distance from this Consulate
General, the Probate Judge of
Cape Mount Territory, had
appointed George H. Lewis;
also an Odd Fellow, and
the Sheriff of said Cape
Mount Territory with whom
Porker had lodged, during
his short stay at Robertsport,
as administrator of the
effects &amp;c. of the deceased. At the
time of writing, I saw that
some considerable time
would necessarily, have to
elapse, as will as much
correspondence, before I could
be pleased in a portion to
submit a proper official
report &amp;c, of the demise and settlement
of the said estate, Hence,
my short reference to the
death</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3179.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>death of Porker, without attempting
to give particular or writing
to his widow; hoping, in a very
few days, to have been enabled
to have given a full account
of his death, effects &amp;c. But, ever,
at this writing I have to say,
I have not been able to get
possession of the Inventory nor
effects of the deceased, from the
said administrator George H.
Lewis, the Sheriff of Cape Mount
Territory. Hence, I did on Jan.
29, 1901, file a complaint
and demand with the
State Department. Monrovia:
for the delivery of the said
Inventory and affects by the
said George H. Lewis to
me.</p>

<p>The State Department
has referred the matter to
the Department of justice,
and the Attorny General has
written the Judge of the
Probate</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3180.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>Probate Court for said Territory,
demanding him to forward the
said Inventory effects &amp;c to me.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith,
Consul General.</p>
