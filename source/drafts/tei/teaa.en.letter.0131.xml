<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
24th May 1881</p>

<p>Sir<lb/>
I have the honor to
again draw your attention to my
Despatch No 56 dated as far back as
23rd July 1880, and I hear from
Mr Colville that the Bills drawn by
him have not been accepted as yet
consequently I am obliged to pay to
this gentleman the amount of Salary
he ought to have received during my
absence in England viz:--</p>

<p>June 30th 1879      $172.08<lb/>
Sept 30th         --           $250.00<lb/>
Dec  31st         --           $231.61<lb/>
Jany 12th 1880             $32.96<lb/>
                Total              $686.65</p>

<p>I therefore beg to draw the 
attention of the Department to this
and to place the matter before them 
if they think it just that I should
pay this amount without receiving
any recompense from the Government
<catchwords>Mr</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0131.003"/>
Mr Colville was appointed
with the sanction of the Department,
and with the understanding that he
would receive the salary during my 
absence, as has been hitherto the
custom; otherwise I do not think he 
would have accepted the Appointment,
and there was no other person that
I could have delivered the Consulate
to at the time.</p>
