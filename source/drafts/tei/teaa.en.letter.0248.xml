Hotel de Russie State
Hanburg, July 9. 1862.

To Hon. W.H.Seward
Sec. of State
<unclear></unclear> 

Sir,

Having left Liberia in March
duly rested with authority to transact
any necessary official business for the 
governemnt of Liberia with any other
governments, it was my original 
purpose to visit the United States
of America, after having finished
any business with Her Britannic 
Majesty's government. Being anxious 
to negotiate a treaty on behalf of the 
government of Liberia with the United 
States government, I have for nearly 
three months been watching the 
progress of the passage of the bill.

by

by Congress recognizing and 
establishing diplomatic relations between 
the United States government and 
the government of Liberia, the 
passage of which I was highly
gratified to see announced in the 
propers a week or two before I left
London; and I would have 
immediately gone over to the United 
States for the purpose aforesaid, but was 
deterred by the consideration that very 
likely the great pressure of business
upon, and the perplexity and anxiety 
of the government of the United States,
growing out of the unrighteous rebellion 
of some  of the States, right render 
such a proposition (unclear), just 
now to secure such speedy action by 
the government of the United States 
is the necessary shortness of my
visit there would require.

As

As I prupose returning to 
London, and shall proboably then 
decide whether I will visit the
United States early in August, or 
return to Liberia from London, the 
object of this communication is 
simply to inquire so what will be Your
Excellency's pleasure in the promises;
first, whether Yout Excellency favors the 
negotations, on behalf of the United States 
government, of a treaty of amity and 
commerce with the government of 
Liberia if so, then through what 
medium do you suggest that it shall 
be effected? by my visiting the United 
States for that purpose, or your
government empowering someone to 
effect that object with me in London?
Either method will be agreeable to 
me. I am very deservous*, and 
I think it very important, that 

a

a treaty should be negotiated between 
the two governments before my return
to Liberia and the commencoment of 
the session of the Liberian Legislature.
The Hon. Mr. Adams, your minister 
at the Court of St. James, has 
already signified to me the pleasure 
it would afford him to do so, if (unclear)
authorized by his government.

I shall feel particularly obliged
if Your Excellency can, amid the 
pressure of business, conveniently 
place one in possession of a reply 
to this communication in all of 
next month (August). 

I have the honor to be 
Your obident servant, 
Stephin "A" Bennen
