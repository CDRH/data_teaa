<!-- BEGIN TRANSCRIBING -->

The Liberian Government having been made 
cognisant of the said agreement, submits the 
following propositions thereon:
Considering that the district comprising its 
south eastern teritory situated between Cape Palmas 
and the San Pedro River were included within 
the limits of the State of Maryland in Liberia 
as far back as the years 1835-50, and that no 
counter claim was set up at that time by any
European State.

Considering also that the State of Maryland 
in Liberia was peacefully incorporated with the 
Republic of Liberia in the year 1854, that said 
incoportation was then and there published to 
the world, and that no protest agaisnt it was made
by any European State, that therefore said 
incorporation has had the sanction and knowledgement 
of the civilized world for nearly half a century,
and that it is only within the last six years that 

any

any claim to said territory have been preferred 
by the Government of France.

Considering also that these territories are 
responsible for a portion of the Foreign debt of the 
Republic,

Considering also that America Liberian 
nuscious and schools have in the past and are 
at present established in the said districts 
and up the Cavalla River.

Considering that the Map of Africa recently
published by the Royal Geographical Novels of the Belgium
show the proposed inferior boundary of the 
Republic at its greatest width at Roporo in 
the Condo country, which would only give 
the Republic an interior extent of about 40
miles; and that the whole of the Condo 
COuntry was formally ceded to the Republic 
by King Momora Sav in the years 1868-69.

Considering also that the countries between 
Monrovia and the interior slope of the Western 
Mandingo plateau were explored by 
Benjamin Anderson at the instance of the 
Liberian government during the years 1868,1873,
and 1874 and confirmed to the Republic by 
Special Treaties, and now set down in 

the 

the French map of that region as unexplored and 
therefore liable to become a protectorate of France.

Considering also that the present or prospective 
deluincitation* according to the Map referred so 
would cut off or separate from the Republic populations 
that have been peacefully under its 
sphere of influence for the last 40 years, and 
would also dperive the Republic of all acess to 
the River Niger, contrary to the Riverland doctrine 
now acknowledged in, Europe as binding with 
respect to European acquisitors on the African 
Continent.

COnsidering also that the Republic of Liberia 
is not a European State, but was an Independent 
African Government in exsistence long 
before the era of the Berlin Conference and 
was in possession of said teritory at a period 
considerably inferior to the convening of said 
Conference, and was not invited to participate 
in its deliberations, and ought not therefore to 
be bound by the rules thereat prescibed for the 
conduct of European Powers in making fresh 
acquistions of territory in Africa, and that 
Republic seeks only that territory which 
has for so long period been acknowledged to 

rightfully

rightfully belong to her and the right of 
her Riverland.

For the above reasons the Republic 
considers that her boundaries ought in 
all right and justice to extend form the 
Mannual River on the North to the San 
Pedro River on the South, and inferior wars
from the Sea coast to the River Niger in
accordance with the Riverlands law. This 
regualtion of her boundaries would be 
very little moment to the European States
who have acquired such extensive Empires 
in Africa, but is of vital importance to 
the Republic of Liberia and would further 
more sufficently meet her just aspirations.

The Republic therefore protest against 
the conclusion of the said Agreement, so 
far as the deprivation of Liberian territorty 
by France is concerned and solicits 
the good offices of the United States 
Government to avert her impending loss of 
territory on her sea board and inferior.
