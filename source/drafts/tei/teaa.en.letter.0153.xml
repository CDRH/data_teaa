<p>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
September 30th, 1882.</p>

<p>Hon. J.C. Bancraft Davis
Asst. Sectry of  State
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir,
I have the honor most respectfully to state that
Capt of Frigate, Ferreira do Amaral (Francisco
Joaquim) has been appointed governor general
of Angola and arrived here by the last mail 
steamer from Lisbon, he is accompanied by his 
wife, and the aid <unclear>de camp</unclear>.</p>

<p>Governor Amaral is, as I must judge by his 
friendly reception of me and bhy the good wishes
he has toward Americans, determined to help
the American's trades adn commerece on this 
coast. A railroad is much needed, and a 
free grant of land for 99 years can be 
attained by any american company willing
to invest some capital;  The Country is very 
rich but has no developments, In all the 
reports I am now collecting, and my own 
personal judgement which will be forwarded
to the State Department for my quarter
ending December 1882. <unclear/> will be able 
to see what a R.R. Company here

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0153.002"/>
<note>No 30</note>
would be able to realize in 10 years, a 
great profit would consequently be tge 
result ad new spirit put in this wealth 
but forgotten country.</p>

<p>Governor Amaral while talking to me
about Americans, its commerce, trade
goods Sa. mentioned that it was strange
that a <unclear/> so will know would still
keep whole <unclear/> in countries and
ports where there was no need of such,
and that in his belief an am: Man of 
War was needed at least twice a year 
on this craft his excellency idea's on this
matter is supported by everyone I know,
and in my conversation with several
natives chief and trades on this coast
I have been told the following.</p>

<p>You call yourself a representative of a great
country were all kinds of goods abound,
but where are they? You say that your
nation is greater and larger then
Holland, France, England how can
you prove it to us; the English have 
plenty men of war along this coast,
Dutch, French and English goods are 
daily coming by the English mail
and other merchants, vessels. On the

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0153.003"/>
<note>No 37</note>
coast you see nothing but English trading 
Houses, and the goods we are now wearing
are English, Why then if your country is so
Big as you mention and has so much time
goods gun powder Sa Sa that you do not
bring some to us to seem and trade: Why 
do you not put in our country Americans
trading Houses; protect them, and he found
to them, and if you have such great
ships as England has  <unclear/> big guns,
Why not let us see them--"</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant
L de R du Verge
U.S. Consul</p>
