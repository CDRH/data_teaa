                    Mister and dear colleague, you
                    did me the honor of writing to me, the 13th
                    of last, to ask me my relative opinion <!-- 'relativement' is split and hyphenated between 'relati-' and '-vement'. -->
                    on the acknowledgement of the Republic
                    of Liberia, who proclaimed its independence
                    in August 1847 and who was already recognized
                    by Great Britain and the United States
                    of America. You ask me at the same 
                    time if I <unclear>penne</unclear> that there could be reservations
                    to make for the isolated African village
                    in the territory of the new Republic
                    and that the chief submitted to France.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I appreciate like you the motives
                    that must determine you to follow the example <!-- 'l'exemple' is split and hyphenated between l'ex-' and '-emple'. -->
                    of England and the United States
                    in officially recognizing the independence <!-- 'l'indépen-' and '-dance' is split and hyphenated between 'l'indépen-' and '-dance' -->
                    of a new state that can become
                    at the same time a center of civilization for
                    this portion of Africa and a point
                    of interest for our commerce. I don't

                    to the commander of your Nation

                    the opposition of the chief of the village that refuses to 
                    submit to the government of Liberia <unclear>claims</unclear>
                    our protection merits bringing a serious
                    obstacle on our part to the recognition in
                    question. however, if it gives material to
                    some difficulty, we can hardly
                    refuse to intervene, at least as mediators,
                    and to prevent that it<unclear>amenât</unclear> a vexing conflict.

                <p>

                    of my highest consideration
