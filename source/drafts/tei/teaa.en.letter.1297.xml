<p>148 <gap/> CENTRAL AFRICAN COMMERCE AND TRANSVAAL TRADER. <gap/> October, 1900.</p>

<p>GERMAN SUBSIDISED STEAMERS
TO SOUTH AFRICA.</p>

<p>A copy has been received at the Foreign Office of a précis by the
Commercial Attaché of the British Embassy at Berlin of the explanatory
statement annexed to the German Bill regarding the
extension of the German subsidised steamers to South Africa. The
memorandum states that it is not intended to enter into direct
competition with the fast steamers of the Castle and Union lines,
but the intention is to place the German ships on a par with the
so-called "intermediate boats," which, on the West Coast of
Africa, travel at about eleven knots, and reach the Cape in twenty-two
days. A fortnightly service right round Africa will be
established, starting alternately to the east, through the Suez Canal,
and to the West by the Canary Islands. The ports called at will
be as follows:-</p>

<p>On the eastern voyage: Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Antwerp, Lisbon,
Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, Tanga, Zanzibar, Dar-es-Salaam,
Mozambique, Beira, Delagoa Bay, Durban, East London,
Port Elizabeth, Capetown, Las Palmas, Lisbon, Bremerhaven, and Hamburg.</p>

<p>On the western voyage: Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Amsterdam,
Lisbon, Las Palmas, Capetown, Port Elizabeth, East London,
Durban, Delagoa Bay, Beira, Mozambique Dar-es-Salaam, Zanzibar,
Tanga, Aden, Suez, Port Said, Naples, Lisbon, Rotterdam,
Bremerhaven, Hamburg.</p>

<p>It has been decided not to call at Swakopmund, in the German
South West African Protectorate, as it would be deviating from
the direct route. On the round voyages between Europe and the
Cape, the contract rate of speed is to be twelve knots, both for
ships already afloat, and for the new vessels still to be built for the
African services, when on the West Coast of Africa. The speed
in the East Coast will be the same between Napes and Dar-es-Salaam,
whereas, on other stretches, it is only to be ten and a half
knots, as at present. A branch line, with regular fortnightly
connections is to be established between the ports on the East Coast
of Africa and Hamburg, via the Suez Canal, as far as Beira. For
the carrying out of the above services, in the proposed extended
them, the East African line is to receive and Imperial subsidy of
<unclear>$67,500</unclear> per year, of £22,500 more than it now has under the
existing contract: the duration of the new agreement is to be for
fifteen years. The financial position of the East Africa line, in
spite of the subsidy of £45,000 a year, was by no means satisfactory
in the first years of its services to the East Coast of Africa. The
capital originally, was £300,000; there were large deficits for
several years, and in 1894 the capital was reduced to £250,000,
£50,000 being written off as lost capital. In 1895 there was no
deficit: in 1895 and 1896 6 per cent was paid; and in 1897 and
1898 3 per cent was received by the shareholders.</p>

<p>The future traffic requirements will be: the two large steamers
now ready, five new large steamers still need to be built at a cost of
£125,000 each, and four medium sized intermediate vessels costing
each £65,000</p>

<p>It is proposed that the new contract should come into force on
April 1, 1901.</p>

<p>PROPOSED NEW RAILWAS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</p>

<p>In the course of a most interesting letter to the Morning Post,
the Hon. Robert White deals with the present position of South
African railways and the lines on which future developments will
most probably take place. He gives a list of suggested new lines,
which is worthy of reproduction here. They are as follows:--
1. Harrismith to Bethlehem (fifty-five miles), thence to Heilbron.
As already mentioned, this line is partly commenced. It would
connect <unclear>Natal</unclear> with the Orange River Colony trunk railway, and
open up the grain district. 2. Vereeniging to Johannesburg direct
(thirty-five miles). 3. Kimberley to Bloemfontein (100 miles). 4.
Kimberley to SPringfontein, via Fauresmith and Jagersfontein (130
miles). 5. Winburg to Ficksburg and Harrismith (120 miles). Would
supply Bloomfontein, Kimberley, and the Transvaal from the grain
districts. 6. Aliwal North to Wepener, thence to Ladybrand, Ficksburg,
and Bethlehem (190 miles). Would run right through the rich
grain districts of the Orange River Colony. 7. Springs to Middelburg
(eighty miles). A very necessary line, as it runs through the
<unclear></unclear> coal districts, and could supply Johannesburg. 8. Klerksdorp
Fourteen Streams (150 miles). This is the old road from Kimberley
to Johannesburg, and would open up coal and gold districts. 9.
<unclear></unclear> Poort to Leydsdorp (150 miles). About seventy miles is already
laid (Sela Railway). 10. Pietersburg to the Gwanda Railway (250
miles). Would connect Johannesburg and the south directly with
<unclear></unclear> through the Transvaal.</p>

<p>AFRICAN PERSONALITIES.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Gilmore, of Wilson and Gilmore, Capetown, has concluded
his stay in England.</p>

<p>Mr. W. F. Leeson leaves very shortly for Durban in the interests
of the Natal-Zululand Railway.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Traill Anderson, chairman of the Kimberley Chamber of
Commerce, returned to the Cape of the 15th ult.</p>

<p>Mr. Abe Bailey, one of the most active of the Rand millionaires,
has been spending a brief holiday at the Hotel Majestic, Harrogate.</p>

<p>Mr. C. H. Perrott, of the famous Tenter Street firm, Perrott
and Perrott, has arrived at the Cape on an important business
tour.</p>

<p>Mr. J. S. Apsey, of Johannesburg, has returned to the Cape
preparatory to fresh enterprise in the wholesale import line at the
Rand.</p>

<p>Mr. J. L. De Jongh is in London. He is one of the most
indefatigable of the executive members of the Rand Chamber of
Mines.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Frank Brown, the newly-appointed Postmaster-General
of Natal, left London for Durban on the 15th ult. in the Dunvegan
Castle.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips will again represent the interests of the Namaqua
Copper Co. at the Cage next month. He sails in the Briton on the
20th inst.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Williams, of Tanganyika Concessions and Zambesia
Exploring fame, is back in town immensely the better for his holiday
in Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Lepper, editor of the TImes of Natal, is on a holiday
visit to London. Mr. C. Woodhead, editor of the Natal Mercury,
returns to Durban on the 20th inst. in the Briton.</p>

<p>Mr. Fritz Mosenthal, one of the principals of the great Algoa
Bay, East London, and Transvaal import firm (Messrs. Mosenthal
and Co.), returned to South Africa in the Scot on the 22nd ult.</p>

<p>Mr. E. T. Boxall, who represents Van Den Berghs, Ltd., at
the Cape, left thither on the 1st ult. in the Kinfauns Castle. He
will also represent C. Farre, Rheims, the big champagne firm.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Timmis, whos "Nas" food has been one of the main
constituents of "Tommy's" dietary throughout the campaign in
South Africa, left in the Scot on the 22nd ult. for Capetown.</p>

<p>Mr. Loubser, of the important wholesale house of Messrs. Hirsch,
Loubser, and Co., Algoa Bay and Johannesburg, has joined the
increasing rush of Anglo-African merchants returning to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>On his return to England from America, Mr. R. H. Henderson,
ex-Mayor of Kimberley and head of the large drapery firm there
which bears his name, lost very little time ere he sailed again for
South Africa. He booked by the Tantallon Castle on the 29th ult.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Eckstein, of "The Corner House," Johannesburg,
returned to the Cape in the Norman on the 8th ult. in the full
expectation that when he landed, as he would do on Tuesday last,
the war would be over, and his immediate return to the Rand possible.</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Markham, of the large Capetown and Johannesburg
firm of that name, left for South Africa by the Tantallon Castle
on the 29th ult. Mr. Edwin Greenacre, of Messrs. Harvey, Greenacre,
and Co., London, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, and Johannesburg, saild by the same mail-boat.</p>

<p>Mr. L. L. Michell, general manager of the Standard Bank of
South Africa, has come to England with some very important
suggestions regarding the financial future of South Africa. He is
practically the Cape Treasurer-General (Sir Gordon Sprigg's alter
ego), as regards the public finances of theh Cape Colony and Rhodesia.
His design for the new South African sovereigns to be minted at
Pretoria is an excellent one--the Queen's head on one side and the
arms of the four colonies quartered on the reverse.</p>

<p>Prominent figures in THrogmorton Street almost every day since
their arrival early last month have been Mr. Julius Jeppe and Mr.
"Cor" Rissik, of Johannesburg. The former is a member of a
famous, and let it be said very progressive, German family, the
heads of which were the founders of the important Johannesburg
suburb of Jeppestown. Always favourites on the Rand Stock
Exchange, Messrs. Jeppe and Rissik were very reluctantly
"Comandeered," but took the earliest opportunity of inviting the British
to arrest them as prisoners of war and place them on parole. They
hope soon to be back again on the Rand, where they will be certain
to work loyally under British rule.</p>

<p>Americans and Germans are already at work in South Africa;</p>
