<p>No.16...US Consular, Goree-Dakar
October 22nd, 1884


Mr. Peter Strickland
To the Department of State

Subject
Response to Circular
dated August 21st 1884, asking 
for information with a view
to the <unclear/> of the 
Consular Service</p>

<pb facs="20170619_133157"/>

<ab>No. 16 U.S Consulate, Goree Dakar
October 22nd 1884

To the Honorable John Davis
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington</ab>
    
<p>Sir:
By last mail I received a
Circular dated August 21st, 1884
requesting information with a 
view to the reargausation of the 
Consular service, I will then 
as briefly as may be, and of 
necessity in round roughly
estimated numbers, give you 
as graphic an idea as I can 
of French Senegal, its commercial
facilities and its possibilities.</p>

<p>Geographically,
French Senegal extends from 
the "Great Desert" to near Sierra
Leone, embracing a section of
Coast about six hundred
miles in length, for the most</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_133204"/>

<p>part extremely fertile, and 
abounding with navigable
Rivers which render access
to the interior comparatively
cheap and easy. Of these
the  Sebegal River is navigable
for 600 miles during half of the 
year, and is being connected
with the Niger bby a Railrad
from Bafavlake to Bammakou
which will give it the trade
of the whole upper Niger valley.
The other Rivers of importance
are the Salvum, the Casamausa
the Casaini, the Nuners, the Ponga,
the Debreeka, and the Mellancee;
all navigable for distances
ranging from 10 to 150 miles.--</p>

<p>Sandwhiched between the French 
sections of Coast are some
English Settlements confined
closely to the banks of the Gambia,
which is a magnificent River
vavigable for 400 miles, and 
some Portuguese settlements about</p>

<pb facs="20170619_133211"/>

<p>Bulama, where there are also 
three fine Rivers each navigable
far more than a hundred miles.
The Commerce of both the English 
and Portuguese possessions is 
essentially under French control,
and Goree, Dakar from its central
position and accessibility to mail
steamers is the Commercial
emporium of the whole coast.</p>

<p>Of cities+ towns,
St. Louis, built in handsome 
European style on an island in
the Senegal River, is the capitol,
with a large commerce, and 
contains with its <unclear/> about 
30,000 inhabitants. Goree-Dakar
with their envisions, including 
Rufisk in sight on the Game
Boy, contain fully 25,000
inhabitants, and there are 
numerous turns further South
in French Senegal which 
contain from one to five
thousand inhabitants, all</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_133218"/>

<p>doing a thriving trade with 
Goree, (which is a free port)
by means of Coaster ranging
from 10 to 150 tons, many of
them tindered with Mahogany
and rarewood which abounds
at different palces on the Coast.</p>

<p>The magnificent Bay of
Goree is 20 miles across from
East to West deep, forming 
one of the Gafest and most
Capacious harbors in the world.
It contains no detached changers
of consequencce, the navigation
being clean in all parts at 
the distance of a mile 
from the Shore; and in it 
no lasting gale even blows.
Of its present commerce +
have no statistics at hand
from which to infer the
amount, but have seen,</p>

<pb facs="20170619_133224"/>

<p>of which there are about 
always a number in port,
more than ten thousands tons
of shipping in the Bay at 
one time.</p>

<p>A Railroad,
was begun from taken last
year, and trains are now 
ruming over it into the 
interior upwards of 30 miles,
and it is designed next
year to have it extended
as far as St. Louis, more than 
a hundred miles. The telegraph
already connects the two pleaces,
which is to cummest by
Cable next year to the 
Canaries, and from thence
to Europe.</p>
    
<p>The Mails,
to Europe are carried by
the Steamers of the <unclear/>
+ Moritive Company, which 
are from three to four 
thousands tons each, and</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_133234"/>    
    
<p>in going and coming call at
Goree four times a month.
In addition to there we have 
a baot from the English line 
of steamers once a mouth, and 
one from a Ramburgh line 
of steamers once a month,
besides several belonging
to merchants vehicle sometimes
carry the mails best do not
make their trips regularly.</p>  

<p>Amount of American Trade
The Amount of American
Gouds at prevent consumed
yearly in French Senegal
Cannal amount to less than 
one Million dollars in value ,
but of this only about one 
fifth part is brought here
by Americans, who have been
steadily driven off by competition
because the conditions of the 
trade are against them.
French agents in Boston
and New York <unclear/> such</p>
    
<pb facs="20170619_133240"/>

<p>Goods only as can be obtained
an reasonable terms in America,
and either chip them direct
mostly in foreign vessels which 
afterwards load groundnuts
for Europe or else they ship
them to Europe by steam
from whence they are brought
clown here in vessels which 
carry on the Trade reguarly.</p>

<p>Owing to this state of affairs,
which in my opinion might
easily be prevented, our direct
commerce is not holding its
own in this one of the
fairest prospecture markets
in the world; there being 
not less than 3,000,000 of 
natives here noe fairly under
French jurisdiction, with 
wants which American
Caew supply better than 
others increasing in almost 
a <unclear/> rates, and good
produce to exchange for goods.</p>

<pb facs="20170619_133246"/>

<p>But I hope to explain 
fully about this in the 
near future, and will
now end by stating that
with the present depressing 
influences there will not
probably be expointed dusty
to America from Goree Dakar in 
more than $60,000 in Produce.
It will consist of hides, plum. 
Capol and Fudia Rubber,
and much of the same kinds
of produce vanish go from
here to Europe will finally 
reach America to pay for 
goods which French agents
buy and ships from there.</p>

<p>We foregoing remains
I hope will serve to give 
the Government a sufficient
Counsular service, but there
is much that would perhaps 
be more interesting to be</p>

<pb facs="20170619_133255"/>
    
<p>added as soon as some 
statistics will be available
at the conculsion of the current 
quarter. In brief it seems
to me that Goree- Dakar is 
one of the most important
places between Cape Spartel
and that of Good Hope.
Only that it has a somewhat
unsavory reputation on rcent 
of epedemics Dakar would soon
rival St. Dicante as a coaling 
station for steamers, and as 
things are it does a good 
deal of that business. There 
is unfortunately us question
but what the Coast of Africa
is unhealthy for Europeans, but 
Goree Dakar is one of the 
best places an it in that
respect-- probably the very 
best place.</p>   
    
<p>Of Governors, Senegal has
far a long time had Faidresube
one of the must distingushed</p>    
    
<pb facs="20170619_133301"/>    
   
<p>of her Generals and more 
recently Briere d'l l'Fole, at
present high in command
in Tangrin. Law the Colony 
would relish the American 
representation here changed
back to a vice consulate
as seen to be proposed I 
can only give form a long
knowledge of the French 
Charater, but I presume I 
shll not do wrong in
<unclear/> that I think such 
a measure would be hardly 
favorable to American interests
here, and perhaps course whoever
held the position to be treated
with a frigid <unclear/> by 
far from agreable.
I am sir with respect
Very truly Yours
Peter Strickland
US Consul
