<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir,
I have the honor to report any arrival
at this place March 22 at 6:30
p.m.</p>
    
<p>The next morning I called upon thr 
Hon. Edwin H. Terrell the United States
Minister and also upon M. George
W. Roosevelt United States Consul.</p>
    
<p>In the afternoon I called upon M.
Edward Van Eslvelde the Secretary
of the Interior of the Congo State
and also upon the Count de
Grelle. Roqier, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs of the Congo
and by back of these gentlemen
I was recieved in a must cordiel

manner</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_141007"/>
<p>manner.

They expressed themselves as 
being qualified at the United States
filing the vacancy caused by
M.Taunts death, and offered
me every facility for acquiring
information back here and in 
the Free State.</p>
    
<p>M. Van Eslvelde has received
orders for me to have any
vacant quarters in the Govern-
ment houses and also that
I be taken into one of the vessels
at Boma, until I can get my
own house and that the 
State Doelors attend me in case
of sickness.</p>
    
<p>The next day I recieved a 
notification from the Count de
Grelle. Roger that His Majesty
the King requested one to come to 
the Royal Palace at Brussels
Saturday afternoon at half 
after three.</p>
    
<p>I presented myself at the 

Palace</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_141023"/>
<p>Palace
at the appointed time and was
must cordially recieved by His
Majesty who office making com-
pliementary remarks regarding the 
United States (to which I replied
in a suitable manner I said he 
was pleased to see that a 
Bill had been introduced into 
the Senate making provision for 
a Consul General and Vice
Consul in the Congo. He asked
me if + thought it would 
become a law to which I 
replied that it was impos-
sible to say.</p>
    
<p>He said every facility would 
be given me owed he hoped
that my visit to the state
would be productive of 
good results to its com-
merce.</p>
    
<p>The audience lasted nearly
an hour and in that timee
I became thoroughly impressed

by</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_141036"/>
<p>by 
the fact that His Majesty was
perfectly familiar with every
detail of the workings of the 
Government of the Congo State.
It is stated here in Brussels
that no move is ever taken
without his knowledge and 
consent.

I am Sir,
Very Respectfully
Your obident Servant
R.Dorsey Mohew
Commercial Agent</p>
