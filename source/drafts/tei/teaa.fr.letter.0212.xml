<p>Consulat Général
De
L'État Indépendant Du Congo,
Baltimore.</p>

<p>Confidential.</p>
    
<p>Memorandum on Clarence Rice Slocum,
American Consul General to the Congo Free State.</p>
    
<p>He is the youngest of the late General Henry Warner Slocum,
about 35 years old, married (his wife is, I think, of Swedish 
descent) and is said to be a manly, straightforward fellow, absolutely
honest and fearless. I have just been talking about him with
a friend of mine who was an old comrade of the General's and who
knows all of the family very well. The General graduated at the
United States Military Academy at West Point, left the army to
practice law, but returned to the army on the outbreak of the
Civil War in which he served with distinction. He afterwards was
elected to Congress as a Democrat (about 1868 or 1870) and
served in Congress several terms.</p>
    
<p>The General and his family lived in Brooklyn, N.Y., and went
to the Congregational Church there but do not seem to have had any
fanatical tendencies. Bridgman used to attend the same church and
he is going to get me some additional information in a day or two.</p>
    
<p>Clarence Rice Slocum was appointed Consul at Warsaw in 1903
and transferred as Consul to Weimar March 8th 1905 I do not think
he was engaged in any profession before that time, but,
having inherited a rather large fortune from his father, went into
several enterprises in which he is supposed to have lost money.
He has a brother who is a stock-broker in New York, Henry W. Slocum;
and a sister married to Kingsbury of the United States Army who
has been living in Washington. She is now on a visit to her
brother at Weimar, having sailed a week ago.</p>
    
<p>I will enquire more about him from Mr. Carr, Chief of the
Consular Bureau of the Department of State, and when the Senator
gets back to Washington (Wednesday or Thursday) I hope to get
also a confidential report from "an authoritative source".</p>

<p>As Slocum and I have a number of mutual friends I shall try
to arrange to met him on a friendly basis while in Europe next 
month.</p>
