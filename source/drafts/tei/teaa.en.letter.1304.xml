<p>2 <gap/> THE LIBERIA RECORDER.</p>

<p>Associate Justice Dossen's
speech delivered before His
Excellency the President in
behalf of the Supreme Court
of this Republic at the opening
of its Annual Sessions.</p>

<p>Mr. President:--The mighty wheel of time
has moved steadily onward and in its revolution,
has brought around again the time fixed
by the laws of this Republic, for the Annual
session of the Supreme Court of Liberia, which
we have the distinguished honor to represent.</p>

<p>It is to us a cause for unfeigned thanks to the
great Disposer of all things, that this ARM of
State, which is the highest expounder of the
laws under which we live; the guardian of the
civil and religious rights and liberties of this
people and the source from whence flows a
pure, unpolluted stream of Justice and Equity,
has been preserved through all the vicissitudes
of the past year, and that  we are today sound
in limb and mind and able to enter upon the
discharge of those grave and solemn duties
imposed upon us by law.</p>

<p>It is also a source of gratification to us, that
we find Your Excellency in the enjoyment of
health and surrounded by the most cheering
prospects, of a grand and prosperous future, in
the new position, which by operation of law,
you are called upon to fill.</p>

<p>In keeping with a time-honored custom of
this Tribunal, we are here, sir, to pay you officially,
our respects and to pledge you the warm,
unflinching support and earnest co-opperation
of this branch of the Government, in every
wise and legitimate measure of Your Excellency's
administration.</p>

<p>We wish here to assure Your Excellency, that
we highly appreciate the patriotism which
influenced you to accept the high office you now
fill, as the first citizen of your country, under
circumstances so unique in the history of this
Republic-Circumstances, which have
convulsed and revolutionized nations far greater
than this, and with centuries of growth and
civilization behind them. We take it as indicative
of the political genius, skill, patriotism and
predisposition of the people of Liberia to good
order,--(which, we would remark, is a cogent
reputation of the unfounded theory touching
the Negro's unfitness for self-government) that
the dangerous chasm which lately happened in
our national life, was safely bridged, without
producing any of those civil catastrophes,
which have in the past, over taken other countries,
passing through a similar ordeal.</p>

<p>To be the President of the Republic of Liberia;
to direct the destinies of the people, whom
ROBERTS, BENSON, and others ruled and
covered with renown; to see that no evil befall
this sacred heritage bequeathed unto us by the
immortal fathers--a heritage made dear to us
by their toils and their blood,--this is no light
task. He must study the welfare of the whole
common-wealth without respect to rank or
condition. He must thoroughly recognize his
responsibility to the people whom he would
successfully serve and seek to discharge that
responsibility in every wise and legitimate way.
He must place himself in touch of leading and
popular thoughts and march to the music of a
brilliant future.</p>

<p>The people in their majesty, through the
operation of laws made by their lawful
representatives, having selected you to be the standard-bearer
of this nation, we believe, that the
act has the approval of God; and that relying
upon the wisdom and power of Him who rules</p>

<p>the unverse, you shall not only succeed in
keeping in tact all that has been committed to
your trust, but that you will be instrumental
in leading forth this Republic to greater glory
and brighter renown.</p>

<p>We believe, sir, that the country can rely
with safety and composure, upon your broad
wisdom, sound, statesmanlike judgment and
unflinching devotion to duty;--already demonstrated
by a long and brilliant career in the
service of your country, to guard with vigil
watchfulness the rights and liberties of this
people; to represent their claims before the
cabinets of the civilized world; to promote the
happiness,.peace and prosperity of both citizen
and foreigner and to maintain for us, that civil
recognition and relgious freedom, which the
sleeping SIres of this rising Republic, laboured,
bled and died to secure to us and to our posterity.</p>

<p>On behalf of the JUDICIARY of the Republic
of Liberia, we congratulate Your Excellency,
and we wish you a long and a useful life, good
health and signal prosperity. We trust, sir,
that the happy relatious which have always
existed between the Executive and Judiciary
Branches of the Government may continue
uninterrupted for all future.</p>

<p>The Liberia Recorder,
Monrovia, Thursday, Feb. 28, 1901.</p>

<p>The Close of our third Year.</p>

<p>To-day marks the completion of our third
year in the field of Liberian journalism, which
after all said and done, is a most trying and
difficult one.</p>

<p>Many of our readers, no doubt will be anxious
to know whether this issue may not be regarded
as the last toll of our death knell declaring
the curtain dropt over us, and placing them
under the painful necessity of tracing our
vestiges along a beaten track, where their last
traces may have been obliterated, and their final
sounds long hushed in the distant air. To
this we answer, no. This issue leaves us a living
entity in the field of journalism.</p>

<p>The duty of a public journalist especially in
a community like ours is quite a thankless one.</p>

<p>During this short period of our existence
we have been called upon to steer into and
encounter fruitful sources of temptation and
alluring tendencies,-shoals and sand banks to
which a journal managed and controled by
young and in experienced men must be
exposed, and upon which many older and more
experienced journalists have too often become
stranded and floundered, thereby failing to be
any longer a faithful exponent of public opinion
or a true fidei defensor of the constitutional
rights and privileges of the people.</p>

<p>Whether we have avoided these shoals and
sand banks is a question which we leave entirely
with our readers to decide.</p>

<p>As journalists we are aware that we have not
pleased all parties, nor aided out all nations,
whether they be political, social, religious, racial
or otherwise, and that amidst well defined
policies many to whose personal wishes we did
not pander found room to impute base and
unworthy motives.</p>

<p>During this our journalistic year which is
now at its close, our working expenses have
been a little increased and our returns though</p>

<p>far from being as we should have wished them,
have on the whole been satisfactory.</p>

<p>In a Leader of our issue of Oct. 12, 1899, we
said, "There are a good many readers of the
RECORDER who have got into the shameful
habit of going about borrowing the paper from
those who had t satisfy the Editor before they
could get them to read."</p>

<p>This practice if discouraged by our subscribers
would materially assist us, because by such
discouragement we shall have the opportunity
of adding many more names to our list of our
subscribers at the commencement of our fourth
volume from the ranks of those who read but do not subscribe.</p>

<p>In closing this our third volume we have to
express to our subscribers, literary contributors,
both at home and abroad, and to all who
have directly or indirectly aided us heartfelt
thanks and gratitude and humbly request their
continued support and encouragement during
the ensuing year.</p>

<p>We also record our appreciations of the good
feelings and amicable relations which have
existed between our local contemporaries, the
Baptist Monitor, the Cape Palmas Reporter, the
New Africa and ourselves--feelings and relations
which cannot but have a salutary effect up
on journalism in Liberia. Each journal furnishing
materials, in its own way, and instilling
principles on which to build up a strong
national fabric with a healthy public opinion which
till now may be considered as in its embryo.</p>

<p>As our next volume will be opened by a
new Editor we cannot outline a policy which
will be pursued during the ensuing year, but
we are sure, however, that schemes will be
developed which will encourage a greater interest
in the LIBERIA RECORDER to such an extent
that in every house where there is an intelligent
reader a copy of this paper will find and
enterance.</p>

<p>Our collector will wait on our local subscribers
for the renewal of their subscriptions and
we trust that he will be pleasantly received and
his requests be attended to.</p>

<p>Not easy for a President.</p>

<p>In the space of a short article it would be
impossible to enumerate the many grave
responsibilities resting upon the President, all of
which require extraordinary ability. Consider
his legislative functions only. He is required
to approve every law passed by the Legislature,
or to return it without his signature--but that
seldom occurs.</p>

<p>The President, generally, has fixed and intelligent
ideas on all subjects of legislation, and
either approves or vetoes. As an executive
officer, he has to administer every department of
the Government; to conduct our foreign relations;
to carry on war and to conserve peace;
to collect and discharge the revenues; to supervise
the administration of Justice; to carry on
the mail service, both domestic and foreign;
to execute the laws relating to the Aboriginees,
public lands, mines patents, and an infinite
variety of other subjects; to govern the Interior;
and to make treaties. In the performance of
the last named duty, he is guided by the advice
and consent of the Senate.</p>

<p>Waiving all the thoughts of these numerous
and onerous executive functions, which, in
themselves call for superior ability, he must,
as above stated, devote much time and ability
to legislation.</p>

<p>The veto power was placed in his hand as
a great perogative to insure the independence
of the Executive. By it alone can the executive</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3201.jpg"/>

<p><gap/>THE LIBERIA RECORDER. <gap/>3</p>

<p>office itself and the rights of the people be
protected from encroachments upon the part of
the legislature and judicial branches of the
government. It is a very great power, and,
by most of the PResidents, has been very sparingly
used; yet, without its sagacious and
intelligent exercise form of government would be
a sad failure. This signal prerogative on the
part of the PResident calls for very great ability
and discretion. The power of the veto cannot
be entrusted to an inferior, ignorant or capricious
man, nor to one who has not carefully
studied the history and government of the
country at large.</p>

<p>Therefore in our selections of candidates for
the Presidency and Vice our leaders should
have an eyesingle in these directions.</p>

<p><add>x</add>The Manoah River Question.<add>x</add></p>

<p>There is a matter of vital importance in
connection with our relations with Great Britain,
which we would like to call the Executive
Government's immediate attention to, with the
view of their opening correspondence with His
Majesty's Government relative to the settlement
thereof; provided if such steps have not
already been taken. We refer to the propriety
of allowing the citizens of the Republic equal
right to the free navigation of the Manoh River;
which right is at present denied, based upon
the second article of the Convention concluded
between Great Britain and Liberia at Freetown,
Sierra Leone, on the eleventh day of November
A. D. 1885, by Sir Samuel Rowe, K.C.M.G.,
Governor and Commander-in-chief of Sierra
Leone and H. B. M.'s Consul for Liberia, representing
Great Britain, and the Honorables
Henry W. Grimes and Benjamin Anderson in
behalf of the PResident of the Republic of Liberia,
which article reads as follows:</p>

<p>"The line marking the North Western boundary
of the Republic of Liberia shall commence
at the point on the sea coast at which at low
water, the line of the South Western or left
bank of the Manoh River intersects the general
line of the sea coast and shall be continued
along the line marked by low water on the
South Western or left bank of the Manoh River
until such line or such line prolonged in a
North Easterly direction intersects the line or
the prolongation of the line marking the north
eastern or inland boundary of the territories of
the Republic, within Liberian Territory the
Town or Bopora and such other towns as shall
be hereafter acknowledged to have belonged to
the Republic at the time of signing of this
Convention."</p>

<p>From the above article it is easily seen that
instead of the Manoh River itself marking the
North Western boundary of this Republic it is
the left bank of said River at low water which
intersects the general line of the sea coast.</p>

<p>Now, article third which describes Great
Britain's boundary reads also as follows.</p>

<p>"The President of the Republic of Liberia
hereby recognizes the recent acquisition by Her
Majesty's Government of certain portions of
territory which makes the South Eastern boundary
of Her Majesty's possessions in this portion
of the line of the north western boundary of
the Republic of Liberia as described in article
II, which commences at the point on the sea
coast at which at low water the line of the South
Western or left bank of the Mannoh River
intersects the general line of the sea coast and
which terminates at the point on the line of the
said North Western boundary line nearest to the
town of Ngaringa situated on the right bank of
the Manoh River."</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that this article concedes
to Great Britain the entire river, which if had
been wonded thus, "The President of the
Republic of Liberia hereby recognizes the recent
acquisition by Her Majesty's Government of
certain portions of territory which mark the
South Eastern boundary of Her Majesty's
posessions in this portion of West Africa the
boundary of which commences at the point on the
sea coast at which at low water the line of the
South Eastern or right bank of the Manoh
River intersects the general line of the sea
coast" etc. etc., the River, then not being included
within the territorial limits of either government
its navigation would have unquestionably
been free and opened to the subjects and citizens
of both governments, as it is a well settled
principle of International Law, that the boundary
which divides two seperate states is neutral
ground and is accessable as a common highway
between the citizens of both states.</p>

<p>There is no concealing of the fact that the
failure on the part of the Special Commissioners
of the Government to obtain from the British
Government reciprocal rights for the use of the
Manoh River was a serious oversight and omission;
the effects of which largely hamper and
retard the commercial intersts of the Republic.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the trade in that
particular section of the country is on our side of
the river a great distance up, and our merchants
at Cape Mount not being allowed the
right of navigation on said river can only get
their goods and produce to and fro over-land
with the assistance of carriers; which means to
them an enormous outlay of money and a most
unprofitable business, besides a great waste of
time; whereas the English merchant who has
the free use of the river can easily convey to
and from said point 10 and 20 tons of cargo in
a less time and at less expense, by means of
a boat or vessel, than the Liberian merchant,
who would have to employ not less than 500 to
1000 carriers to convey the same quantity of
goods to said point.</p>

<p>Just a month ago a Liberian trader by the
name of Hoff was seized by the English authorities
on the other side of the River for attempting
to navigate said River for the purpose of
trade, but has since been released, as we are
informe,d under a strong reprimand. We are
however of the opinion that it si not the intention
of Great Britain to knowlingly take any
undrue advantage of this Republic directly or
indirectly, and the attitude assumed by the British
Government towards Liberia in all matters
pertaining to her interests and welfare, heretofore,
points in this direction.</p>
