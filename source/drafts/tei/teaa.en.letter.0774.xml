<p>Mr Peter Strickland<lb/>
To the Department of State</p>

<p>Subject</p>

<p>Augmentation of
the Customs duties for the
Colony of Senegal, with some
of the alleged reasons therefor.
Regular and direct Steam
Communication one of the necessities
for the continuance and healthy
development of an American
Commerce.</p>

<note>Number 129</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate Goree-Dakar<lb/>
February 3d 1891</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
William F Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to bring 
to your notice that on the
first day of this current year
a new schedule of duties began 
to take effect in this Colony
some of the provisions of
which are not favorable to
foreigners.</p>

<p>Previous to January 1st
of this year, the duties levied
on most articles of merchandise,
foreign and French alike, were
at the rate of 5% ad valorem,
the value not always being estimated
from Invoices, but according
to a "Mercuriale" periodically
fixed by a Commission appointed
for the purpose. This rate of
5% still applies to articles

<pb facs="20170619_150642"/>

of French production, whether
manufactured or otherwise, but
seven per cent additional is
now levied on most articles of
foreign production.</p>

<p>There are a few articles the 
duties on which are arranged
in a manner something different
and leaf Tobacco is one. The
duty on this article has been
raised from 15 centimes a kilo
to 45 centimes per kilo, and in
anticipation of this great change
those merchants here who could
supplied themselves largely from
Europe during November &amp; December
thus <unclear>saving</unclear> to themselves for months
to come the augmentation of duty.</p>

<p>Another Article which does
not come under the first-mentioned
arrangement is a kind of blue
cotton fabric called "Guinea", of
which enormous quantities are used
in Africa. This has been produced
hitherto in England and in Belgium
and is an important branch of
industry in both those countries.
<unclear>On this</unclear> The new duties seem quite <unclear>prohibited</unclear>

<pb facs="20170619_150703"/>

Two and a half centimes only per metre
are to be levied on "Guinea" if of French
manufacture, but thirty-one centimes
per metre if of foreign manufacture.</p>

<p>The manufacture of this article has
been attempted lately in America, but
without success, because the imitation
was imperfect. The new duty will
of course prevent further attempts in
this direction.</p>

<p>The duties on other articles not
included in the seven per cent
schedule, (twelve per cent altogether,) are
as follows: Munitions of war. 
15%: Cola nuts 50 centimes per kilo</p>

<p>Enclosed will be found a 
copy of the "Mercuriale" for the first
half of this year, with prices annexed
to each article on which the per
centage of duties will be levied.</p>

<p>That the new duties, especially if
they are continued long without modification
will somewhat injure the rapidly growing
American trade in this Colony there
can be no doubt. Some articles have
been introduced against much prejudice
and opposition, but have steadily won
their way into favor in spite of all: a

<pb facs="20170619_150709"/>

difference of seven per cent in price
against many of them however could
not at present be borne, and such 
articles will undoubtedly be pretty much
with-held from this market. But 
articles which France does not produce
must after present stocks get reduced
commence to come again, though less
by the direct route and in somewhat
reduced quantities. It is the natives
of course who will have to pay
the extra-laid duties, and their
purchasing capacity will be diminished
nearly to the amount of the extra
duties, hence the less quantity that
will of necessity be imported. And 
the withdrawal of freight from the
small sailing vessels which now come
direct must cause some of them
to be withdrawn from the business
and so diminish the number of <unclear>trips.</unclear>
Sudden calls for limited quantities of
merchandise which represent value
like leaf tobacco will then have to
be met by the expensive steam-route
via Liverpool, thus throwing a large
share of the carrying trade here that
will be left into the hands of foreign shipowners

<pb facs="20170619_150714"/>

To illustrate exactly how the new 
duties are likely to affect Americans,
we will take the case of two vessels
which arrived in this Colony in November
last, the Frank M Howes of 169 tons with
about 100 <unclear extent="one word"/> of Hard-pine lumber from
Fernandinha, Fla. and the Kochees of
353 tons from New York, with 1275 <unclear extent="one word"/>
of Flour, 996 of Bread, 500 <unclear extent="one word"/> of
Cotton-Seed Oil, and 100/2 (half) <unclear extent="one word"/>
of tobacco, with some other articles
not necessary to mention the quantity
of each being small. The new
duties would not have prevented the
voyage of the Frank M. Howes, because
hard-pine lumber is not produced in
France, but Flour, Bread &amp; Oil which
constituted the bulk of the cargo of the
Kochees are staples of that country
almost as much as they are of ours,
and a discriminating duty of seven
per cent against them would have
been fatal to the voyage of the Kochees,
whose tobacco might have come by
steam via Liverpool, at more expense
to be sure, but then the Kochees could
not have earned a freight with the
tobacco alone.</p>

<pb facs="20170619_150720"/>

<p>Some of the causes which have
induced the French Government to
impose discriminating duties against
foreign productions are not far
to seek. It has at great trouble
and expense established a respect
for order among the natives, so 
that life and property are <unclear extent="one word"/>
as safe here now as in any country
It has assisted in building a
railroad connected the Colony
with the outside world by cable
afforded excellent mail and
commercial facilities, but the
commerce developed does not 
<unclear>inure</unclear> as it seemingly should
for the benefit of France. The
oleaginous products of the county
are mostly exported to France, but
the French have to pay money
for them, while this money is
used in purchasing goods procured
in the first place from foreigners.
England has hitherto furnished <unclear>most</unclear>
of the cotton fabrics for the <unclear>principal</unclear>
reason that Manchester Manufacturers
will cater to every whim and prejudice
of the natives while French and American

<pb facs="20170619_150726"/>

<sic>manfacturers</sic> will not. Germany has at
present a monopoly of the liquor traffic, and
American since she lost that has been
making up in many other directions. The
French are simply maneuvering for what
they consider a fair share of the trade
of their own Colony, and propose to exact
tribute of all competitors until this is
accomplished. It is rumored here indeed
that the new arrangement may not be of
long continuance, but however this shall
prove it is certain I think to endure
long enough to greatly modify the
conditions of trade now existing between
this country and the United States.</p>

<p>Regular and direct steam
communication with New York would
go far I think to overcome the discriminating
duty of 7% which Americans would
keenly feel on some articles now exported
here by them at great expense for freight
and commissions. If such a line
could once be stimulated into existence
it would speedily engross all the
freight which now comes this way, either
direct or otherwise: and through the 
efforts of the American Commercial Traveller,
the Goods of every American Manufacturer

<pb facs="20170619_150732"/>

would be presented here at their best
without the favor of and without
paying a profit of perhaps more than
seven per cent to other less interested
middlemen.</p>

<p>It is said by the Colonists that
Americans might situate themselves
so as to feel the discriminating duties
less perhaps than other foreigners
and this seems to me true. The great
American staples of Lumber, Petroleum,
Cotton Cards, Tobacco and cheap Furniture
will not be seriously affected by the
change, and regular Steam Communication
by enabling Flour to be sold in small
fresh lots previous to arrival, thus saving
handling and storage expenses would
admit this and many other articles
in spite of the present duty, which
could not be the case with Guinea
and many valued articles exported
here by other foreigners, because their Good
have come here under the best
conditions possible for many years</p>

<p>Within the last few years I have
been besieged with letters from American
Manufacturers prospecting for an outlet
for their Goods, but I have been

<pb facs="20170619_150737"/>

obliged to reply that owing to the
lack of regular and direct steam communication
commercial transactions, the same as have
for a long time existed between European
manufacturers and dealers here, are quite
impracticable. The expenses of double freight
and transhipment in Liverpool I have
seen proof would kill any extensive
trade attempted in that way.</p>

<p>But in this connection I am
only mentioning the desirability of
regular and direct steam communication
as a means of overcoming the present
strained condition of trade. It is 
also desirable on other grounds which
I propose to treat of fully in a later Dispatch.</p>

<p>Concerning the policy of the French
Government in imposing discriminating
duties on the Goods of foreigners because
they have obtained control of certain parts
of the African Coast, and the probability
that this <unclear extent="one word"/> may be imitated by other
European nations among which the
greater part of this immense continent
is now divided up, it would seem
that it can hardly be a matter of 
indifference to Americans how matters

<pb facs="20170619_150744"/>

are being manipulated here in the 
interests of European claimants.</p>

<p>If American as well as Europe already
excels in her manufacturing industries,
and the tendency in manufacturing is
ever toward over-production, does it 
not follow that America as well as
Europe will soon need the most <unclear>extensive</unclear>>
outlets possible or her manufactured
Goods: but how can she long have
them or Commerce either if claims in
regard to distant new countries are <unclear extent="one word"/>
which might make trade with them
products not peculiarly American <unclear extent="one word"/>
nigh impossible?</p>

<p>These outlets for obvious reasons it <unclear>would</unclear>
seem should be sought most among people
who will not thus manufacture for ages to
come. Africa, which might take three <unclear extent="one word">countries</unclear>
like the United States within its borders <unclear>and</unclear>
have room for France thrown in, seems
much too large a country of the desirable
kind to be altogether blinked from our
commercial horizon.</p>
