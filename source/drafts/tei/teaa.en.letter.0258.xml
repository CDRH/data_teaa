Consulate of the United States of America at Sierra Leone 
March 20th 1863

Sir

I have the honor to request that this office may be supplie with the usual Consular blanks and official depatch paper as I am entirely out of them and they cannot be obtained in this colony.

I beg further to say that as considerable business i done in this office great inconvenience is experienced from the want of the regular consular books, real and press, the last administration having neglected to supply them at the time of my appointment.

I therefore beg to request that they may be supplied to this office. 

Opportunities of forwarding packages to this colony over frequently

Henry Rider
