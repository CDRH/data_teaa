<p>U.S. Consulate at
Sierra Leone<lb/>
March 15th 1880.</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst Secty of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the
honor to write you regarding
many new articles of American
Manufacture which have been
imported from the United States
to this place by the American
House of Yates and Porterfield
during the past year.</p>

<p>These articles find a ready sale
many of them being superior to
other make and are sought
after in preference.</p>

<p>American Axes, Hatchets,
Hammers, Saws, Hoes, <sic>Chissels</sic>
Augers &amp; Bits Cooking Stoves
Kerosene Oil Stoves, Nails,
Safes, Sewing Machines

<pb n="438"/>

and Hardware generally
Roofing Slates. other countries
cannot compete either in quality
or price. <unclear>Powder</unclear> being put
up in handsome varnished kegs
is superior in appearance
and strength. The only objection
urged against American <unclear>Powder</unclear>
is, it is not put in 4lb Kegs
as well as 5lb, and dealers claim
that a 4lb keg will sell for the
same as a 5lb keg, hence
the advantage of other packages
as against the American
The same objection is urged
against American <sic>Calcoes</sic>
and Cotton goods. The English
cottons are put up in pieces
of 12 and 20 yds and sell for
so much the piece whereas the
American Cottons as a rule
are in pieces ranging from
40 to 50 yards.</p>

<p>12 yards  of cloth cut off a
large piece is not as good

<pb n="439"/>

for this market, as a piece
regularly made up containing
just 12 yards. This seems
like a very slight affair, but
it is a most serious objetion
in the way of an easy introduction
of American cottons.</p>

<p>All the Pine Lumber used in
the Colony is imported from the
United States</p>

<p>American Trunks (cheap grade)
have a large and steadily
increasing sale.</p>

<p>All <sic>provissions</sic> (imported) <unclear extent="one word" reason="illegible"/>
Rice come from the states
Hats, Books and Shoes,
Chairs, Tables, and Furniture
generally, Scales, Soaps both
Toilet and Common, Perfumery
Clocks, Patent Stencil Plates
Telephones, Grind Stones
Canned goods all kinds
Needhams Musical Cabinet
Illustrated Bibles, Steel Engravings
Street Lamps making their own

gas from <sic>Naptha</sic>, Baskets
Stylographic pens and a
great many small articles
too numerous to specify.</p>

<p>Many of the above
articles have been introduced
through the influence of the
representations as made in
the "Scientific American" and
the "American Exporter" both
of said Journals being
received regularly at this
Consulate</p>
