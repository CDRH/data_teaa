<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
FEB 21 1888
RECEIVED</p>

<p>No. 3.</p>

<p>U. S. Legation
Monrovia, Liberia,
January 17th 1888.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your communication
No 9 Diplomatic Series
of December 9th 1887, with seven
enclosures.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in reporting that
I have in accordance with your
instruction delivered in perons
Mr Ecclaston and Bishop Penick's
letters to Mr Barlay Secretary
of State of Liberia, and expressed
<unclear>loyalty</unclear>my personal satisfaction
that this incident was at an end,
which was reciprocated by Sec'y
Barclay. The copy enclosures
I have on file in this Legation.</p>

<p>Refering to my No 2 of the
23rd sell., I have the honor to state
that Mr. Taylor saw fit to have
me in charge of this Legation
in the capacity of Acting Vice</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1248.jpg"/>

<p>Vice Consul General, to be appointed
Vice Consul General immediately
after his arrival to Liberia:
since his departure, I have
heard (unofficially) of his resignation
of the position of Minsiter
Resident and Consul General to
Liberia:. hence I have pleasure
in transmitting to you my Bond,
which I trust will meet your
approval.</p>

<p>Referring to Mr. Taylor's No 10
of 20th September last, in which
he stated, "A Bond <unclear>awaiteth</unclear>
nothing in this Country (Liberia)
so far as the United States
is censored," I have for
my Bondmen the chieves of the
most wealthy mercantile business
houses in the County, General
R. A. Sherman, and the H. J.
Moore, (the later of the firm of Moore
G. Moore Gen.) both of whom
are <unclear>venoun</unclear> to have capital
in the United States and of good</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1249.jpg"/>

<p>good reputation.</p>

<p>I am at present unaware
of my real position, and what
source to person in the management
of this Legation.</p>

<p>Awaiting your instructions
I am,
Sir,
Your Obedient Servant</p>

<p>Beverly Y. Payne</p>

<p>Hon.
T. F. Bayard
Secretary of State</p>

<p>Enclosure,
1 Bond</p>
