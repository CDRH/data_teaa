<p>Mr. J. H. Smyth to the<lb/>

<p>No. 73.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia, La, May 13, 1881.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you that in keeping with your despatch of instruction, dated March 12, 1881, I communicated with Mr. Williams as to the discontinuance of the Commercial Agency, at Grand Bassa, and the creation of a Consular Agency.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May 1881, I received from Mr. W. two notes, dated severally April 28, 1881; one advising me that he had been directed to inform me of the action of the Department in abolishing the Commercial <catchwords>Agency</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon. W. Hunter,<lb/>

Agency, and the other containing a tender of his resignation, with request that his successor be named at an early day together with desire that his bond be returned him.</p>

<p>In view of what yours of March 12th contained as to the matter of not reporting fees, and information in communication from the Superintendent of Grand Bassa as to the falsity of Mr. W's statement as to the jail and deserting sailors of the 'Jamie R. Deverty'; I accepted his resignation, and told him I would request his bond of the Department, and forward it as soon as received. I have already written Hon. Jno. W. Worrell, state senator, resident at Grand Bassa, a lawyer of high standing, and have tendered him the office of Consular Agent.</p> 

<p><catchwords>With</catchwords>

With renewed assurances of highest esteem,</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>

U.S. Consul General.</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Circular as to consular and diplomatic appropriations, received.</p>
