United States Commercial 
Agency at Gaboon
November 10th 1896 

Hon. John. L. Cadvalader
Assistant Secretary of State 
Washington D.C.

Sir;

<p></p>I have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of your dispatch No 46,
hearing date August 17th 1876,
It was not received at this office, 
till mondau October 30th.

<p></p>I regret exceedingly, the action of 
Congress, that has rendered it 
necessary to discontinue the office 
of Commercial Agent at Gaboon.
The removal of our flag- proud 
symbol of liberity + right-before 
Gaboon, where it has so long 
floated. will be prejudical
to American Commerce and 
especially to the philanthropic
and Christianizing enterprise 
of the America Mission which 
extends about 100 miles both north. 

and 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0176.002"
and South of Gaboon; and nearly 
200 miles into the interior of Africa. 
With sadness I hasten to comply 
with your instruction to close the 
office and render final accounts,
resewing for another dispatch, a 
request, which M.J.H. Reading and 
myself purpose to make to the 
Department, that we be permitted to retain 
the archives, and resume the function
of the Commercial Agency, receiving 
only the Fees for our services.

<p></p>The last mail, I transmitted my return 
and accounts for the Quarter ending 
September 20th, but drew no drafts 
for salary or other expenses. A new 
salary Account, will be forwarded 
to the Fifth Auditory of the Treasury.

<p></p>My salary from July 1st, to September 
20th amounts $220.10. Since July 1st.
I have received from this as already 
returned $21.96. Deducting this amount 
and also $20.00 "extra wages" on hands 
from the salary credit; there remain 
$178.16; for which amount I have 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0176.003"
drawn a draft upon the Monetary 
of the Treasury.

<p></p>During the period of my service 
as Commercial Agent, i have presented 
no account for rent, and 
miscelllaneous  expenses; as my predecesors 
in the office, were accounted 
ti di; and haave now none to render.
The archives are safely kept in 
an iron house. and as soon as my 
health will permit, I will take a careful 
inventory, of them, and sent a 
copy to the department of State per
mail.

<p></p>The earliest safe, and direct opportunity 
to send the archives to the 
United States, will be several months 
hences; and in the mean time,
we hope to receive permission to 
retain them, and continue the 
Agency. 

In reference to my return to the
United States; for which provision
has been made to continue the 
salary for 35 days, during the

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0176.004"

time of transit, hence to the 
United States; I am sorry to inform
you, that my medical advisor - 
under whose care I have been 
dawning the last two months decided 
against my leaving at present.
I have already requested of the 
Department, leave of absence early 
next year; + stil hope I maybe 
able to leave by that times + should 
the provision referred to be extended 
till that time, I shall be glad to 
avail myself of it. 

<p></p>I have now completed a third of a 
century of toils+ sacrifice in Western 
Africa in philanthropies + christian 
work- the abolition of the Slave
trade + the introduction of Christian
Civilization into this dark land. 
My life has been almost
miraculously present , + now I 
heluis I remain alone, the only 
white man on the coast who was 
here 33 years ago, when I arrived.
During this period to have been 

encouraging 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0176.005"

encouraging to write the subtle 
time of comerce in the Slave 
Trade, the rapid exploration 
of the country is the introdution 
of christian civilization with its 
incetionable blessings.

<p></p>Permit one to express my thanks 
to the offices of the Department 
of State, for their country to one 
during the period I have held the 
Commercial Agency.

<p></p>Should my health be restored,
by a brief visit to the United States;
I hope to return and resume my 
labors here; and we trust on mission 
house will continue to be a refuge 
for every American citizen who may 
visit the Gaboon; whether we have 
the right to render official assistance 
as such.

With great respect,
Sir, 
I remain, 
Your obedient Servant 
Albert Bushwell
U.S.C.Agent
