<p>The United States and Liberia
    Letter from Commodore</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>The following interesting letter from Commodore Shufeldt is cal-
   culated to awaken national interest to the importance of protecting
   Liberia in all her rights and liberties, and of strengthening her by in-
   telligent and well-appointed emigrants with the powerful aids of civil-
   ization.</p>

<p>Washington, D.C. April 6, 1881.
    William Coppinger, Esq., Secretary American Colonization Society,
        Dear Sir:-I regret that other engagements prevent my participa-
    in your public meeting to be held in new York in behalf of the
    interests of the Republic of Liberia.</p>

<p>     In view of the many failures which have been recorded in every
    age of the world, that colony may be regarded as a success; yet to
    to those familiar with the present condition of Liberia it is evident that
    a crisis in her existence has been reached in which she requires the ac-
    tive and persistent efforts of her friends. With all due consideration,
    not only for the patient efforts of the Society of which you have so long 
    been the esteemed secretary, but for the exertions of Christians and
    philanthropists throughout England and America, I think there has 
    been too much "waiting upon Province" for advancing the interest
    and strengthening the position of the colonists in Africa. Added to
    the disadvantages of a decreasing revenue, a growing debt and an en-
    tire absence of foreign capital, (investment of which is discouraged
    by Liberian laws,)there seems to be languor in place of decided action
    among the men who believe in the capabilities of the African race for
    self-government, and an utter indifference on the part of the United
    States towards a colony planted by ourselves in behalf of a race sub-
    ject for many years to our oppressive laws, and barred by our statutes
    from taking its place among the nations.</p>

<p>     It has been stated and generally believed that the climate of Li-
    beria is fatal to its prosperity. This in a measure perhaps is true, but 
    true only in the same degree as in all tropical countries in either
    hemisphere. Malarial fevers prevail, but not of a fatal type, and cer-
    tainly not more aggravated than on our Southern sea-board or through-
    out Central America. Even if the climate is injurious, it is an evil
    which disappears from day to day and year to year in proportion as 
    the country is cleared and population increased. If many of the colo-
    nists suffer from climatic ills, it is due partly to the hardships incident
    to emigration, but in my opinion more particularly to the fact that
    many if not most of the emigrants are of a mixed blood, and conse-</p>

<p>quently inherit the delicacy of constitution common to mulattoes in
   this country.</p>

<p>     Of all the checks to the progress of Liberia, climate, in my opinion,
   is the least. Its great bars to advancement are: first, the rivalry of
   the colony of the British crown at Sierra Leone; second, the great
   flood of Mohammedanism coming from the north and east of the Re-
   public, with apparently irresistible force; third, the want of steam com-
   munication and the consequent steady flow of emigration from this
   country; and lastly, the indifference of the United States Government
   and the people to the Republic, not only in a Christian and philiantro-
   pic point of view, but perhaps more tangibly in its commercial aspect
   as the objective point for American trade on the west coast.</p>

<p>     It may readily be understood that Sierra Leone, under the protec-
   tion of the powerful Government of Great Britain, possessed of ample
   means and always sustained by military force, urged on by the per-
   sistent efforts of British traders to monopolize more and more the val-
   uable rade of interior Africa, is constantly encroaching on Liberian 
   territory, both upon its sea-shore and upon its rather indefinable inter-
   nal limits. This aggression, although not countenanced, nor perhaps
   understood by the people of Great Britain, is nevertheless going on, un-
   til at last Liberia, losing not only her territory, but, consequently, her 
   revenue, will dwindle into a mere trading post or missionary station.
   It is a well-known fact that British steamers stop regularly for the pur-
   pose of landing and receiving cargoes on at least two points within
   the Liberian limits, as understood in this country, without regarding
   the custom laws of the Republic. The goods thus landed and received
   are taken to and from the interior of Liberia, thus not only defrauding
   her revenue, but encouraging the natives to disobey and hold in con-
   tempt all her laws. The Liberian Government made its first grave
   mistake in appealing to the British crown for protection from this in-
   justice. Its appeal should have been to the United States, which, un-
   der treaty, is requried to protect the colony from the natives within its
   borders. I do not wish to underrate the many kindnesses of the Brit-
   ish Government, and particularly of the British people, extended in earli-
   er times toward this struggling colony. In the great effort made by
   England for the abolition of the slave trade on the west coast of Afri-
   ca, Liberia was her moral ally at least, but times and conditions are 
   changed, and although the foreign slave trade has been abolished yet 
   it is a well-established fact that domestic slavery exists, not only 
   among the trives within Liberian territory, but throughout Africa, and
   to-day contributes by its labor to the commerce of that continent, from 
   which England derives such immense profits. The English philan-</p>

<p>thropists take no note of this fact, while the colonial governments and
   the British merchant take advantage of its results.</p>

<p>     However lamentable, it is nevertheless true that Mohammedanism
   is carrying all before it in a religious point of view. It has already
   reached to within 150 miles of Sierra Leone and Monrovia, the capital
   of Liberia, establishing every where its fundamental dogmas of polyg-
   amy and slavery. To those who believe in a higher and purer religion
   this forebodes a struggle prolonged in to the centuries; for it is safe to
   predict that within the next half century the native tribes of Liberia
   itself will be converted to that faith unless the Christian friends of the 
   African race in this country and in Europe rouse themselves and de-
   termine to resist its encroachments.</p>

<p>     The want of steam communication with this country, by which
   alone a constant flow of immigration, as vital to an infant colony as
   life-blood to the human system, (we prove it by the constantly increas-
   ing wealth and prosperity of our own country,) accounts for the pover-
   ty and slow growht of Liberia. A steam communication not only fosters
   this immigration, but creates a trade to supply the ever increasing
   wants of the colonists, who in turn barter the products of their new coun-
   try for our manufactures. It is the merest folly to suppose that in the 
   near future the native African will become a voluntary and persistent
   tiller of the soil for the sake of the gain arising from commerce. He
   cultivates the earth to the extent of his necessities, and while the col-
   onists can utilize him in a desultory way, Liberia must look to her im-
   ported citizens for a steady development of her agricultural wealth I
   fear very much that the Liberian himself does not quite appreciate this
   fact. A steam line from New York or Baltimore via Madeira, the Ca-
   nary Islands, the Cape de Verde, Sierra Leone and Monrovia, would not
   only prove remunerative at this time, but would rivet that country to this
   in such a way as not only to inure to our commercial good, but insure the
   progress and prosperity of Liberia. One thing is certain, unless Amer-
   ican capitalists can be found to build American ships for this purpose,
   but a few years, or perhaps months, will elapse before the English mer-
   chant will embrace the opportunity, and we shall have the mortifica-
   tion of seeing the English flag doing the work between America and
   her colony, thus depriving us of the benefits of opening a trade
   with Africa, the last and richest field left to the progressive merchant
   and Christianity must go hand in hand in the proselyting of Africa.
   The people of the United States, therefore, whether actuated by the
   desire of gain or the desire of good, are interested in the establish-
   ment of steam communication between these two countries. Imme-</p>

<p>diate and energetic attention to this fact will obviate that last and
   greatest bar to Liberian progress-the indifference of the people and
   Government of the United States to Liberian interests.</p>

<p>     The press-the great motor of public opinion in this country-rare-
   ly writes an encouraging word,or urges its readers to an intelligent con-
   sideration of the great problem now working itsef out in Liberia. The
   ill-timed and ill-digetsted effort of the Negroes themselves in this coun-
   try, which ended in the first and only voyage of the bark Azor, was ridi-
   culed throughout the land, and quoted as evidence of the incapacity of
   the race to do anything for itself. No consideration whatever seems to 
   have been given to the condition of poverty and ignorance which
   checked and hindered these poor people in their first effort to reach a
   land free from the moral oppression of a superior race. Letters about
   Liberia speak frequently with quiet self-conceit of the amusing char-
   acteristics of society there, overlooking the fact that those people,
   emerging from a state of ignorance and quasi-slavery, are struggling by
   the lights they have towards a higher plane, during which struggle
   they must necessarily endeavor to imitate the manners and customs
   of their superiors in the land which they have left. That these im-
   itations are sometimes grotesque there can be no doubt, but from the 
   thinking man such efforts merit sympathy rather than derision. At
   all events, if in the destiny of mankind it is written that the struggle 
   of the inferior to the plane of the superior is to go on throughout the
   centuries to come, then this, the first effort of the African race to es-
   tablish a free government upon its own soil, merits and should receive
   the sympathy and encouragement of every man, woman and child in America.</p>

<p>     But the apparent indifference of the American Government
   to the permanency and prosperity of Liberia has, if possible, less ex-
   use. Our statesmen, in the study of our interests and in the guidance
   of our policy, should long ago have seen that in encouraging Liberia
   they would not only afford an outlet to a discontented class of our 
   citizens, and an offset to the predominance of European power upon
   the continent of Africa, and gain a stand-point for effort as a Chris-
   tian nation, but would create and foster a market for manufactures
   which are not only each year demanding foreign marts, but already
   eagerly sough after by the 200,000,000 of people who dwell upon that
   portion of the earth's surface. I do not expect, nor indeed is it neces-
   sary, that the Government of the United States should take any ag-
   gressive position towards other countries on the African question.
   A friendly  note to a friendly Power, simply indicating that we take an
   active interest in Liberia, and would not be willing to see her territo-</p>

<p>ry curtailed or her trade restricted, and the occasional visit of an
   American man-of-war to indicate to the tribes within Liberian boun-
   daries that hte laws of Liberia must be respected, would suffice, at
   least at present, to insure the existence of the Republic.</p>

<p>     Much more on this interesting subject occurs to me, but I have said
   perhaps all that you will care to read, and some things in which perhaps
   you do not quite concur; but at all events you will permit me to sub-
   scribe myself a friend to Liberia
                              Very truly yours,
                                            R.W. Shufeldt.</p>
