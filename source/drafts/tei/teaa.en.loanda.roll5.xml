<p>Sir:
        In reply to your letter of this

<p>To Henry F. Downing, Esq.
     U.S. Consul,
        St. Paul de Loanda,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th
            inst., with refinance to your Consular drafts; the
            reason we object to your drafts, is that we have
            no business with America, and pay commission for
            collecting and remitting to England, costs
            us a considerable amount, and such drafts
            are of little use to us as a remittance in a 
            commercial way.</p>

<p>         If you could give us drafts on
            England, we should be happy to take <unclear/>
            at par and think the movement will have
            no difficulty in this, having agents in London.
                <unclear/> are dear Sir,
                    Yours truly,
                        Newton, Carnegie & Co.</p>

<p>United States Consulate
    St. Paul de Loanda
    January 12th, 1888</p>

<p>Con H.L. Rives,
     Assistant Secrtary of State
        Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to submit
    to the Department the following:
        The desire of our people to 
    intend this foreign trade is inducing
    them to look towards this and adjoining 
    parts of Africa as a possible field
    for cultivation. If this is true, it is well
    for them to know that while it is by 
    no means impossible for them to secure
    a valuable market here, there are many
    obstaclces to overcome, the greatest of which
    is inexperience but an examination
    of the methods of other countries will
    teach them much.
        The commercial nations of 
    Europe recognizing that the success
                                    of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0008.jpg"/>

<p>of endeavor in these parts depended
   upon a knowledge of its people, adopted
    a system the wisdom of which is paved
    by their large and successful dealings,
    and, if our peopleact upon the the belief
    that they can conduct their <unclear/>
    under different rules, they are making
    a mistake which will cost them dear,
    for costly experiment will only prove
    the value of England.and Germany's
    methods.</p>
    
<p>     An internale knowleddge of the
    people, their wants and their habits in
    a necessity, this is to be had only by
    contact and American resident represen
    tatives of houses, learning the dialects <unclear/>
    is of first importance; for often, the 
    purchase of produce, ddoes not so much
    defend upon the quality of the goods,
    as it does upon the the <unclear/> of the
    trades.</p>

<p>     As all or any of their habits
    may be of value as guides to a study
    of their character. I have taken this 
    method of describing a few of those
                                customs.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0009.jpg"/>

<p>customs which are more or less general.</p>

<p>     That part of this country
    which is on the coast live and between
    Lat. 5º South, and Lat. 15º 20… South
    contains some twenty different tribes.
    Then again are divided and subdiversed
    and, while in some respects are alike that
    are many points of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>     When referring to the habits
    and customs of these natives, attention
    is drawn to the question of slavery; but
    as practiced by them, it takes a com=
    plexion so mild that it crries with it
    amongst them, no hardships. Their laws
    make it a necessity for the owner to
    give them every care, attend to them where
    sick, food and clothethem, bury and marry
    and happiness in every direction, and so
    little difference is made, that the owners
    in speaking of their slaves, call them,
    son or daughter.</p>

<p>     The peaceful dispositions
    of these coast tribe prevents war from
    beign a <unclear/> for the ranks of
                                slavery</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0010.jpg"/>

<p>slavery, but these are found through
    the workings of their laws, which are
    strict, a plentitude of victims. Offices
    against property are causes for slavery or
    death, any one caught stealing <unclear/>
    be he who he may, chief or subject, the
    property of the one stolen from the most
    trivial things; for instance, spitting on
    another shoe, is looked upon as a heinous
    crime deserving of death or slavery.</p>

<p>     The source from which flows
    the greatest supply is their superstitions.
    Witchcraft is their only belief and all
    crises of accident or misfortune are
    <unclear/> to it. Sickness, death, failure
    of crops are all reasons for consultation
    with a "fetish" man, who, <unclear/> a
    victim changes him with being the course.
    The accused, and often his family, are
    either killed or sold into slavery yet
    they have the right to appeal to trial
    by ordeal. </p>

<p>     Trial with these people is
    an ordeal by poison.This custom is 
    not particular to Angola but, is 
                            common</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0011.jpg"/>

<p>common to the whole West African
   Coast for I have seen the same super
   stitution displayed with slight changes,
   in Liberia and on the Gold Coast. As
   the "modus operandi" of of applying the
   test may be found interesting, I will
   attempt to describe it.</p>

<p>     The poison used in this <unclear/>
   performance is prepared by pulverizing its
   powder the hand, thick bark of a tree
   which the natives call "sani-wood"
   the powder so made, is then dissolved
   in hot water and is taken by the indi=
   vidual in <unclear/> all and frequent doeses.
   unti it acts. It expresses itself either
   as an emetic, meaning innocence, or
   as a laxative, meaningguilt, or causes
   causes a cessation of the pulsation
   of the heart and death.</p>

<p>     The scene surrounding the
    preparation of this poison, called "casca"
    are horrid beyond the powers of description,
    and when seen by one, who in a sense,
    is a descendant of thesepeople such
    thoughts spring to being as suggests grati-
                                    tude</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0012.jpg"/>

<p>tude for causes which have made me 
   what i am.</p>

<p>     THe victim being found, the
   act begins; "fetish"men and assistants,
   with old and toothless hags adjourn
   to the depths of the forestwhere in 
   a place so formed by nature that it
   echos will multiply their howlings,
   they choose a spot and "fetish" it as suited
   to their incaulations. In a central posi-
   tion a mortar containing a pestle is
   sunk into the ground when the head
   "fetish" man, mute and with stealthy
    motions, take a position alongsidethe
    mortar, with his assistants and the 
    old hags forming, a circle around him
    and thus, in immovable silence, they
    remain until the gloom of might
    descends to land, assistance to the
    horns of the scene. Then animation
    takes the place of quiet and, the <unclear/>
    of the forest is polluted by the <unclear/>
    aeal howlings of the savage cries, <unclear/>
    circles of fires spring to life, having
    for a central figure the head "fetish"</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0013.jpg"/>

<p>"fetish" man and the mortar, between
    each of the fires are displayed their
    grotesque idols "fetishes" and "charms," and
    the making of "casca" is commenced.</p>

<p>     The head "fetish" man putting
    a piece of the bark in the mortar gives it
    a blow with pestle.This example is
    followed and repeated by his assistants
    ,and the old <unclear/>. As night 
    grows old action becomes more violent
    until the savages in, drunken, and
    delirious frenzy discard their cloths and
    brutal in their superstition, moisten the
    fatal mixture with blood flowing from
    self inflicted wounds.</p>

<p>     Blood painted savages naked
    in maddened, dance, amongst many
    fires, whose lurid flames, accents
    the forests gloom where echoes in answer
    to the howlings of the yelling throng
    find fitting accompaniment in the
    roaring of the beasts of the woods.
    The flitting bat, and mournful
    cry of the owl, with the moon
    sending her light between the 
                        exchanging</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0014.jpg"/>

<p>exchanging branches of the trees,
   to cast fantastic shadows over all
   farm a scene worthy of "Dante's Inferno."</p>

<p>     The victim, in the meantime,
   has been made the solitary occupant
   of his hut where, during the long
   hours of night, he has been forced
   to listen to the scoldings and threaten-
   ings of the women of his town, who 
   surround it. This is no light inflic-
   tion for many of them have vivid
   imaginations and are celebrated 
   for their descriptions of the powers
   of "fetish."</p>

<p>     The hottest hour of the 
   following day being the time ap-
   pointed for the application of the
   test, the subject is then taken to
   a place which has been "prepared."
   A path, fully exposed to the rays
   of the sun, at both ends of which
   are vesels containing "casca" and 
   lined on both sides with natives,
   young and old, male and female,
armed with all sorts of weapons</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0015.jpg"/>

<p>is a course on which he is to run
   back and forth until the fetish,
   which is given to him alternating at
   each end of the course, works.</p>

<p>     In running he has his 
   advocate, who <unclear/> him with a 
   bunch of palm leaves in his hand
   and encouraging him in these words
   "run, run, run, do not stumble, do not
   fall, you are innocent and "fetish" can-
   not catch you," at the same time he
   is closely pursued by a native holding
   a naked sword, who shouts "fetish"
   pursues you, confess, confess, you are
   guilty and must die." If in running
   he should stumble or fall he is at
   once and with great cruelty killed
   by those that line the path but
   if enduring fatigue, the poison
   asserts itself as an emetic, he is
   declared innocent. if as a laxitive,
   guilty; and either dies or is sold into
   slaver.</p>

<p>     Every town has King
   but he has very little power as it 
                                is</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0016.jpg"/>

<p>is all in the hands of a council com=
   posed of the old men. The crown is
   hereditary bet because of the un=
   certainty of paternity, the natural
   sequence of their understanding of the
   laws of morality it descends to the 
   child of the sister of the King</p>

<p>     When a civilized travellers
   arrives at a native town he is re=
   ceived with ceremony and treated
   kindly. Before entering a town he
   addresses its king of his desire to visit
   him, and after receiving permission
   it is well for to forward
   his compliments to King and council
   by a bottle of rum as well as by
   sending a few glass beads to the
   King's wives after entering the town
   he is at once escoted to a large
   enclosure when he finds the King
   and all his subjects, salutes are
   then given and returned, by clarifying
   the hands in a peculiar manner
   followed by a welcome in words
   replied to in like manner by the
                           traveller.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0017.jpg"/>

<p>traveller, who, after making the
   King apresent or "dash" of cloth
   and rum, is conducted to a hut
   where he finds food and a bath
   already prepared for himas well
   as one of the maidens of the town
   to act as his handmaiden. When
   the time arrives for the traveller to
   take his departure another general
   meeting and more presents the
   King, in return recieving a sheep
   or goat. Bidding farewell to 
   to the King and council some of the
   young men, warriors, conduct
   him a short distance and then 
   leave him free to pursue his journey.</p>

<p>     Theres is no ceremony of
   marriage except mutual consent.
   The man has to make a large
   present to his wife's family and
   on the n ight when his wife is
   delivered, give a "fatuka" or dance.
   If he fails to supply his wife
   who comes to him naked, with
   clothing and house keeping ap=
                           pliances</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0018.jpg"/>

<p>pliances, it becomes her right to
   return to her fathers house.</p>

<p>     Women give birth to children
   with the greatest ease. At one time
   I had occasion to want some rice
   flour, I directed a woman to pre=
   pare it and after putting her to work,
   went away, becoming occupied I
   forgot it. After a few hours I was
   reminded of the want and went
   to find out what caused the delay.
   I discovered teh same woman singing,
   and busily working at the mortar,
   and when I asked why it was not
   finished, received this reply; "<unclear/>
   I been go bush liffa make do some
   ting," at the same time lifting
   from the ground and showing me
   a new born baby.</p>

<p>     The methods of burial are 
   more compliated.The body im=
   mediately after death is put into
   a shallow hole whic has been
   dug in the floor of the hut in 
   which it died. It is then covered
                                with</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0019.jpg"/>

<p>with a thin layer of earth, even which
   fires are kept burning until the body
   becomes hardened. It is then taken 
   out and stretched on a frame and
   suspended over fires until it became
   smoke dried, after which it is stood
   in one of the corners of the hut
   where it remains, one of the family
   for years before final burial.</p>

<p>     The belief of the natives in
   "fetish" engenders a general fear of
   one another, causing them to indulge
   in many strange and amusing prac=
   tices. Hospitality makes it necessary
   that the guest be provided with "need
   and meat." This omittedoffense is given
   and an appeal is made to"fetish." It
   sometimes happens that the unexpected
   visitor finds the <unclear/> empty but
   the host, equal to the occasion,
   sends and borrows a "lent rat,"
   which is a common field rat which 
   is then covered with a paste made
   of mandirea meal and haudled
                            to</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0019.jpg"/>

<p>to the guest, who, careful not to
   touch the meat eats the meal this
   is continued until his hunger is
   satisfied when the rat is returned
   to the owner. The guest has been
   entertained with "meal and meat"
   and the host is relived from any
   fear of "fetish."</p>

<p>     Time being of no value to
   these people they will when <unclear/>
   a market for their products travel
   miles for a difference of a few
   beads or a yard of cloth, or to
   find a trader known to them. I
   remember when I was trading
   in Liberia, that in Bantu for
   a quantity of produce, I gave
   with other goods, a lot of powder
   some two months afterward the
   native who had received these
   goods returned bringing with 
   him all he had recieved, and
   complained that one of the kegs
   powder was light in weight.
   Examination showed that it</p>
