<p>Sir:
        In reply to your letter of this

<p>To Henry F. Downing, Esq.
     U.S. Consul,
        St. Paul de Loanda,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th
            inst., with refinance to your Consular drafts; the
            reason we object to your drafts, is that we have
            no business with America, and pay commission for
            collecting and remitting to England, costs
            us a considerable amount, and such drafts
            are of little use to us as a remittance in a 
            commercial way.</p>

<p>         If you could give us drafts on
            England, we should be happy to take <unclear/>
            at par and think the movement will have
            no difficulty in this, having agents in London.
                <unclear/> are dear Sir,
                    Yours truly,
                        Newton, Carnegie & Co.</p>

<p>Con H.L. Rives,
     Assistant Secrtary of State
        Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to submit
    to the Department the following:
        The desire of our people to 
    intend this foreign trade is inducing
    them to look towards this and adjoining 
    parts of Africa as a possible field
    for cultivation. If this is true, it is well
    for them to know that while it is by 
    no means impossible for them to secure
    a valuable market here, there are many
    obstaclces to overcome, the greatest of which
    is inexperience but an examination
    of the methods of other countries will
    teach them much.
        The commercial nations of 
    Europe recognizing that the success
                                    of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0008.jpg"/>

<p>of endeavor in these parts depended
   upon a knowledge of its people, adopted
    a system the wisdom of which is paved
    by their large and successful dealings,
    and, if our peopleact upon the the belief
    that they can conduct their <unclear/>
    under different rules, they are making
    a mistake which will cost them dear,
    for costly experiment will only prove
    the value of England.and Germany's
    methods.</p>
    
<p>     An internale knowleddge of the
    people, their wants and their habits in
    a necessity, this is to be had only by
    contact and American resident represen
    tatives of houses, learning the dialects <unclear/>
    is of first importance; for often, the 
    purchase of produce, ddoes not so much
    defend upon the quality of the goods,
    as it does upon the the <unclear/> of the
    trades.</p>

<p>     As all or any of their habits
    may be of value as guides to a study
    of their character. I have taken this 
    method of describing a few of those
                                customs.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0009.jpg"/>

<p>customs which are more or less general.</p>

<p>     That part of this country
    which is on the coast live and between
    Lat. 5º South, and Lat. 15º 20… South
    contains some twenty different tribes.
    Then again are divided and subdiversed
    and, while in some respects are alike that
    are many points of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>     When referring to the habits
    and customs of these natives, attention
    is drawn to the question of slavery; but
    as practiced by them, it takes a com=
    plexion so mild that it crries with it
    amongst them, no hardships. Their laws
    make it a necessity for the owner to
    give them every care, attend to them where
    sick, food and clothethem, bury and marry
    and happiness in every direction, and so
    little difference is made, that the owners
    in speaking of their slaves, call them,
    son or daughter.</p>

<p>     The peaceful dispositions
    of these coast tribe prevents war from
    beign a <unclear/> for the ranks of
                                slavery</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0010.jpg"/>

<p>slavery, but these are found through
    the workings of their laws, which are
    strict, a plentitude of victims. Offices
    against property are causes for slavery or
    death, any one caught stealing <unclear/>
    be he who he may, chief or subject, the
    property of the one stolen from the most
    trivial things; for instance, spitting on
    another shoe, is looked upon as a heinous
    crime deserving of death or slavery.</p>

<p>     The source from which flows
    the greatest supply is their superstitions.
    Witchcraft is their only belief and all
    crises of accident or misfortune are
    <unclear/> to it. Sickness, death, failure
    of crops are all reasons for consultation
    with a "fetish" man, who, <unclear/> a
    victim changes him with being the course.
    The accused, and often his family, are
    either killed or sold into slavery yet
    they have the right to appeal to trial
    by ordeal. </p>

<p>     Trial with these people is
    an ordeal by poison.This custom is 
    not particular to Angola but, is 
                            common</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0011.jpg"/>

<p>common to the whole West African
   Coast for I have seen the same super
   stitution displayed with slight changes,
   in Liberia and on the Gold Coast. As
   the "modus operandi" of of applying the
   test may be found interesting, I will
   attempt to describe it.</p>

<p>     The poison used in this <unclear/>
   performance is prepared by pulverizing its
   powder the hand, thick bark of a tree
   which the natives call "sani-wood"
   the powder so made, is then dissolved
   in hot water and is taken by the indi=
   vidual in <unclear/> all and frequent doeses.
   unti it acts. It expresses itself either
   as an emetic, meaning innocence, or
   as a laxative, meaningguilt, or causes
   causes a cessation of the pulsation
   of the heart and death.</p>

<p>     The scene surrounding the
    preparation of this poison, called "casca"
    are horrid beyond the powers of description,
    and when seen by one, who in a sense,
    is a descendant of thesepeople such
    thoughts spring to being as suggests grati-
                                    tude</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0012.jpg"/>

<p>tude for causes which have made me 
   what i am.</p>

<p>     THe victim being found, the
   act begins; "fetish"men and assistants,
   with old and toothless hags adjourn
   to the depths of the forestwhere in 
   a place so formed by nature that it
   echos will multiply their howlings,
   they choose a spot and "fetish" it as suited
   to their incaulations. In a central posi-
   tion a mortar containing a pestle is
   sunk into the ground when the head
   "fetish" man, mute and with stealthy
    motions, take a position alongsidethe
    mortar, with his assistants and the 
    old hags forming, a circle around him
    and thus, in immovable silence, they
    remain until the gloom of might
    descends to land, assistance to the
    horns of the scene. Then animation
    takes the place of quiet and, the <unclear/>
    of the forest is polluted by the <unclear/>
    aeal howlings of the savage cries, <unclear/>
    circles of fires spring to life, having
    for a central figure the head "fetish"</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0013.jpg"/>

<p>"fetish" man and the mortar, between
    each of the fires are displayed their
    grotesque idols "fetishes" and "charms," and
    the making of "casca" is commenced.</p>

<p>     The head "fetish" man putting
    a piece of the bark in the mortar gives it
    a blow with pestle.This example is
    followed and repeated by his assistants
    ,and the old <unclear/>. As night 
    grows old action becomes more violent
    until the savages in, drunken, and
    delirious frenzy discard their cloths and
    brutal in their superstition, moisten the
    fatal mixture with blood flowing from
    self inflicted wounds.</p>

<p>     Blood painted savages naked
    in maddened, dance, amongst many
    fires, whose lurid flames, accents
    the forests gloom where echoes in answer
    to the howlings of the yelling throng
    find fitting accompaniment in the
    roaring of the beasts of the woods.
    The flitting bat, and mournful
    cry of the owl, with the moon
    sending her light between the 
                        exchanging</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0014.jpg"/>

<p>exchanging branches of the trees,
   to cast fantastic shadows over all
   farm a scene worthy of "Dante's Inferno."</p>

<p>     The victim, in the meantime,
   has been made the solitary occupant
   of his hut where, during the long
   hours of night, he has been forced
   to listen to the scoldings and threaten-
   ings of the women of his town, who 
   surround it. This is no light inflic-
   tion for many of them have vivid
   imaginations and are celebrated 
   for their descriptions of the powers
   of "fetish."</p>

<p>     The hottest hour of the 
   following day being the time ap-
   pointed for the application of the
   test, the subject is then taken to
   a place which has been "prepared."
   A path, fully exposed to the rays
   of the sun, at both ends of which
   are vesels containing "casca" and 
   lined on both sides with natives,
   young and old, male and female,
armed with all sorts of weapons</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0015.jpg"/>

<p>is a course on which he is to run
   back and forth until the fetish,
   which is given to him alternating at
   each end of the course, works.</p>

<p>     In running he has his 
   advocate, who <unclear/> him with a 
   bunch of palm leaves in his hand
   and encouraging him in these words
   "run, run, run, do not stumble, do not
   fall, you are innocent and "fetish" can-
   not catch you," at the same time he
   is closely pursued by a native holding
   a naked sword, who shouts "fetish"
   pursues you, confess, confess, you are
   guilty and must die." If in running
   he should stumble or fall he is at
   once and with great cruelty killed
   by those that line the path but
   if enduring fatigue, the poison
   asserts itself as an emetic, he is
   declared innocent. if as a laxitive,
   guilty; and either dies or is sold into
   slaver.</p>

<p>     Every town has King
   but he has very little power as it 
                                is</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0016.jpg"/>

<p>is all in the hands of a council com=
   posed of the old men. The crown is
   hereditary bet because of the un=
   certainty of paternity, the natural
   sequence of their understanding of the
   laws of morality it descends to the 
   child of the sister of the King</p>

<p>     When a civilized travellers
   arrives at a native town he is re=
   ceived with ceremony and treated
   kindly. Before entering a town he
   addresses its king of his desire to visit
   him, and after receiving permission
   it is well for to forward
   his compliments to King and council
   by a bottle of rum as well as by
   sending a few glass beads to the
   King's wives after entering the town
   he is at once escoted to a large
   enclosure when he finds the King
   and all his subjects, salutes are
   then given and returned, by clarifying
   the hands in a peculiar manner
   followed by a welcome in words
   replied to in like manner by the
                           traveller.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0017.jpg"/>

<p>traveller, who, after making the
   King apresent or "dash" of cloth
   and rum, is conducted to a hut
   where he finds food and a bath
   already prepared for himas well
   as one of the maidens of the town
   to act as his handmaiden. When
   the time arrives for the traveller to
   take his departure another general
   meeting and more presents the
   King, in return recieving a sheep
   or goat. Bidding farewell to 
   to the King and council some of the
   young men, warriors, conduct
   him a short distance and then 
   leave him free to pursue his journey.</p>

<p>     Theres is no ceremony of
   marriage except mutual consent.
   The man has to make a large
   present to his wife's family and
   on the n ight when his wife is
   delivered, give a "fatuka" or dance.
   If he fails to supply his wife
   who comes to him naked, with
   clothing and house keeping ap=
                           pliances</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0018.jpg"/>

<p>pliances, it becomes her right to
   return to her fathers house.</p>

<p>     Women give birth to children
   with the greatest ease. At one time
   I had occasion to want some rice
   flour, I directed a woman to pre=
   pare it and after putting her to work,
   went away, becoming occupied I
   forgot it. After a few hours I was
   reminded of the want and went
   to find out what caused the delay.
   I discovered teh same woman singing,
   and busily working at the mortar,
   and when I asked why it was not
   finished, received this reply; "<unclear/>
   I been go bush liffa make do some
   ting," at the same time lifting
   from the ground and showing me
   a new born baby.</p>

<p>     The methods of burial are 
   more compliated.The body im=
   mediately after death is put into
   a shallow hole whic has been
   dug in the floor of the hut in 
   which it died. It is then covered
                                with</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0019.jpg"/>

<p>with a thin layer of earth, even which
   fires are kept burning until the body
   becomes hardened. It is then taken 
   out and stretched on a frame and
   suspended over fires until it became
   smoke dried, after which it is stood
   in one of the corners of the hut
   where it remains, one of the family
   for years before final burial.</p>

<p>     The belief of the natives in
   "fetish" engenders a general fear of
   one another, causing them to indulge
   in many strange and amusing prac=
   tices. Hospitality makes it necessary
   that the guest be provided with "need
   and meat." This omittedoffense is given
   and an appeal is made to"fetish." It
   sometimes happens that the unexpected
   visitor finds the <unclear/> empty but
   the host, equal to the occasion,
   sends and borrows a "lent rat,"
   which is a common field rat which 
   is then covered with a paste made
   of mandirea meal and haudled
                            to</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0020.jpg"/>

<p>to the guest, who, careful not to
   touch the meat eats the meal this
   is continued until his hunger is
   satisfied when the rat is returned
   to the owner. The guest has been
   entertained with "meal and meat"
   and the host is relived from any
   fear of "fetish."</p>

<p>     Time being of no value to
   these people they will when <unclear/>
   a market for their products travel
   miles for a difference of a few
   beads or a yard of cloth, or to
   find a trader known to them. I
   remember when I was trading
   in Liberia, that in Bantu for
   a quantity of produce, I gave
   with other goods, a lot of powder
   some two months afterward the
   native who had received these
   goods returned bringing with 
   him all he had recieved, and
   complained that one of the kegs
   powder was light in weight.
   Examination showed that it</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0021.jpg"/>

<p>wanted about 1/2 of a pound the
   mistake corrected he went away
   satisfied. so to recover a value 
   of about twenty cents, he, with
   some twenty carriers, had spent 
   at least six weeks on the road.</p>

<p>     A peculiarity is their
   dislike to trade with strangers.
   They prefer to take less from
   or be cheated by traders when 
   they know and who are familiar 
   with their habits. This prejudice
   is overcome only by contact
   and learning their ways.</p>

<p>     The customs and habits
   as before described are more or
   less common, to Angola and the
   whole of the West Coast. There are
   many more, local in their nature,
   that, or which, may be subject
   matter for future dispatches.</p>

<p>Hon Q. L. Rives.

<p>Sir:
            I have the honor to inform
   the Department that my residence in
   Loanda,this short, has shown me that
   it is impossible under present arrangment
   for me to live upon the salary allowed
   by the present laws. The frequent attention
   of a physician and in many directions 
   a departure from that strict economy
   which might bring expenses within that
   amount allowed is the effect of an
   African climate where to this is added
   the expense of providing for a family
   in the U.S., it will be seen that by
   assuming this position at an early
   date. I am not only just to myself
   but am acting towards my government
                                 with</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0024.jpg"/>

<p>with frankness and with dependence
   upon its justice.</p>

<p>         The importance of this Consulate
   is such as is derived from the cultiavation
   of African trade. Cape Coast the daily
   growing in importance, Lagos, Benny, at the
   mouth of the Niger with many other points,
   are valuable; but Monrovia, Gabon and
   this place areand politically and commercial
   ly the important points on this coast.</p>

<p>         Those districts, which are
   watered by the Congo and its affluents,
   since the establishmentof the "Congo Free
   State" by Mr Stanley, under the protection
   of the Belgian Government have gained
   a value in the age of the commercial
   world <unclear/> to no other part of the
   coast. The effect of this has naturally
   given to Loanda, because of its geographi
   cal position an impetus expressing
   itself in many directions: for instance,
   railroads, water works etc.</p>

<p>         Given these facts, it will be
   concided that, as a factor to advance
   our foreign trade it is necessary that
                                       it</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0025.jpg"/>

<p>it should be cultivated in this direction.
   While as a means towards this end a
   Consulate here is of significance, the 
   first consideration should be the Consul.</p>

<p>       When the interests of our country
   are placed in the hands of a trader, they
   must suffer, more particularly in a district
   such as this, where his whole duty is such
   as relate to the advance of our foreign
   trade.</p>

<p>        A trading Consul not only is
   at times prejudiced in jdugement and
   dependent in action, but he also often
   finds occasion to make the performance
   of public duty give way to private inter=
   ests.</p>

<p>        Induced by these opinions I 
   have desired to keep myself in that 
   position which would cause me to think
   through influence and independence to
   protect and advance the interests of
   American trade and to protect American
   citizens in their property but I have
   failed and I find that unless
                                    some</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0026.jpg"/>

<p>some way is found for supplementing my
   income. I cannot remain here.</p>

<p>         This being the case I would
   respectfully ask from the Department
   its favorable decision in its consideration
   of either of the following requests: Virg,
   1º: A recommendation to his Excellency the
        Presidentfor my transfer to Liberia
        as Consul General (see papers on file
        in Dept.),
   2º Leave to visit the United States for
        the purpose of forming such business
        connections as will permit me to
        remain in charge of this Consulate
    3º Leave to return to the United 
       State for the purpose of tendering
       my resignation.</p>

<p>         I regret that necessity
   forces me into this position but i have
   no option. It is better for me to "grasp
   my mettle," than it is to seen the
   risk fo <unclear/> my government
   as I am sorry to say, has here
   and before by United States
   Consuls here laboring under the same</p>

<p>Sir:
            I have the honor to inform
   the Department, an expedition of
   th land and sea forces under the command
   of Senor Joan Antonio de Buisac das 
   Neves Ferreira Captain of the Frigates Gov.
   of COngo have taken military occupation
   in the name of the King of Portugal
   of a tract of land north of Loanda
   and Ambrig. in the neighborhood of
   parallel 7º S and known as Ambrigette.</p>

<p>         'Tho the strong natural
   limit of Angola i.e., as regards climate
   fauna and ethnology is from the Congo
   River to Cape <unclear/>, yet the country occupied
   by the Portugese, until this later addition
   was only from Ambrigto <unclear/>

<p>         The natives inhabiting this
   part of the coast are called "<unclear/>"
   The natural effect of the slave trade was
   to encourage thm into indolence but
   since all hope of it being again establish-
   ed has passed away the development of
   produce in the district and from the
   interior has been great, and premises
   to become much of greater and very important
   in amount</p>

<p>        At present most of the 
   produce comes from the interior. The system
   of trade differs from that of other points
   and is complicated and curious. All 
   produce-except ivory-<unclear/> being brought
   to the trader is weighed and price
   argued in English "<unclear/> in Portugese
   "<unclear/>". This "<unclear/>" or "<unclear/> is the unit
   of exchange to which all articles of
   barter are referenced: for instance, good
   blue glass beads; a 4ds common cotton
   cloth ; etc. are equal to a "<unclear/>" or "<unclear/>
   articles of greater value are more long
   each.</p>

<p>                Being <unclear/> to allow
                                        the</p>

<p>the natives to enter the factories. the buyer
   gives the seller a paper witht he number of "<unclear/>
   or "<unclear/> written on it. which the holder
   presents a window of the store when he receives
   its value in goods. It can be imagined what
   shouting and noise there must be when <unclear/>
   are gathered before one under each clamoring
   to be paid first but practice has enabled
   the trader to become an expert in the hardship
   these people that the chattering chords  seem
   to melt away</p>

<p>         The principal rpoducts are coffee,
   peanuts, fibre, <unclear/> seed, red gum <unclear/>
   white angola gum india-rubber , palm kernals,
   palm oil and <unclear/></p>

<p>         Several menial deposits
   of more or less value, are <unclear/> the
   most important/are, one of mineral pitch
   and another of malaohite but the natives,
   through fear of annexation, have made 
   these deposits "fetish" and as they are
   reached via the beautiful Ambrigette
   river unfortunately navigable only by
   canoes the natives allow no white men
   to go furhter towards its source than
                                       a</p>

<p>         This expression of the policy of
   the Portugese is in accord with their many
   efforts to promote the interests of the province
   giving them an added influence in the 
   Congo and making Angola more interesting
   to the commercial world.</p>

<p>Translation</p>

<p>The most Illustrious and Excellent for:</p>

<p>         I have the honor to announce to your
   Excellency, the in obedience to orders, I arrived
   at this place on the 22nd of the current month,
   between the hours of 10 and 11 in the morning
   and after seeing that the forces had their mid-
   day meal, all other things being in readiness I
   gave the necessary order to disembark which operation
   commenced at 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>         Knowing the harbor because of former visits,
   I allowed the Bart "Cabinda" to near the shore, while,
   "the Steamer" Massabe," having been ordered to 
   follow in sailing order in the rear, did not
   arrive until later when during the calm hours 
   of night, she took the "Cabinda" in tow and <unclear/>
   her seven miles to the point of disembaration.</p>

<p>         Disembarking my forces, I sent in the
   fisrt boat the Resident with some workers and
   native servants with instructions to care for boats
   as they arrived: Having done this I next sent ashore
   by squadrons the 1st platoon of a Company of..
   infantry, giving ashore myself I caused the
   troops to occupy at quick step, a commanding
   position on an elevation to the south of a village,
   which rested on the edge of a swamp, and to
   the rear of the English factory of Hatton & <unclear/></p>

<p>         The other platoon of infantry having lauded
   by squadrons, the artillery supplied with one 
   section of camp equipments and baggage.
   This disembarkation was compelled during the
                                           night</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0034.jpg"/>

<p>night and happily wihtout loss, for in order to
   prevent accidents I detailed a few sailors as a 
   rescuecorps and to assist in landing. Simultaneous
   ly with the disembarking I switched the <unclear/>
   of the troops and the posting of the necessary 
   sentries for the night.</p>

<p>            The following morning I planted a mast
   brought from "Cabinda" for the purpose, then amidst
   the sounds of trumpets; the beating of drums; the
   military salutes of the of the infantry the national salute
   from the artillery and from the vessels of the <unclear/>
   gay in a holdiay array of flays, I raised and
   gave to the breeze the national emblem of our country.
   and declared, in the presence of Becoa de Roi and
   other native princes summoned by me to be present,
   that I took possession of the country in the name
   of Portugal's King; but that our intentions were
   amicable and meant no wrong to them yet
   a continuation of the kindness depended upon 
   the future actions. Attempting to <unclear/>.
   they said that our flag could not be dsiplayed
   without the permission of their monarch for
   reply, I told them that I did not summon
   them for the purpose of asking permission from
   their King, but as witness to my act, and
   that it mattered not whether permission was
   given or not. These natives before taking their
   departure mentioned a time for returning where
   at a conference they would advise me as to
   their King's decision, On the 26th they returned
   and informed me that their king had decided
   to accept what he could not prevent .</p>

<p>             No disturbance has bee caused business
   having been carried on as <unclear/> at the factories
   so that, I can report, without answering for

<p>To the President,
    Your Excellency:
                Although it is the
   good fortune of the negroes in the United
   States to be brought under the influence
   of a people whose example is leading
   them towards higher levels, a knowledge
   of the peculiar conditions which sur-
   rounds their history, prevents teh suppo=
   sition that it is possible for them, at 
   this early date, to have reached that
   situation where they can, as a <unclear/>,
   be independent of <unclear/> reasons
   for endeavor.</p>

<p>             This being allowed
  it becomes easy for me, without prejud=
  cing myself to enter into a relation
  of circumstances surrounding my present
  situation, from which I desire to be
  relieved.
                    The</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10005.jpg"/>

<p>             The public value which attach=
   es to a Consulate is derived from many
   sources, at some the duties are almost
   only clerical,at others they become
   judicial, at others diplomatic and,
   so on until we touch that <unclear/>
   that find great, and important work in
   laboring for the augmentation of our
   foreign trade and this last mentioned
   <unclear/> is divided by the difference which
   is bewteen Consulates engaged in the en=
   largement of trade relations already
   established and those whose duty it
   is to open up new trade connections. The
   opening up of new trade does not apply
   only to those places where commercial=
   ready exists, but also to those places
   having a possible future commercial value.</p>

<p>                That our growing industries
   are finding new outlets in West Africa
   the evidence of our exports, proves, but
   these markets are open to improving cul=
   tiation and under the case of Consuls
   who are American Citizens, able, because
                            compensated.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10006.jpg"/>

<p>compensated, to confine themselves to
   the performance of the duties of their
   office, their value would soon be ex=
   pressed in the most happy results.</p>

<p>             Opposed to a Consul endang=
   ering his official usefulness and weakening
   his influence or placing himself in a 
   position preventing indpendent and 
   unprejudiced action by being engaged
   in business, I took charge of this Con=
   sulate with the hope of being able to 
   live upon my salary but now after 
   and in spite of every economy. I
   find that it is impossible, and unless
   I can secure a larger income it will
   be necessary for me to leave this service
   of my country.</p>

<p>             Recognizing an extended
   field on this coast for the expressions
   of such intelligent action as would
   benefit our commercial interests, I
   am anxious to remain. Familiar with
   the commerce of my own country, its
   industries and manufactures, I am
   confident, if opportunity is given
                                  me</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10007.jpg"/>

<p>me to utilize the knowledge which
   I have of Africa, its people and its 
   trade, that I will be able to do
   something towards, adding to our
   foreign trade.</p>

<p>             Because of the reasons as
   before stated, I respectfully ask to
   be transferred to Liberia as Consul
   General and I hope your Excellency,
   that this request will met with your
   approbation and induce favorable
   action in the premises.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be,

   to me from St. Thomé with enclosed letter,
   (enclosure no. 2) upon finishing it improperly

<p>     The general behavior Mr-

<p>We have all kinds of advantages of the

   here-such for instance, as paying his bills
   with <unclear/> drafts-headed "U.S. Consulate"
   which gave his victims the impression that
   what said drafts-promised national value
   with our government- Some of these drafts
   or one of them at least has given for more

<p>The Honorable
    Q.L. Rives
     Assistant Secretary of State
      Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
        I have to inform the department
   that as Mr. Henry F. Downing failed
   record his official correspondence
   in the dispatch book I am unable 
   to number my dispatches and I
   consequently leav ethem un numbered
   until the numbering is correctly
   adjusted by the department.</p>

<p>     Since the receipt of the Consulat
   regulations from the department, I
   have learned that the Consulate is,
   with the exception of the archives
   (an inventory of which I foward
   herewith) wholly without the proper
   legal belongings of the office</p>

<p>     As I informed the departmet in 
   my communication of the 15th ultimo
   all belongings of this Consulate were
   seized by Mr. Henry F. Downings
   creditors, between the 15th and 30th of 
   last March while he was in transit 
   to America and before I assumed
   the duites of the office.</p>

<p>     After presenting my credentials to
                                       the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10031.jpg"/>

<p>the Governor General of the province
   I requests his interference in 
   relation to the delivery of the 
   Consular effects into my hands and
   his advice to me was to the effect
   that I hsould pay the indebtedness
   and take charge as he had no grounds 
   for interference considering the fact
   that Mr. Downing had led his creditors
   to believe that the United States were
   responsible for his debts and doings
   out here.</p>

<p>Having no other alternative I
   went so far as to redeem the
   archives, as the whole affair was
   beign ery disgracefully talked about
   and knowing also that the state
   archives were not for the hands
   and eyes for the outside world.
   For the redemption of the archives
   I paid one hundred and forty seven
   dollars and sixty eight cents $147.68.</p>

<p>    I have also ordered for the
   Consulate four (4) chairs, one ordinary
   table, one large receptacle for archives
   to protect them from insects which
   are very destructive here until the
   department furnishes something
   better. I have also ordered a 
                    flag staff</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10032.jpg"/>

<p>flag staff to be erected, the cost
   of which is 116 mil reis or 
   $125.28. I have an old flag of
   my own which I will use until
   the department furnishes me with
   another more appropriate.</p>

<p> The deparmtent will please also
   furnish me with stationary and
   office furniture as it cannot be
   purchased here as cheaply as in
   the United States transportation
   and all considered.</p>

<p> I desire to have a boat
   also, if the department will be
   good enough to supply one as it
   costs over $1.50 for the hire of 
   a boat every time I visit a ship.</p>

<p> I drew on the treasury in last
   month for $20 a draft in favor
   of John Hass but not having any
   regualtions I find it was improperly
   made out but from the nature of 
   the circumstances I cannot but
   hope that it was honored never-
   the-less.</p>

             to be Sir

<p>Sir:
        I have the honro to
   acknowledge the receipt of departments
   dispatch dated June 15th as well as a 
   printed paper, "instructions to 
Consular Officer on leave."</p>

<p>     Referring to said dispatch,
   I would report that I left my
   Consular district on the 5th of
   April, 1888. As regards the terms
   of agreement between Mr. Judson
   and myself. they are in effect, to
   allow me to draw all that may
   be due the Consulate until such
   time as I may return to my post.
   for this Mr. Judson has already received
   an equivalent. The rules contained
                                   in</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20004.jpg"/>

<p>in above mentioned instructions to 
   Consular Officers on leave here, today,
   for the first time come under my
   notice. Therefore, having no knowledge 
   of any rule which made it necessary to have
   a written agreement, to be furnished in
   duplicate. i have failed unfortunately, to
   provide one and are force to ask the De-
   partment to accept  statement as a 
   fact.</p>

<p>     I, having received no intimation
   from the Department; that it had acted
   favorably on my recommendation of
   Mr. Baines as Vice Consul, although his
   Bond was forwarded at the same time
   as my dispatch recommending his appoint
   ment-, I thought it achievable to not
   leave Mr. Baines in charge, and await
   an expression from the Department
   relative to his appointment as prema-
   nent Vice Consul.</p>

<p>Hon. Q.L. Rives
    Assistant Secretary of State
     Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
            Referring to certain changes
   contained in dispatch of acting Vice
   Consul Julius L. Judson of St. Paul
   de Loanda dated May 16, 1888. i have 
   the honor to inform the Department,
   that Loanda on the 17th of
   March I arrived at Cabinda on the
   19th of the same month where I found
   Mr. Judson and delivered to him the
   Consular Seal and Stamp with in-
   structions to proceed immediately to
   Loanda, but not to assume the duties
   of his office until the 31st, when 
   I would be learning St. Homé, the
   Northern land of the Consular district
   which place I desired to visit for
                                   the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20006.jpg"/>

<p>the purpose of gathering information
   which might be of commercial value.</p>

<p> It is true that I returned to 
   Mr. Judson his bond. My motive for
   doing this was not so much that it
   was not properly made out but
   that, having no knowledge of the 
   sureties named in the instrument,
   I was not satisfied as to their respon-
   sibility, and I judged that by 
   making it necessary for him to 
   provide another, he would be forced 
   to have it certified to by some of
   the Portugese authorities and therby
   give reason to believe in its value.</p>

<p> Against the charges as to my 
   general behavior while in Loanda, I
   do not know how to defend myself,
   unless they are specified, but will 
   say, that cohersion any action of more
   as U.S. Consul at Loand, has been
   subject matter for criticism, i have
   to learn.</p>

<p> 1st So far from being able
   to take advantage of the "confidence
                                   not</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20007.jpg"/>

<p>not to say ignorance of the
   Portugese" for instance, by "paying
   my bills with bogus drafts." I found
   it impossible to get them to accept
   good, honest government drafts, for,
   with one exception, viz. Messrs Newton-
   Carnegie & Co. There was no house
   doing business in Loanda that
   would handle an U.S. Consular
   draft of any kind, and furthermore,
   A Mr. Judson's statements are to
   be considered, value should be given
   to that part of his dispatch which
   I have quote, "It is thought here
   that the smallness of the salary,
   is the reason that U.S. Consuls
   sent here generally resort to finan-
   cial treachery and intrigue and 
   almsot invariably leave in disgrace."
   If this has been the experience of 
   the Portugese in Loanda with U.
   S. Consuls it is would seem that
   They must be fond of having
   Theier confidence and ignorance
   again and agian taken advantage
                                of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20008.jpg"/>

<p>of.</p>

<p>     To my knowledge there has
   been no business done by me with
   paper, except with the well informed
   houses of Newton, Carnegie & Co. and
   Baines, Larent & Co. and neither of
   these houses are Portugese.</p>

<p>     Reforming to te statement
   that on his arrival at Loanda, he
   found that my creditors had seized
   everything belonging to the Consulate
   I would respectfuly inform the De-
   partment that in accordance with
   arrangement entered into between
   me, Baines Laurent ¶ CO and my creditors,
   Messrs Baines, Laurent & Co. retreived
   me from all other creditors but them
   selves, by taking upon their house
   my debts and the seizure, I think,
   will resolve itself in a matter of
   an owner taking possession of 
   what he was authorized by me 
   to take. This is explained as follows:
   I had certain furniture from
   a dealer, for household use, for
                                which</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20009.jpg"/>

<p>which I was to pay 40 mil
   reis per month to protect him-
   self. <unclear/>, the owner just
   before my departure furnished 
   me with are <unclear/> bill of
   sale and requested me to attch-
   a note to <unclear/> stating in set
   terms that the property was his,
   and that he was authorized
   to remove some at such time
   as best suited his convenience.
   This I did, and I <unclear/> that
   Mr. Judson was cognizant of
   this arrangement for he, with
   me,called upon Mr. <unclear/> and 
   arranged with his debtor to carry
   the contract over on the same
   terms. Mr. Judosn at the same 
   time called with me on the owner 
   of the house where was located
   the Consular office, and <unclear/>
   to continue any lease. Therefore,
   that this property was taken away
   may be true, but, that the property
                                    of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20010.jpg"/>

<p>of the United States was seized
   I fancy a statement that should be
   viewed with suspicion, particularly
   that part which refers to the action
   of his Excellency the Governor Gener-
   al, i.e., in refusing to take cognizance
   of the matter. From my knowledge
   of this Portugese gentleman, I think
   that he is too careful and well 
   informed an official to subject
   himself to reprimand or recall,
   by encouraging an infraction
   of the Treaty between the U.S. and
   Portugal. Furthermore, how could
   my "victims" be led to belived
   that the U.S. Government would
   be any more responsible for my
   debts of Consuls who preceeded
   me. If this view of the case is
   accepted, it will seem that 
   the payment of my debts, means the
   purchase of household furniture
   by Mr. Judson, for his personal use.</p>

<p>             I would respectfully
                                inform</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20011.jpg"/>

<p>inform the Department that
   one copy of Consular instructions
   of 1888 as well as all correspondence
   properly <unclear/> and filed away,
   as well as furniture soemwhat in
   excus of what is allowed is or 
   should be at the office of the
   Consulate.</p>

<p>         Referring again to Mr.
   Judson's statement, that he has
   no Consular instruction no forms,
   no products or anything I would
   say that Mr. Judson was a guest
   at my home there fore quite
   two weeks when I tried to educate
   himinto the duties of the office,
   and it sums quite a coincidence,
   that he could so happily name
   the right acct, "miscellaneous
   expenses." for his draft in <unclear/>
   of Mr. Hass of Lisbon.</p>

<p>           Mr. Edmund A. Baines
   may not be in Loanda but he 
   is then in Cabinda where Mr. 
   Judson resided, but, Mr. Baines
                            should</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20012.jpg"/>

<p>should be in Loanda no later than 
   August.</p>

<p>         In connection with the
   above, should respectfully submit
   the enclosed letter from Mr. Judson
   to me which I find, bears the same
   date as his dispatch to the Department.</p>

<p>         Knowing nothing of the Rev.
   Mr. Judson, from others, that can 
   reflect unfavorably, upon his
   character, I have confined myself
   to facts.</p>

<p>         I have the honor to be,
             Sir,
              Your obedient servant,

        June 30, 1888</p>

<p>To the Honorable
    Q.L. Rives
     Assistant Secretary of State
      Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
        I beg leave to make the following-
   statement to the department viz
   I have been for several weeks very sick
   with rheumatic fever, have had the doctor 
   nearly every day for the past three weeks-
   Most of the <unclear/> and Consular Correspon-
   dence for this quarter I have had to arrange
   while in bed suffering most excruciating
   pains, and only getting a little help oc-
   casionally when visited by an English friend
   Mr. Downing's disgraceful career here has also
   induced if very hard for me as I can
   find no one here willing to honor a draft
   on the U.S. government. I have consequently
   exhausted all the means I brought to Loanda and
   have drawn on all the ready money I had in
   Cabinda to meet the expenses of this quarter, today 
   nothing of my own doctors bill and medicine.
   The disorder from whcih I am suffering is very
   prevalent here and seems to beyond the power
   of the Portugese doctors.</p>

<p>     I have the honor <unclear/> to beg the department to
   excuse this paper and that upon which most
   of my returns are made as it was impossible to
   procure other of the proper page. All the Consular
   visiting material being still in the hands of Mr.
   Downing's creditors. I promise the department
                                            that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20014.jpg"/> 

<p>that as soon as I am furnished with proper forms and
   instructions small endeavors to render my accounts
   as neatly and as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>I note theGovernor General a second time con-
   cerning the Consular effects held by Mr. Downing's
   creditors referring him to the treaty between the U.S.
   and Portugal, he immediately advised me to <unclear/>
   legal proceedings in the local courts for their recovery.
   This will of course entail expenses which 
   have no authority to make, which expenses may 
   amount to several times the value of the 
   effects in question, please advise me as to this.</p>

<p>         Mr. Downing carried with him
    all the forms for making out drafts except two
   or three which he had partially spoiled-
   Consequently of mine made out on unofficial
   paper as I could do no better notwithstanding
   this, I hope you will honor or pay them, if you
   dont, and force me to wait until I can get
   forms, etc. I will starve here in Loanda-
   Mr. Newton the English Vice Consul and former
   U.S. Vice Consul returned here a few days since from
   Madura where he has gone for his health and tomeet
   his wife upon his ascertaining that Mr. Downing had
   also defrauded him off a large amount, he told me
   that he misleaded to let the next Consul sent here
   starve as they moved all have done had he not
   cared for them</p>

<p>         I write this by in bed on board the Portugese
        mail steamer on route for Cabinda wehre i will remain
        three or four days to see if I shall not get better,
        of course I would not dare forward the department
          such a mutilated dispatch under ordinary cirucmstances
        but I have not walked in a month begging your leaving
                            I have the honor to be

<p>Hon. Q.L. Ries,
    Asst. Secretary of State

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to inform 
   the Department that i hereby tender  
   my resignation, to take date fro the 
   receipt of this of the office of U.S.
   Consul at St. Paul de Loanda,
   Africa.</p>

<p>     Explanation of this my
   action is found in teh fact that the
   compensation of the office is such as
   will force any one into many em-
   barrassments. This has, unfortunately,
   been my experience both in Africa and
   at home.</p>

<p>     After having been incumbent
   of this office for longer than a year, I

<p>find that I am compelled to resign

<p>     The poignancy of my sorrow is
   added to when I remember that the 
   difficulties surrounding my situation
   does not alone touch me but, threatens
   also my wife and children.</p>

<p>     Praying that my resignation
   will be accepted and thanking the
   Department for its patience and
   great consideration.</p>

<p>Hon. Q.L. Rives
    Asst. Secretary of State.
     Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to acknowledge
   the receipt of Department's dispatch dated
   the 2d inst.</p>

<p>     I would respectfully advise
   that deprived of opportunity, because of
   distance to secure information, I have no
   connections to make as to statement of 
   facts as therein mentioned, but I
   regret that it was not in the power
   of the Department to assume the posi
   tion i now takes before I had now further
   compelled myself to the government
   in a precurring way since my arrival
   in the United States. I have been allow-
   ed and paid $170.00. acct. salary, also
   under instructions from the Treasury 
                            Department</p>
<pb facs="ViewScan_20023.jpg"/>

<p>Department I on the 2d inst. disposed
   of a draft on the Secretary of the Treasury 
   at 15d/s for $65.1 17/100 residue of salary.
   This latter draft I am able to and will
   withdraw. Referring to other drafts
   drawn by me I understand that
   with the exception of two they have 
   all been paid. These two that were
   returned unpaid I have recovered
   and have satisfied teh parties who
   held them. Viz <unclear/> Dan Lolway
   <unclear/> & Co. of New York and Joseph Laylor.
   of Brooklyn in the amount as per
   their face value. THie relieves the
   Department from the necessity of considerings them.</p>

<p>     In recommending the 
   removal fo Robt. L. Newton Esq. as
   U.S. Consul at St. Paul de Loanda
   I had in view only the performance
   of my duty as an U.S. Consul i.e, as
   far as it touched the cultlivation of
   our foreign trade. A vast market teeming
   with fast developing riches offering
   prizes to commercial enterprise, I
                                found</p>

<p>found, on my arrival at Loanda,
   monopolized by European nations. I 
   saw with envious jealousy the vessels
   of England. Germany, Holland and 
   other European countries emptying that
   fertile land of its products and their
   ciiezens growing wealthy through
   well directed efforts of their Consuls
   not the least active of whom was
   H.B. M's COnsul Robt. L. Newton Esq.
   knowing that at one time America
   had been building up a trade there
   growing in importance every day but
   had now died. I believed it would 
   be wise to find the reason for its
   decline. On examination I found
   that the withdrawing of American
   bottoms from the African trade during
   our domestic troubles while interrupting
   did not destroy our commercial prestige
   in that direction for our exports to 
   Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cape 
   Town are still making gratifing
   advance yet Angola, a province
   written the valuable district of 
                                the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20025.jpg"/>

<p>the Congo with its principal city 
   Loanda had been gradually
   eliminated from a condition of use-
   fulness to our industries until now
   commercial intervene is nil and
   the situation is suc as allows the
   mercantile house of Newton, Carnegie
   & Co. to inform the Department through
   me that <unclear/> is no paying <unclear/>
   for the introduction of American goods
   there, and this in the face of the fact
   that England finds there a rowing
   and paying market for, not only
   her wares, but can dispose of in large
   quantities, of petroleum orginally
   bought from us. Correspondence with
   other and disinterested merchants avised
   me that only a want of knowledge
   of American products prevented their use
   I therefore had reason to think that
   the competition between nations, which
   is finding an opportunity to express
   itself so positively in Africa, hindered
   a Commercial Agent of the most, ag-
   gressive, commercially, nation of the
                                    world.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20026.jpg"/>

<p>world. England from during justice to
   the needs of our revising commerce. For
   this, with other reasons I recommended the
   removal of Mr. R.S. Newton.</p>

<p>         When I nominated Mr.Baines
   I did not know that it was his intention
   to be for any time absent from Loanda
   <unclear/> embarrassments every day growing
   more serious and prohibiting further residences
   mad my departure from Loanda <unclear/>
   and, a sting when leave as granted by    
   the Department. I took such steps in
   the absence of Mr.Baines as would. I 
   thought: be approved by the Department
   and without prejudiceto Mr. Baine's
   appointment requested the Governor of
   the Province to recognize Mr. Judson as
   act'g U.S. Consul.</p>

<p>         Mr. Judson's capacity was
   beyond dispute and as an ordained
   minister of the gospel enjoying the con-
   fidence of Bishop Taylor and as an
   American citizen he was envisioned by
   such qualities as naturally earned for
   him my confidence, causing me without
                                hesitation</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20027.jpg"/>

<p>hesitation, to entrust him with the tempora-
   ry change of the Consulate. That he has 
   used the powers entrusted with him in a 
   wrong manner is to be deplored but, at
   the same time, I think that I should 
   be relieved from my blame except
   such as may attach to an allowable 
   mistake.</p>

<p>         In justice to myself I must
   call attention to the fact that Mr. Judson
   had no right or, recognizable right, 
   to admit that the U.S. government was
   responsible for my private debts by the
   payment of my debts recover govmnt
   property, There was a proper remedy
   which if applied would have cost
   the government or the Consulate anything.</p>

<p>         I have no thought or desire
   to think responsibility for this man's
   actions but i regret that earlier knowl-
   edge in the premises was not mine, for 
   then I would not have taken up 
   my part of my pay and thereby
   would have been much less in debt
   to the government.</p>
<p>                             What</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20028.jpg"/>

<p>         What course the Department
   may elect to pursue in this matter
   I do not know yet having confidence
   in its justice law at its dispersal and
   will act in accordance with its in-
   structions.</p>

<p>         I have the honor to be,
             Sir,
              Your obedient servant.

<p>     It is my painful duty to have to report to the
   Department the death of Vice Consul Judson, who died 
   here suddenly on the 8th inst. It would appear that
   Mr. Judson went to the government office to get a
   passport to go to Cabinda, and was seized with a fit
   on the stairs. He was immediately put into a maxilla
   and sent to his house which was close by. Dr. Oliveira
   was called and did all he could for him but he died
   almost before the medicine could be had from the Chemist.
   Enclsoed you will find certificate of death.</p>

<p>     Immediately I heard of the occurrence, I went
   to the Secretary who is at present acting Governor,

   development of her colonies, especially in Africa,
   and claiming for this undertaking the making of 
   a new era in the prosperity of this large province
   of Angola, and in the civilisation of the African
   race generally.</p>

<p> The line passes through districts alternating
   between large tracts of prairie wooded hills, and
   fertile valleys watered by rivers and streams.
   The country about the margins of these rivers is
   already cultivated both by natives and Europeans,
   and produces fruit in abundance, vegetables,
   sweet potates, and large quantities of sugar cane.
   With the facilities now offered by the Railway for
   the carriage of machinery and materials for 
   building purposes there is every prospect in the
   near future of the large tracts of uncultivated
   land being made to yield their quota of agricultural
   produce.</p>

<p> There are proofs at hand of the utilizing of
   this entreprise to the commercial community
   generally, and to the agriculturist in the interior.</p>

<p> Large quantities of coffeeare stored in the
   district of Bayengo, owing to the wnat of carriers.
   Thus the produce is tied to the serious loss of
                                                both</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20034.jpg"/>

<p>both agriculturists and merchants here. The
   coffee market in Europe is much better now than
   it has been for several months, but the merchants
   here are simply debaned from taking advantage 
   of it, as they cannot get the coffee off the plantation
   and in the meantime they not only lose a good
   market, but interest is running on the Capital
   so locked up. If the Railway were completed
   to this district, all such risks would be
   completely done away with.</p>

<p> If now that they have commenced, they will
   go ahead and crry the line to completion as quickly
   as possible, the prosperity of the province would be
   assured. They have however, a rather difficult
   country to go through before they reach Ambasa,
   and there is not much prospect of the line being
   completed within these years.</p>

<p>     A train runs from Loanda daily over
   the open sections, and the natives are already
   beginning to make use of it.</p>

<p>Honorable Q.L. Rives
    Assistant Secretary of State
      Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
        I have the honor to 
   acknowledge the receipt of two
   dispathes from the Department
   Nos 19, 19, and dated October 2,
   the former requesting one to <unclear/>
   my duteis as Vice Consul of the 
   United States at this <unclear/> in
   accordance with my appointment
   dated October 17, 1868, which
   I have mch pleasure in doing,
   and as I did as in the interest of
   the government on the 8th of
   November after Mr. Judson's
   death, as already advised to the
   Department, I shall date my 
   resumption of duties from that
   day.</p>

<p>                         With</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30002.jpg"/>

<p>With reference to Dispatch No 20
   I am unable to give a satisfactory
   solution, Mr. Judson having died
   as stated on the 8th November, and
   on taking charge I found all-
   Consular affairs in the utmost 
   confusion. I found copies of
   some letters to the Department etc
   on loose sheets of paper, but nothing
   has been copied into any Book
   since Mr. Downing left, and I can 
   find no copies of accounts of any
   kind, or anything that will enable
   me to clear up the items you refer
   to. There is a pencil note referring
   to a flag staf, and a large stand
   for Archives, which do not wish. As
   for a flag staff I know personally
   that such a thing was never <unclear/>
   on the dwelling occupied by Mr.
   Downing and subsequently by Mr.
   Judson.</p>

<p> I forwardd to the Department a
   complete inventory of what I consider
   as belonging to the Consulate and
                                which</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30003.jpg"/>

<p>which I have removed to my office
   and put into as good order as possible.</p>

<p> No Official paper nor flag exist,
   and I am afraid I shall find myself
   short of many useful forms. Every-
   thing I found in the greatest disorder,
   many forms being being entirely spoilt by
   want of care, and others eaten but
   white ant and other insects that 
   destroy such things in this climate.</p>

<p> Neither Mr. Downing nor Mr. 
   Judson have kept up the credit of
   the nation they had the honor to
   represent, the former having done
   all he could to damage the credit
   of any future Consul who may be
   appointed to Loanda, as no one here
   will now take a draft drawn by
   an American Consul.</p>

<p> The draft drawn by Mr. Downing
   on the Department in favor of Messrs:
   Newton, Carnegie & Co for $244. 12/100
   and now in the hands of F. A. Silva
   of Charlestown, and which has 
   not been paid, was cashed by
                                my</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30004.jpg"/>

<p>my <unclear/> out of pity as Mr. Downing
   had no money to pay for board
   and lodging and would have been
   obliged to leave the hotel, and
   it secures to me unfair that a 
   draft for the same amount and 
   learning the same date in favor
   of Mr. Mr. Donald should have 
   been preferred and paid. The
   other draft for $262. 00/100 which has
   been paid, was cashed to allow
   him to pay fr hire of furniture
   house rent and Doctor's Bill to
   enable him to leave this place,
   but I since paid he has paid some
   of these debts.</p>

<p> With reference to Mr. Baines,
   his nomination would have been
   of now. effect as he has since become
   bankrupt and has left the country.</p>

<p> When Mr. Downing came here
   from Liverpool he drew on my time
   a draft for his passage money £35
   without any advice, and without 
   any knowlege of or acquaintance</p>

<p>                            with</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30005.jpg"/>

<p>with my firm, or my firm <unclear/>
   which shows he had us conscience
   where money was conscrued. </p>

<p> In your dispatch to Mr. Judson
   also dated October 2, you say
   Mr. Downing states he had a 
   verbal argument with him to
   draw the salary having given
   Judson an equivalent. This I
   believe was not the case, as I
   was led to understand that Mr.
   Judson paid him a certain amount
   for the right to draw the salary.</p>

<p> I also know that Mr. Downing
   tried to make similar arrangements
   with another party here best did
   not succeed.</p>

<p> As for Mr. Judson he has 
   never been well received by
   the Portuguese. He was fond of
   low company, wining after with
   the lower classes and convicts and
   drinking with them.</p>

<p> Here $151 28/100 for furniture and
   flag staff I have already explained
                                  that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30006.jpg"/>

<p> that wove of these articles exist.
   Hass. $147: 68/100. I have seen
   Mr. Quadris who seized the archives
   and who says Mr. Judson promised
   to pay hi but never did so, so I 
   cannot see that his draft is justifiable.
   Hass. $158 48/100 for relief of destitute
   <unclear/>. I can give no explanation 
   of this as I can find no document 
   relating to it. I only know that 
   he had one or two sick sailors in
   charge for some time</p>

<p> With refrence to the dispatch
   to Mr. Judson relative to the <unclear/>
   John Hass I can give no explanation
   as I see nothing in the archives
   referring to it.</p>

<p> I have notified to the acting
   Governor General my resumption
   of the duties of the Consulate, also
   in his reply expresses his great
   satisifaction that the Consulate of 
   the United States of America will
   resume it regular functions in the
   hands of one who knows how to
                            maintain</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30007.jpg"/>

<p>maintain the dignity of the country
   he represents.</p>

<p>   As I have no record of prior
   dispatches of Mr. Judson's I cannot
   follow on his numbers, I commenced
   therefore on November 15, last,
   at No. 1</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be

<p>Honorable Q.L. Rives,
    Assistant Secretary of State,
     Washignton, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to transmit
   to the Department the Inventory
   of the private effects of the lake Mr.-
   Judson which I value at abobut
   $100. 00/100 to $120. 00/100 if sold here.</p>

<p>    His debts, as far as I can find
   and through an advertisement I 
   put in the papers here, are as
   follows:</p>

<p>Arias Tousera & Co. for food $26 30/100
   Restaurant Club      liquors 39 05/100
   Tailor                       2 93/100
   Rest of Consulate            52 18/100</p>

<p>     Being for months April and May, not
        paid, also for October and November
        Funeral expenses        84 35/100
        I think the rest of the Consulate
                                    and</p>

 <pb facs="ViewScan_30009.jpg"/>

<p>and the funeral expenses (paid by
   me) ought to be repaid to me by the
   Department, the house having been
   ranked in the name of the govern-
   -ment, and i having assumed
   the responsibility of the burial,
   however I await the reply of the 
   Department authorizing me to draw 
   for the same</p>

<p> A Mr. Steele has presented
   himself from Cabinda, as co-manager
   with Mr. Judson of Bishop Father's
   mission there, Mr. Judson having 
   been superintendent of same. They
   were also engaged in a small business
   there together. Mr. Mc Leau of
   Bishop Taylor's mission here, certifies
   to the aboce description of Mr. Steele
   and as he has a better opportunity
   of selling the effects for better prices
   there than we can get here, I <unclear/>
   handing over to him such effects for
   sale, he guaranteeing to hand to me 
   the proceeds, as sold.   I hope I
   have done right in this as I am
                                afraid</p>

 <pb facs="ViewScan_300010.jpg"/>

<p>afraid if I were to sell them here
   they would not bring the valve I
   have placed on them as old clothes.</p>

<p> A wooden lion also exists
   belonging to a sailor of an American
   whaler, name unknown, also a 
   tin hunk masks No 5, supposed
   to have been left by a man named 
   Cameron when on a journey into 
   the interior, and not yet claimed,
   contents as per inventory.</p>

<p> I can find an account book
   or letter book to show if any money
   is owing to him, or if he had any 
   account with any one here, and
   no one has offered to pay me any-
   thing on his account in response

   St. Paul de Loanda and I crave Your Excellency's
   kind attention to my request and to the facts
   as follows.</p>

<p>     I have been in St. Paul de Loanda
   upwards of four years with Messieurs Newton
   Carnegie <unclear/>, Merchants of that city and left
   in March last on account of the health, and
                                           not</p>

<p>         When passing the Cape de Verde
   Islands I had the pleasure of meeting the
   American Consul there at (St. Thiago) who
   hold we he had suffered greatly of late
   through fevers, and did not feel at all satisfied
   and desired to leave as soon as possible
   should this be the case I may say that
   Your Excellency could rely upon my faithfully
   fulfilling the duties of that post, I being
   thoroughly conversant with the Portuguese
   language, and well acquainted with the
   inhabitants of that Island, and where are
                                         very</p>

<p>very desirous of going if possible</p>

<p>        During my stay with Messieurs

   Robert Scott Newton's supervision.</p>

<p>         It has long been my earnest
   desire to serve teh American government and
   should Your Excellency deem it advisable to
   grant we an appointment at S Thiago or 
   any other port. I can only say that I
   shall always have the itnerestes of the
   government at heart, and endeavor in every
   way to prove myself worthy of the honor, conferred
   upon us.           I am 25 years of age, and
   should Your Excellency desire a personal
   interview I shall be only too happy to cross
   the Atlantic whenever Your Excellency may

<p>Honorable
            Assistant Secretary of State
             Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Sir:
       In reply to the circular from
   the Department, dated November 25,
   I have the honor to report:
   14. There are no refirgerators
   in this Consular district.
   2nd. Being unacquainted with 
   the construction of them or their
   operation under different conditions,
   I cannot say if any peculiar
   feature would be requisite for
   this district, unless it might be 
   that the machine ought to be an
   ice-making one and refrigerator
   combined.</p>

<p>3rd Answered in first paragraph
   4th
   5th There are a few, not more
                           three</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_400013.jpg"/>

<p>three or four small French ice-
   machines in use here, and not 
   one of them is capable of turning
   out more than may be, two or
   three kilos of ice per day. They
   are seldom put to such use however,
   the cooling of water being the
   usual content of their services.</p>

<p> I have no idea what the charge
   would be per 100$ of ice if that
   quantity could be produced here
   for sale. I can however say that
   for about a quart of lemonade
   made of lime-juice, sugar and
   this machine cooled water a charge
   of thrity cents is made. Value of lime
                            juice and sugar
                            5 cents.</p>

<p> A machine turning out 1006
   200 kilos of block-ice per day.
   (refrigerator combined) would
   meet the present wants of this city.</p>

<p> The principal hotel proprietor
   of the place. Mr. F. Frugier, is 
   anxious to purchase such a
   machine, but not at prompt
   payment, as his capital is very,
                            limited</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40014.jpg"/>

<p>limited. He suggests payment of
   aertain proportion on delivery
   and rest by instalments.</p>

<p> I would suggest that catalogues
   with designs be forwarded to me, 
   stating price, cost of working
   to produce 100 to 200 kilos of ice,
   and in fact such necessary
   particulars as will enable me 
   to lay the matter clear before
   people who might become purchasers.</p>

<p> Here are no means here of
   preserving food and liquids
   and if the cost does not bar the
   way, the introduction of refrigerators
   would be a boon to marry, as meat
   turns bad here in twenty four hours.</p>

<p>Honorable W.F. Wharton
              Assistant Secretary of State,
                Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to acknowledge
   the receipt of your dispatch dated
   September 11, 1890, enclosing a copy 
   of a letter from Mrs. Adelaide W
   Holmes to the Department of
   State in which that lady claims
   the sum of <unclear/> 360.00 for property
   belonging to her late husband
   and alleged by her to have been 
   robbed from the Cabin of the Barque
   "Sea Fox" (of which need be was
   Captain) when the arrived in Loanda
   and was placed in the charge of the 
   officials  of the Port- This claim she
   makes on teh ground of the inefficiency
   on neglect of the Consul at
   Loanda.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40023.jpg"/>

<p>The whole of the sad circumstances
   attending teh explosion on board
   the vessel in question were reported
   at the time by Vice Consul Newton
   confine my reply, to the allegations
   contained in the claim set fort.</p>

<p>1st "That with the assistance"
   "of a Portuguese national vessel"
   "their <unclear/> in or near Equinina"
   "the "Sea Fox" was taken to St. Paul"
   "de Loanda."</p>

<p>   The Portuguese national
   vessel took a number of burnt
   and wounded men to Loanda
   but had nothing to do with taking
   the ship there. The Vice Consul
   sent a man by the Earliest opportunity
   to bring her to this port.</p>

<p>2nd "That at the instance of said"
   "consul or through his agency, Customs"
   "officers were part on board the said"
   " "Sea Fox"</p>

<p>     The Customs officers were sent
   on board by the Drector of Customs
                                   as</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40024.jpg"/>

<p>verifying the truth of such 
   alleged conversation. Considering
   however teh character of Mr.
   Newton, the conscientious manner
   in which he performed the duties
   of this Consulate for a period
   extending over twenty years as
   I gather from the archives, and
   his willingness at all times to
   assist in getting justice done
   even where he is not personally
   concerned, confirm me in the
   opinion that either the whole
   truth regarding such reply of
   his as alleged, is suppressed, or
   that it is entirely imaginary
   on nthe part of Captain Luce
   or whoever is responsible
   for the statement.</p>

<p> To establish the claim I again
   submit that it is necessary
   for the claimant to produce
   the list "as scheduled by the
   "Consul or his guest" duly
   authenticated by the signature
                               of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40025.jpg"/>

<p>of such COnsul or agent; and 
   in conclusion would ask if 
   the COnsul is responsible to the
   owners for safe delivery of property
   from the time their agent takes
   change in a foreign port until 
   he delivers such property in the
   home port. If any robbery was 
   committed it may have been
   done in such interval.</p>

<p> I trust the Department
   will accept my assurance 
   that all the foregoing is simply
   in answer to the claim and the
   terms in whcih it is made, and
   I should regret very much if
   any single phrase should be
   construed as showing a want
   of the high respect due from 
   me to the Department.</p>

<p>     I am, Sir,
         Your most obedient
                    servant

           Ed Bannister.
                Vice Consul.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40026.jpg"/>

<p>as is done according to law in every
   case of arrival of a vessel in port,
   and the Consul has nothing whatever
   to do with such proceeding.</p>

<p>3rd "and that during the "
   "time the ship was in charge of the"
   "said officials, the Captain's <unclear/>
   "Consul or his agent, and consisting"
   "of clothing tc, tc. were stolen and"
   "taken from the ship."</p>

<p>When the vessel arrived here
   the Consul was at Mossamedes
   very ill, and teh writer acting
   for him, immediately proceeded
   on board and found the entire
   space, which had once been occupied
   by the Cabin, a black, foul smelling
   hole without a vestige of Cabin
   from side to side and from deck
   to Keelson, the result of the explosion,
   and the fire consequent thereou
   which the crew said raged for
   some time.</p>

<p>Burnt and otherwise mutilated
                        portions</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40027.jpg"/>

<p>portions of written matter,
   unrecognizable as documents
   of importance or otherwise, were 
   <unclear/> scattered about the desk
   which was shown with wreckage
   caused by the explosion. On my 
   asking if anything belonging
   to the Captain had been saved
   (simply with a view to secure
   for his friends some souvenir),
   the reply was in the following
   terms as far as my memory
   serves me, and I know that at 
   the time if made a great impression
   on me,considering the awful
   circumstances: "My God
   Sir, do you think any one thoguth
   of anything else when he recovered
   from the shock but putting
   out the fire and saving the
   ship from going right down
   unders"</p>

<p> There remained more than
   20 men of the crew, and they
   demanded to be taken ashore</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40028.jpg"/>

<p>and provided for. I had to
   make provision for them (they
   had neither food nor place to 
   sleep in), and also provide
   for the ship's safety and that
   of her cargo. The man who 
   brought the vessel from Equinina
   said he would not have gone
   for her if he had known what
   he would have to put up with.
   He had to sleep (when he could)
   on the open deck, there was 
   no food except a little fish
   and sweet potatoes, and when
   he arrived here he was in a
   high state of fever.</p>

<p> I would ask respectfully
   if under such circumstances
   the Council's duty was to hurt
   up a few trinkets or other articles
   (which I am firmly convinced
   did not exist), or do his duty
   by the ship, her cargo and the crew?</p>

<p>"The Captain's entire effects"
                            previously</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40029.jpg"/>

<p>"previously scheduled by the"
   "Consul or his agent."</p>

<p>    I will refrain from making
   any comment on this assertion,
   but respectfully ask the Department
   to demand from the concocters
   of this claim the list of effects
   "scheduled by the Consul or
   his agent" with the signature
   of the Consul, or his agent attached.
    4th. "And that upon representation"
   "of the robbery being made to the 
   "Consul by the Captain who had"
   "been sent to St Pual de Loanda"
   "to bring the ship to her home"
   "port, the Consul replied that"
   " "nothing could he done about"
   " "it".</p>

<p>     This of course implies that
   a list as set forth in the clai
   and "as scheduled by the Consul"
   "or his agent" really existed. Let
   them produce it.     In the
   absence of Mr. Newton, late 
   Vice Consul, I have no means of

<p>Sir:
     In compliance with
   the instructions conveyed
   in the Circular dated 20
   September 1890. I have the 
   honor to transmit herewith
   a 'Report on the production
   of Crude India Rubber" in the 
   Province of Angola and
   its dependencies.</p>

<p> The delay in forwarding
   it is owing to want of quick
   communication with the
   sources of information, and 
   certain difficulty in getting
   at statistics.</p>

<p>Sir:
   As suggested by you, I have written a brief
   Report on the need and possibility of direct
   steam communication between the United 
   States and Africa. This report i enclose No. 7,

   question of encouraging the formation of
   a line of steamer to Africa.</p>

<p> With the report I also enclose biogra- No.2

   the credit to be given to the information con-
   tained in the report, and the opinion
   of Mr. Stanely on trading between the U. -No. 3

<p>No. 1 Report
   on the need of direct steam com-
   munication between the United States
            and Africa.
                I
            General Facts and Conclusions
   (1) The industry and commerce of the U.
       S. need: (a) raw material for the fac-
       tories (b) a market for the overproduc-
       tion of manufactures.</p>

<p>(2) A look at Africa's extent and un-
       tapped resources from that it will be,
       in the near future, the greatest producer
       of raw material, the greatest consumer
       of foreign manufacturers, and the best field
       for skilled labor.</p>

<p>(3) The U.S. had the advantage over
       any other nation in its possibilities as
       a consumer of African produce and a pro-
       ducer of material needed for the upbuilidng
       of Afric's civilization.
   (4) Geographically, the distance between
       the U.S. and W. Africa (south of the
       Sahara) is not greater then that between</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50007.jpg"/>

<p>England or Germany and West Africa.
   Nor are the Cape Verde Islands any
   farther removed from teh U.S. than
   are England and Germany.</p>

<p>(5) Within five or six years the tarnage
       between Engalnd, Germany, Portugal,
       and W. Africa has more than dobuled,
       while France & Belgium, and also
       private frims, leave added new lines
       to said coast.</p>

<p>(6) The U.S. shipping its <unclear/> Africa, which
       was considerable <unclear/> the river, has
       steadily decreased, solely because steam
       has not been added to sail, and
       because other lines from Europe have 
       been allowed to draw the trade
       over the doubly long route of England
       and Germany.</p>

<p>(7) The present exchange of productions
       and movement of passengers between
       American and Africa, including what
       goes via England, Portugal and Ger-
       many would suffice to warrant the
       establishment of a modern line of stea-
       mers, but the best would follow it <unclear/>-
       <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50008.jpg"/>

<p>(8) At present it takes letters from
       Angola and Congo from six to eight
       weeks to reach New York. A line
       of steamers going direct to Cape Verde
       Islands, and thence down the Coast
       at the average rate of trading steamers
       would used Liberia in a fortnight
       and the Congo and Angola in eight
       to twelve days more; that is in
       half the time now required.</p>

<p>                II
              Personal observations
    (1) I have sailed, or rather steamed, 
        four times along the West Coast of
        Africa, seeing all points of any im-
        portance between. Madura and
        Messemedes, at the southern extremity 
        of Angola. Never had I a chance to
        travel on an Aerican trading vessel:
        the first <unclear/> voyage I made
        (in 85) by the British and African S.S.
        Line, the recent on the U.S.S.
       "<unclear/>"; the first northward trip
        I made on Portuguese <unclear/> of war
        "Africa" and the second on the Port-</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50009.jpg"/>

<p>guese packet to St. Vincent (Postgrande)
   and thence by transf-steamer to Philadelphia
   The first voyage from Liverppol to Loanda
   took almost eight weeks. The last voyage
   from Loanda to Philadelphia took
   twenty one days; exclusice of 5 days stop-
   page at S. Thomé and three days at St. Vincent.</p>

<p> My mission being scientific and objective
   only such commerical facts as forced
   themselves on me were noticed and 
   can now be collected. A special study
   would <unclear/> much more hopeful in-
   dications.</p>

<p>(2) The Cape Verde Islands
       At St. Vincent, Mr. Randall, father,
       who was a long time U.S. Consular Agt
       remember the time when Port Grande
       was a miserable tremble of fisher-huts
       Now it is a large town and one of the 
       guest portions of the world. Nearly all
       the houses are covered in shingles, and
       these as wellas teh timber come from 
       America.</p>

<p> Here the bark of Mr. <unclear/> of Boston,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50010.jpg"/>

<p>of Mr. H. Mitchell, N.Y. and probably
   that of Yates in Porterfield, touch
   at regular intervals on their way to
   Dakar, Goree and Sierra Leone.</p>

<p> The Cape Verde Islanders, as many 
   of them told me, are more American
   than Portuguese. Every man, who gets
   a chance, wants to see the U.S.A
   great many are U.S. citizens, having 
   been nationalized as sailor on American
   vessels.  I know of a sailing vessel that
   salled Brava and got there a
   full cargo of passengers at 50 dollars.
   A direct line of steamers can reckon
   on a regular suppoly of passengers to 
   and from the U.S. and Cape Verde Islands.
   As a winter <unclear/> soe of these Island
   will soon vie with Madura, the <unclear/>
   and the <uncear/>. Americans would no
   doubt soon prefer them to Madura at
   the <unclear/>.</p>

<p>The reports of the U.S. Consul at San-
   tiago ought to show that htere is now 
   some direct and indirect effort from
   Cape Verde Islands to the U.S.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50011.jpg"/>

<p>(3) Senegambia and Sierra Leone
        One <unclear/> mentioned American firms
       are constantly sending there some bark
       and I suppose the Department is better
       informed than I on the business they 
       do.</p>
<p>(4) Liberia
        The connection of this colony of ours
       with the motherland and European
       nations is too well known for me
       to dwell on it. Liberia alon would 
       furnish enough passnegers and freight
       movement to support a small steamer
       and many others to follow, of the 
       custom barrier between mother and  
       daughter were lowered.</p>

<p>(5) Gold-Coast, Niger, Cameroons,
       Gabon, S. Thomé, and Congo
        When I have been, at all
       points of the Coast and Islands I
       have found the same desire of
       traders wishing to get goods direct
       from America, <unclear/> shipping produce
       in the same way, and of educated
       nations wishing to get passage to the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50012.jpg"/>

<p>"big country", not to settle then, but
   to learn its ways.</p>

<p> There is no conception in America
   of the immense resources of all 
   kinds stood up in those regions, nor 
   of the mysterious, magnet like, <unclear/> of attraction
   this republic exerts on the minds of
   Africans the moment they emerge from
   tribal isolation. </p>

<p>(6) Angola
         In this province, which is regularly
        visited by the monthly lines of Germany 
        and France, the tri-weekly of England,
        and the bi-weekly of Portugal, the 
        need of direct steam communication
        with the U.S. seems to be realized 
        with the clearest consciousness, especially
        since the recent troubles with England.</p>

<p>     One Jewish friend charting way your
        a few sailing vessels to bring lumber,
        kerosene, flour, furniture etc. from
        the States and the profits it realizes 
        are larger than it is willing to confess.
        The Schooner Horace Leudder  that
        used to visit all ports of Angola</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50013.jpg"/>

<p>yearly, will a mixed cargo of American 
   goods, has been greatly missed for this
   last few years. A whole batch of
   traders used planters are already now
   writing to me of their intention to visit
   the Chicago Fair and to see with
   with their own eyes how best to establish
   and extend direct commercial relations
   with this country.</p>

<p> As soon as I read my post, I
   hope to be able to give exact statistics
   of the important agriculture and trade
   and of the immense resources of that
   large province.</p>

<p>(7) Cape Colony (and South African
       Republics
        Considering that the water route
       between the U.S. and the Cape and
       are practically equal, there is no
       reason why this country could not
       compete on that <unclear/> market
       in all those articles in which it
       does compete in Europe.</p>

<p> Nor should the deep sympathy</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50014.jpg"/>

<p>between the coming United States
   of South-Africa and their model
   on this hemisphere or forgotten.</p>

<p>(8) Summing my observation
    on all the West-Coast I may state
    (a) that all this lumber, kerosene
      flour, and canned meats that is used
       on the West-Coast comes directly or
       indirectly from America.
        Lately, however, Norwegia is has begun to <unclear/>
       compete with America in the lumber
       trade.</p>

<p> (b) In cotton-goods (which form the
        most important article of importation
        in Africa), preserved fruit and meats
        (especially corned beef and salt pork)
        in machinery for agriculture, tools
        and implements of all kinds, rolling
        stock for <unclear/>, cheap clock and
        watches cheap furniture, notion
        and intention of all kinds, patent
        mediums, etc. the United States
        can compete with other nations as
        soon as the goods have not to
        travel over England and Germany.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50015.jpg"/>

<p> (c) The main produce of Africa, as it
       is now, india-rubber, ivory, pea-nuts,
       skins, wax, dye stuffs, ginger, cain-
       wood, coffee, cocoa, kola-nuts & fibres, etc.
       are all wanted in the U.S. as much
       as in Europe.
        Whether palm-oil would find here
       as good a market as in Europe. I
       cannot say but I don't see why it
       should not.</p>

<p> (d) As to the quantity its sufficiency is formed by the fact that
       steamers have rapidly increased in
       size and number so that now there
       are ten regular lines of steamer, <unclear/>
       a number belonging <unclear/> trading firms
       when six or seven years ago there
       was only the English line with
       the then modest beginnings of the
       now powerful German line.</p>

<p> (g) American missionaries in Africa,
       Exclusive of the United Presbyterian
      in Egypt, who would never use
      the African lines, there are now
      in Africa American missionaries
      representing 18 religious organizations</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50016.jpg"/>

<p>1. The united Brethren, with their prosperous,
      Colony-like mission<unclear/> the Mende
      of Sierra Leone.
   2. The Kansas Soudan Mission of the Y.M.C.A's,
      with coast-station as Sierra Leone
   3. Wesleyan Methodists as Sierra Leone
   4. Free Methodists in Sierra Leone, and
      Liberia, and East-Coast and going to expand to Congo
      and other parts.
   5. African Methodist Episcopal in 
      Liberia
   6. Methodist Episcopal in Liberia, Congo,
      Angola.
   7. Protestant Episcopal in Liberia 
   8. Lutherans in Liberia 
   9. Mormonites in Liberia.
  10. Southern Baptists in Yorubaland
  11. Northern Presbyterians in German
      Cameroons, and French Gabon and
      Spanish <unclear/>.
  12. Southern Presbyterian on Congo
  13. Northern Baptists on Congo
  14. Christian Alliance on Congo
  15. American Board in Angola, and
        <unclear/>-Africa, and Zululand</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50017.jpg"/>

<p>16. Swedish Lutherans on Congo.
   17. Friends in Madagascar
   18. Roman Catholics, in different fields.
         To these should be added a 
      number independent missionaries.
      The total number of these missionaries
      is set down as 204; but it is really
      considerably higher, for the women 
      are not included in that <unclear/>.
      These American missionaries are 
      assisted in their work by more than
      600 nothing evangelists. The money
      expended on these American and nature mission
      aries is more than 250, 000 x 00
      per year.</p>
   
<p>   There are enough indication to make
    it almost certain That next year
    will see an unprecedented much of
    American missionaries to African so
    that the above number will soon
    be doubled and trebled.</p>
   
<p>   Now, almost to a man, these mission
    aries with their familes travel via
    England and bring their outfit and
    that of their stations in Europe,
    simply because there is no direct
    line of steamers</p>

<p>No. 9b U.S. Commercial Agency
         at St. Paul de Loanda,
          Lisbon, July 24, 1891</p>
   
<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain
   to the Hon. William F. Wharton
      Assistant Secretary of State
               Washington, D.C.</p>
   
<p>Sir:
   I have teh honor to report my
   arrival at this port, <unclear/> to
   St. Paul de loanda, and to men
   tion some of the difficulties met on this route.</p>
   
<p>1) The shortest,o r rather quickets,
      route to Angola (St. Paul de Loanda)
      is that of the Portuguese mail,
      provided one is able to find suitable
      communication between England and</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50024.jpg"/>
   
<p>Portugal. I had read of the project,
   or decision, of having steamers sail
   from Lisbon to Loanda on the 21st
   and 6th of each month; but not being
   sure, I determined to inquire in
   New York. Here teh Portuguese Consul
   knows only of the departures on the 6th;
   book's Agency iden. I sailed to 
   Engalnd by first opportunity in
   order to find out there, both about
   the Lisbon packets for Loanda and
   the steamers from England to Loanda.
   2) In England I learnt that there 
    is indeed a steamer leaving Lisbon
    on the 21st and there I might
    catch it by one of the Southampton
    steamer, all of whom were due in Lisbon
    about the some time.
   3) The time for the connection being</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50025.jpg"/>
   
<p>very limited, and the required
   custom house despatches and visas
   of Passport taking to much time,
   the steamer of the 21st was missed
   and I must wait for the next 
   one of the 6th of August, which is
   due in Loanda about the <unclear/> of
   September.</p>
   
<p>Besides the visa of the American
   Consulate I was obliged to get
   another from the Police fo teh Port
   which cost 2.800 <unclear/> that
   is a little over three dollars. My
   baggage had to go through the same
   process as that of non-consuls, and
   I found that Portuguese officials think
   a Commercial Agent is nothing more
   than a Consular Agent.</p>
   
<p>The result of my experience is that</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50026.jpg"/>
   
<p>although the British and African lines
   from Liverpool to Loanda is not the 
   most direct nor the quickest in
   theory (in the time actually sepnt
   at sea) yet it is the most con

      I have teh honor to enclose the Report
    on U.S. Coaling stations in Africa
    referred to in our interview when I 
    left Washington, and to beg you to trans

   are most desirable as coaling-stations
   and may possibly be acquired by 
   the United States.</p>

 <p>Enclosure no. 1
   Report on U.S. Coaling-stations
   in Africa, their desirability,
   possibly and suitable points.</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50031.jpg"/>
   
<p>Report
   on Coaling-stations in Africa.</p>
   
<p>(1) The desirability of coaling stations
     for the U.S. Naby on several points
     of Africa is best understood, no
     doubt, by the Navy Department, and
     needs not to be <unclear/> upon.</p>
   
<p>(2) Some of the desirable, and prob
      ably acquirable, points are the following:
       a)Fayal, or some other point on 
         one of the Azores.-The whole popul
         ation of the Azores would rejoice to
         see the U.S. acquire some land in 
         their islands, and the Portuguese gov
         ernment might not object persistant
         ly in the present state of affairs
       b)Some part of the Cape Verde Islands,
        where the whole population is also</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50032.jpg"/>
   
<p>most favorably disposed toward the
   United States.
   (c) An island, or the whole, of Portuguese
      Guinea. The sale or abandonment of 
      this colony, which has given Portugal noth
      ing but trouble and expense, has often
      been demanded by Portuguese statesmen
      even when the national finances were
      in a relatively flourishing condition.
      If anything could be got for for it, there
      is little doubt that the Portuguese govern
      ment and "Cortes would hail with
      joy an honorable opportunity of
      parting with that <unlcear/> colonial
      appendage. Under American admin
      istration there would need be no fear of 
      rebellions kuje tgat wgugc the Portu
      guese here recently had to deal with.
      I think that possessions is both the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50033.jpg"/>
   
<p>most promising for a good administrat
   ion, and the one that can be obtained
   on the most favorable terms. The Navy 
   Department is the best judge of its
   excellency as for a geographical
   situation and anchorage are concerned
   The climate is, whatever some may
   say,not a bit worse than that of 
   the British and French possessions
   to the north and south of it.
   d) Some land might be obtained
      on the Principe and St. Thomas Islands,
      but Cabinda, just north of the
      Congo, mouth, is by far the most
      desirable point of the whole coast
      and could probably be acquired
      either as a whole or, at least, in
      part. Portugal has already spent
      more money on it than it is worth</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_50034.jpg"/>
   
<p>to a nation that holds so much
   valuable lands, and there is no pros-
   pect of Portugal extending is as
   the expense of either the Congo State
   or France. The American fleet of <unclear/>
   vessels has for many years make
   Cabinda this gathering point, and
   the sea-faring Cabindas are well
   acquainted with American ships.</p>

<p>     This concludes the list of the
   available plan under the Portuguese
   flag and instated on the West-Coast
   I know from <unclear/> friends con-
   nected with more Portuguese states.
   <unclear/> and from the discussion of
   the subject in the "Cortes" that
   the best solution ,(if a solution be
   possible) of the <unclear/> financial
   crisis would be found in these</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50035.jpg"/>

<p>sale of superfluous colonies or terri-
   tories, and that the United States
   would have the preferences. Only
   it is considered inconsistent with
   the national dignity to make the
   first other. But overtures of the
   U.S. on this subject would be wel-
   comed, and the mission of Sr. Arroyo
   to the U.S. for other objects could
   be utilised for negotiations of this 
   sort.</p>

<p> It does not look as though there
   would be any insuperable difficulty
   in obtaining from the Portuguese
   some harbor of their East-African
   possession.</p>

<p> e) Of the Spanish posession in
      West-Africa, which have no prom-
      ising future before them unless they</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50036.jpg"/>

<p>fall into better hands, a point of
   Fernando Po might be ceded to the 
   U.S. as well as to Germany, who
   already has a coaling station on that
   large island. But Corises, and Benito where
   the missionaries of the American
   Presbyterian Church (North) have been,
   and still are, the only pioneers of
   civilization and Christianity, and where
   important congregation of converted
   have already been gathered, would
   seem to be every way a more bearable
   site. The island of Anno Bom,
   too whose most regular <unclear/> 
   our American whaling ships, and
   which is to Spain a more source
   of expense, might prove to be a 
   good place for the object in view.
    f) Finally Liberia, our world</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50037.jpg"/>

<p>and the light-house of the rising
   African (native) states, would probab-
   ly welcome the moral support wwhich
   the pressure of a U.S. coating station
   would offer it. Still, some of the
   preceding points seem to be preferable,
   principally Portuguese Guinea (Bisseau
   and <unclear/>) Cabinda or Corisco.</p>

<p>  The present crisis or Portugal
   which cannot last long, at least
   in this acute stage, often the
   best, and possibly the last,
   opportunity for the acquisition
   of desirable points for coaling-
   stations on the route from America
   to Europe (Azores) South Africa,
   India and Australia. One 
   of the Azores, Portuguese Guinea
   and Cabinda would form a</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50038.jpg"/>

<p>splendid <unclear/> both for our
   navy and our coming merchant
   navy to Africa.</p>

<p>   I shall gladly furnish any
   more information that may be
   desired on the subject of this
   report, and past my personal
   influence with the Portuguese, and
   fearlessness of African climate, at 
   the disposal of our government 
   for the attainment of the objects 
   in question.</p>

<p>No. 10
         Consulate of the United States,
        at St. Paul de Loanda, Sept 1st, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
             Assistant Secretary of State,
                                    Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
       I have the honor to inform you
    that I arrived at my post yesterday
    Aug. 31st by S.S. Ambaca exact
    ly 62 days after sailing from New 
    York and that I have taken charge
    of this Consulate to-day.</p>

<p>   The Governor General of Angola had
    already announced my appointment
    and permission to act in the official
    Bulletin of Aug. 22nd.</p>

<p> The archives of the Consulate were trans
   ferred to me by Vice-Consul Ed. Ban
   nister, and we have together made the
   enclosed inventory of the same accor
   ding to the directions contained in the Con
   sular Regulations.</p>

<p> Pending the choice of a definite location </p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50041.jpg"/>

<p>I have taken a temporary office at
   the house of a reliable friend. The 
   partition in Mr. Newton's office, which
   was formerly used for the U.S. Consulate
   I found already occupied by the British
   Consulate.</p>

<p> I also have to advise my drafts
   on the Hon. Secretary of the Treasury,
   one of the $82.90, for the period of in
   structions and another, of $136.99, for my
   transit, both in <unclear/> As you already know, it was
   not possibl for me to reach my
   destination wihtin the determined
   50 days, nor have my predecessor, that
   I know of, been able to do so.</p>

<p>   In spite of two years of drought and
   consequent scarcity of food, I find Loanda
   much improved and commerce flourishing
   This is due to the railroad and the 
   good prices fetched by native produce.</p>

<p>    The political crisis is becoming so
   acute, that a joint movement of Por-
   tuguese and natives for Angolan inde
   pendence is imminent nor is it prob-
   able that the Lisbon government would</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50042.jpg"/>

<p>or could seriously oppose such a
   change.      In a great meeting,
   the leading man of Loanda, irres-
   pective of party or color, have pro-
   tested against teh cession of the Lunde
   to the Congo State, and resolved to
   frustrate the permission given the
   same State to contract 500 natives
   in Angola. And they have done
   it so effectually that the Congo State
   Agent has withdrawn.</p>

<p>  The Department shall soon hear
   more on these subjects.</p>

<p> As, to my knowledge, there
   is no American Consul on the Congo,
   I take the liberty to inform the
   Department of the decease of Vivi,
   on the 12th Aug. of Christian
   Borella a native of Denmark
   and naturalized American citizens.</p>

<p> After a long cover of usefulness
   in and out of the employ of the
   New York Seamen's Missionary 
   Society, Borella sailed about
   three years ago, for Liberia Fever-</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50043.jpg"/>

<p><unclear/> he took a trip to Cape-Town,
   and <unclear/> came to Loanda, whence
   he went to the infant stations of
   Bishop Taylor's Mission. He was 
   appointed Captain of Bishop Taylor's
   steamer on the Lower Congo, and
   went there, though debilitated.
   On Aug. 10th he was seized by 
   <unclear/> fever, and on the 12th fol-
   lowing, at 4 a.m., he breathed his
   last. BIshop Taylor was with him
   on Vivi. hill, and nursed him; but
   in vain.</p>

<p>  Living and traveling at his own
   expense, full of love to all man,
   humble, studious and hardworking,
   Christian Borella was cherished
   wherever he went, his death and will be
   lamented by many,in Africa as
   well as in New-York.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have to acknowledge the receipt of instructions
   no 7. stating that any report on direct steam
   communication with W. Africa had been received
   and copy transmitted to Postmaster General.
    I have also received the circulars, dated
   June, 20, 23, 26, 17, 25, july 1, 14, and 
   duly noted contents; I will answer the
   queries made in two of them, as soon as

<p>   As the officials and people here constantly

   changed to that of Consul as soon as possible.</p>

<p>    From a letter of the Treasury Department

   lowed ninety days salary for period of 
   transit. Based on this precedent, if <unclear/>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60004.jpg"/>

<p>Report on present State
   and Needs of U.S. Consulate at
       St. Paul de Loanda</p>

<p>From the Inventory sent last march, The Dep
   artment, could infer, to some extent, what this
   Consulate has and what it lacks; but a de
   tailed report on the present state and needs
   of the Consulate is merely not out of place.</p>

<p>1) The Office
        This used to be in Mr. Newton's office, in 
   a corner partitioned off by a common wall about
   8 feet high, and when I took charge, That corner
   had been evaluated in favor of the British
   Consul (newly appointed) and the U.S. archives
   were piled up in Mr. Newton's business office.</p>

<p> As the Department probably known, Mr.
   Newton has retired to Europe and his business
   here is in charge of clerk. Mr. Ed Ban
   nister is no longer connected with Mr. Newton's
   firm. Whether the two Consular archives, American
   and British, and to be kept in thesame room
   or partition, I am not sure of, but think they
   were.</p>

<p>     Until a better place can be found, I
   have hired two room as the American 
   Mission, me myself. The other for office</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60005.jpg"/>

<p>The letter is on the ground-floor, has a door
   to the point front of the house, and another door opening 
   into the schoolroom whcih is only used on Sundays.
   A partition will reaching to the ceiling, separates
   the office from the store-rrom of the mission.
   MY bed-room is up-staris.</p>

<p>2) The furniture
        As appears from the Inventory, nothing was 
   turned over to me but the maiden remains of
   a few chain, and two ruined book-cases, which
   letter Mr. Bannister was not sure belonged to
   the Consulate.</p>

<p>    I furnished the office with some of my own,
  and borrowed chain, table, and reparied me
  small book-case. To these I added a table
  and book shelves, which I made myself
  from old boxes. The walls I adorned with
  African and other maps of my own, so
  that the office, the poorly furnished,
  book pretty decent and comfortable.
    Consdiering, however, the rapidly grow
    ing importance of this port and the 
    nation represented at this Conslate, its 
    office should, in justice,be properly fur-
    nished. Furniture is very dear at Loanda;
    so I propose to the Department to either
    appropriate a sufficient seem to buy said</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60006.jpg"/>

<p>furniture here (counting the cost here to be
   at least 100% more than it would be in the 
   States) or to send a full supply of office 
   furniture from the States.</p>

<p> If this Consulate be henceforth part in 
   charge of decent ment, and dtailed inven
   tories required of them, the Department may
   be sure that the furniture will be properly
   cared for.</p>

<p>3) Office paraphernalia 
   Of these nothing was turned over except what
   is mentioned in the Inventor (Two stamp,
   a few waifers, sheets of paper and envelopes).
   The stamp mentioned as "handstamp" bear
   the inversification Commercial Agency" and is
   therefore no longer correct, nor is it in good con-
   dition. Letter-files needed.</p>

<p>   Just now I have received from the Deprt.
   ment a supply of forms and stationary, but 
   as ink nor string. These shall have to buy
   The press, mentioned in former inventories,
   has not been transformed and may have
   disappeared in jUsdson? time. One ought
   to be sent by first opportunity. As there is 
   no bookbinder in this place, it would seem
   admirable for the Deaprtment to send some
   material wherewith the officer might that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60007.jpg"/>

<p>himself what things require binding (and th<uncelar.
   <unclear/>. Packing paper, too, which, here, is
   rather high, should be not but not with myseflf lot.</p>

<p>4)The Archives
        a)Forms.    Of these, more than
   half were obsolete, but no mixed up, that 
   it took me several days' hard work to
   sort the antiquated from the good and
   to sort and arrange the latter.</p>

<p> The result in that the Forms lacking, even

   Newton's clerks and Bannister, to why letters and
   documents said from subjects to Department </p>

<p>There is nothing in it previous to Downing & 1888.
   The letters sent has a few writings in 1883, a few
   in 1888 and regular ones since 1889,
   The letters received contain entries since and
   of 1888
   The Two old DIspatch Books mention in Inventory

    apart from Dispatches to U.S. Departments.

<p>     As may being informed from the above the
   two latter Records were never kept, which

   it can be inferred what book may be
   lacking</p>

<p>     The Comander Reports were never taken

<p> C) Correspondence
       This I found in utmost confusion except
     the latest, sent to Bannister since he had 
     sole charge.
       It took me a long time to sort what</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60011.jpg"/>

<p>there is, and now all the letters are chrono,
   logically arranged in different packages, <unclear/>

<p> The division is:

                    (incomplete but beginning ink a few
                addressed to Anchor Libra)(2) Circular from State Dept.
                        (same remark)
                (3) Letters from Treasury Dept.
                (4) Official letters from other 
                        Consulate
                (5) Official letters from Portuguese
                        authorities 9such as on left)
                (6) Letters and documents concerning
                        crews and ships
                (7) Letters and documents concerning 
                        missions
                (8) Judson's private letters &
                        accounts (a most direspectable
                            bundle).
            Excepting Newton's and Du Verge's, though
            both incomplete, scarcely any correspondence
            has escaped.
            It is high time to bind what is left.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60012.jpg"/>

<p>5)   Flagstaff and flags.
        As stated in last mail, Newton's clerk
    said they were not sure whether the flagstaff
    belonged to Consulate or not. I chowed
    them since the letter of the Department
    authorizing Mr. Newton to spend $25.-
    on purhcases and erection of me and they
    said that did not prove that Mr. Newton
    actually got the money, and that I should
    get Mr. Bannister (now <unclear/> from
    Newton, Carnegie's) to declare whether the
    money was recieved or not. I have not
    yet been able to find Mr. Bannister 
    since that time and so the mattter is
    standing, until I see Mr. Bannister,
    when, no doubt, the matter will be satis
    factorily decided.</p>

<p>     Still, for either the removal and erection
    of trades or the purchase of a new staff, I beg
    the Department to allow me to spend,
    in first can not more than five dollars,
    and in the latter case teh maximum of
    twenty five dollars.</p>

<p>     Meanwhile, I have, on convenient occasions
   hoisted the flag on the flag staff of the 
   Mission House when the Comander office temporarily located</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60013.jpg"/>

<p>As to the flags, the boat-flag though some
   what moth-eaten will yet do for the rare occa
   sion of this port; but the large flag, already
   torn at the corners, needs being <unclear/>
   as fast as another box comes fro the De
   partment. It would be wise to send with 
   the flag some cones of <unclear/> to ward off
   insects.</p>

<p> 6)  Consular Officers
        The arranging of the consular correspond
       ence and its <unclear/> have given me, toge
       ther with what I gathered here from conver
       sations, a very fair idea of the history and 
       work of each successive Consular officer.</p>

<p>      The impression, that history leaves, is most pain
       ful for an America. Excepting Archer Libra,
       who was the most popular and generous
       trader Loanda had in this century, all the
       Americans who have held these port were fit
       for the penitentiary and the gallows rather
       than for the office of representatives of the
       United States. Of Jackson I know nothing
       as he was here but as a passenger.</p>

<p>      That the only one to maintain the dignity
       of the office in all that line, should have
       been an Englishman, Mr Newton, is rather
       humiliating; and not less humiliating</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60014.jpg"/>

<p>is the fact that he used to give teh American
   consulate openly or tacitly as part-salary to
   one of his clerk.</p>

<p> Now, as Angola is being more and more 
   occupied by American Missions, as its commercial im
   portance is fast growing, and as there is no
   doubt that are long it will form a power
   ful independent state with strong sympa
   thies for the United States, it is of the 
   highest importance, that, should should I be replaced
   from decision any other cause, the standard
   of this Consulate, which I shall have raised
   out of the mud, be never again lowered
   by sending here men who are a disgrace
   to their country and to mankind, even in darkest
   Africa.</p>

<p>  But this improvement in the personal
   of the Consulate depends shiftly on the
   Salary. While I, who have got a repu
   tation as a philanthropic Diogram can
   manage to live and do some good with my
   salary there is no doubt but that an
   ordinary man, requesting the society of the
   other consuls and Consular agents can imoi
   sibly get along with the salary of the post.
   The price for a poorly furnsihed room
   and board (two meals a day, as any one
   of the two or three better hotelsof the place so</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60015.jpg"/>

<p>2.75 per day, if taken by the week or onth,
   and the extras entailed by living in such a hotel
   make the expense of an additional 50¢ to one dollar
   per day necessary.</p>

<p> The only way for a COnsul to keep out of debt
   would be to accept a situation as clerk or to 
   go into business with some capital. Thus the
   Department in confronted with this dilemma; 
   either have a trading COnsul who will take care
   not to have American competition in the Province
   & these hinder rather than advance teh commercial
   interests he is supposed to promote, or have
   a consul, who will give his time and talents
   to the consular business, and pay him enough
   to enable him to do so. Angola, with its 600.000
   square miles of the best land in the world, and Loa
   anda, whose custom <unclear/> cleared last year, in
   writer of all struggling 550.000 $00, deserve some
   thing better than a last-class Consulate.</p>

<p>     In a city like Loanda a salary of two 
   thousand dollars should be the minimum for
   Consul for Schedule B.</p>

            and the same for the "Mercantil" another leading papers of Loanda.

<pb facs="ViewScan_60016.jpg"/>

<p>Report
   on Present Political Situation
   of Portugal & Angola.</p>

<p>     As promised in my first dispatch
   from Angola, I now lay before the Department a
   detailed account of political movements within
   my Consular District. And first of all, allow
   me to state what i noticed on the way from
   Lisbon to Loanda.</p>

<p>1) Voyage on S.S. Ambaca
     We had on board over 300 Portuguese West-Africa,
   but chiefly to Angola. This was only the first batch 
   of the crowd to foloow on the by-weekly steamers
   of the <unclear/> Nacional. The lot of the "Ambaca"
   hailed from OPorts and consisted of hungry work
   ingmen all revolutionary Republicans of whom the 
   Portuguese government was more or less afraid. As soon
   as they were on board these men showed what could
   be expected of them. The municipality of OPorts had 
   promised all the residents of OPorto a present of
   5 <unclear/> =$5.40, but when the agent began to
   distribute the money, on board the "Ambaca" and
   returned to give that amount $ those who were not
   on his list of OPorts-men, the whole crowd resolved
   & declared, they would not sail unless all got</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60017.jpg"/>

<p>the same amount. The minister of Marine ordered
   to delay the departures of the ship, as company of <unclear/>
   Marines was sent on board and the steamer was
   surrounded by tugs and launchers from the Marine
   Arrival. On the seventh however, the government de
   cided to give all men equally 5 <unclear/> and
   the "Ambaca" was allowed to sail, after a new
   company of marines had been put on board with
   a lot of ammunition.</p>

<p>     On the way out, however, it soon became evident
   that the missions were worse than the emigrants
   and during the whole voyage the <unclear/> passages
   practically rule the ship. Every time launchese went
   ashore with cargo there emigrants would simply 
   find the ship's officers aside and <unclear/>
   boats and have ajolly time ashore. If no accordance
   happened, it is due to the Captain and first class
   passenger who being all Republicans, let the 
   poor fellows have their own way.</p>

<p>     As Principe (Prince's Isld.), some of the
   emigrants walked up to a plantation where one
   of the exiled OPorts rebels is working and made 
   him an<unclear/>. There as at other places when the
   boats would bring the passengers back in the coming
   a red flag would fly on the first launch & the
   crowd would sing the "Portuguese" the new
   Portuguese Marseillance which the government</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60018.jpg"/>

<p>tried in vain to prohibit in Portugal. Rer the ship
   sailed from Principe, a big bon-fie was lit on the
   hill when the exiles' plantation his, and the immi-
   grants answered with land "vives" for the exile,
   pistol-shots and the singing of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>S. Thomé
      Here the whole white population was highly
   indignant against the Portuguese governent and
   has just held an excited masking to protest
   against following means of the government
   1) The change in the export duties by which it
   seems almost impossible to export coffee and co-
   coa direct & foreign ports, and in the import
   <unclear/> which by forcing all foreign goods to from
   through the laws of Lisbon agents creates a
   rise in the prices of next to all goods.
   2) The premium granted to the Congo State
   to contract (i.e to buy) 500 natives of Angola,
   at a time when S. Thomé a Principe cannot
   get a sufficient number of (slave) laborers for
   its coffee plantations.
   3) The Cession (as it is called) of part of the
   Loanda empire to the same Congo State.
    The population of S. Thomé & Principe whose white
   population is intimately connected with that of
   Angola is now one with the latter in the opinion</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60019.jpg"/>

<p>that the home government is the worst <unclear/> of the
   colonies and that the time in come for the latter
   to free themselves from the Lisbon magnates.</p>

<p>Kabinda
      Here I saw no sign of political excitement,
  but admired the magnificant barracks of the 
  battalions statement here and the beautiful palace
  of the governor. I talked with some of the soldiers
  and found that most of them are from the dis-
  strict of Loanda; as for back to the interior as
  Kasanji (600 miles);who were pressed into the
  service. As Kabinda they take native women,
  & so the Kabinda race is being rapidly mixed
  with the Angolan. Soon all the Kabinda women 
  (who hitherto only <unclear/> Fiste or Kongo) will
  know Kimbandu (or Angolen) which most men
  already learnt is Loanda or other orts, and vice
  verse a great number of Angolans are learning 
  Kongo so that when the day of independence
  comes, the people of Portuguese Kongo will fuel
  one with those of Angola, south of them. Unwitting-
  ly, the Portuguese government is doing everything
  to mould the greatest of modern black nations</p>

<p>   Commercially, I noticed that the great Dutch
   firm (<unclear/> AfriKassche Handels <unclear/>)
   in building three new homes in Kabinda with
   a view to transferring here the bulk of their</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60020.jpg"/>

<p>Banana business, and those escape to some extent the
   vexation taxation and regulation of the Kongo State</p>

<p>   As the Portuguese steamers no longer
   Banana and the Portuguese port at S. Antonio
   has no great importance, I saw little of the state
   of affairs on the Congo, and what I heard the
   Department may know from its agent out there (?).</p>

<p>Ambiz
    This place lives entirely from the coffee which
   the rations bring from the interior, and owes its
   importance and prosperity to the fact that its tariff
   is very moderate compared to that of Loanda.
   I heard that Mr. Newton has obtained a concession
   for a company to work again the old and rich
   copper-mines of Bemba, back of Ambiz</p>

<p>Loanda.
       Here I noticed immediately that a new
   life has come into the old city and that it
   will soon count among the great parbon of the
   world. The change that has taken place in the
   18 months of my absence is wonderful. Politically,
   the spirit of indpendence has <unclear/> from the
   natives to which and the question is colored
   in the minds of the leaving men. Be it sufficient
   to state that the first thing, on <unclear/>
   again, which the two first men of Loanda
   (the first lawuer & the director of the Bank) told</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60021.jpg"/>

<p>me in a whisper was : Things are in but shape
   in Portugal, are they not? The Republic and
   the indpendence of this are not for. Both these
   men have about 20 years residence in Loanda, &
   have made up their minds to finish their careers
   in these parts. One of them is already limited are
   is the future President.</p>

<p> Shortly before my arrival, all the leading traders
   of Loanda, at the call of native leader, had held
   a great indignation-masking and rearbred to protest
   against the cession of Loanda and the contracts
   allowing the Congo State to buy 500 natives
   of Angola. As I already wrote to the Depart-
   ment, they also effectionally hindered the
   purchase of any natives for Kongo State service,
   and the agent of the Kongo State, after being
   this reason from the shock & the abuse of mor-
   phine, had to return to the Kongo without having
   obtained anything. It must also be noticed
   that the people of Loanda solemnly declared,
   and stick to it, that they maintain their <unclear/>
   to the part of the Loanda country allowed to the
   Kongo State, and they <unclear/> to enforce it as
   soon as they see an opportunity.</p>

<p> Annexed to this are 1) The protests
   of the capital (Loanda) against the two
   contracts with the Congo State, in which</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60022.jpg"/>

<p>protect they declare that for them the Portuguese
   parliament does not reperesent the natives, but is 
   only a body of mercenaries 2) The letter of 
   thanks of the same meeting to Ex-Governor
   terrain do General for his speech against those
   contracts with the Kongo-State 3) The protest
   of the Commercial Association of Loanda, to which
   all the leading firms belong.</p>

<p>These three documents have been largely signed 
  by all the whites and natives who are not in the
  employ of the government.</p>

<p>I have not the time to translate them; but as
   the Department his a translator who knows Portu-
   guese I advise that those important documents
   the precursors of the declaration of independence
   be translated by him and duly noticed</p>

<p>Gringo Andongo
    I also enclose a no. of the Future & Angola
  continuing an important article As paiz &
  the protest of the municipality of Pengo An-
  dongo a large town some 300 miles in the inte-
  rior. It is remarkable that four of the 
  fire members of the municipal board are
  natives and the <unclear/> the Resident, delcares that
  his wife and children being born Angolans, his
  sympathies are with them. The protest of the
  municipality though crushed in the most rebellions</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60023.jpg"/>

<p>has <unclear/> was signed by most of the whites of
   Pengo Andongo. On sending the protest of the
   Loanda papers for publication the president of
   the municipality states that of the governor
   dissolve the municipality all in ready to <unclear/>
   it.</p>

<p>Dondo
   Not long ago,the exiled journalist Joao Chagas
   (of the Oports Rebellion) was invited to visit Dondo
   about 6000 population) & get from the Governor
   General the permission to go. On his arrival, the 
   municipality went in a body to receive him at
   the steamer; a grand reception was given him in
   the town, Republican speeches were made and 
   a street was given the name of Joao Chagas.
   The Governor treatment to dissolvethe muni-
   cipality, but on learning that it was sure to be
   re-elected, he contended himself with suspending
   the government "Chefe" for not suppressing that
   manifestation. As to Joao Chagas he was sent,
   for punishment to the delicious climate of Mos-
   sammedes where he continues his propaganda.</p>

<p>Mossamedes
    What happened or was going to happen here
   is still somewhat mysterious; but one thing is
   known namely that a sargeant & some of the
   new immigrants had made a plot to seize <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60024.jpg"/>

<p><unclear/> Governor and make a revolution.
   his companions and these were shipped to Portuguese
   Guinea.</p>

<p> The annual war with the natives in the interior
   of Mossamedes, on the Kunene River has in it appears,
   <unclear/> not a failure for the Portuguese, this year. After
   an initial success in which more than 6000 <unclear/>
   of cattle were <unclear/> from the natives, the Portu-
   guese (black) troops have had to withdraw and
   have moved in Mossamedes in great disorder.
   The Governor General has gone there by last steamer,
   in order to investigate the two questions.</p>

<p> Sr. Dantes Baracho, the delegate of the Portuguese
   government for the delimitation of the Loanda, who
   has been here more than two months doing nothing
   was also to go with the Governor but at last <unclear/>
   mail a telegram came and he returned ashore 
   with his baggage.</p>

<p> People here say that if the Delegate of the Congo
   State comes, they will not let the two delegates
   go to the interior.</p>

<p>The Spanish <unclear/> of war Isabel II
    Though <unclear/> importance, the following fact has its
   significance. The Isabel II has been here for <unclear/>
   time, and for a few days had the company of
   an English flagship and of a German <unclear/>
   After the departure of the latter, the fearing <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60025.jpg"/>

<p>of Loandagave a grand reception to the Spanish
   officers, and , ironically, alas invited the English
   The morning only , and no they did. As to the Spaniards
   and Portuguese, though they said it was no political
   manifestation, they could not help letting "it owe"
   as the return-ball offered a brand by the Span-
   iards, when one of the officers forgot himself &
   added to his <unclear/> for Portugal & Spain, the con
   trary for England. The "Isabel II"-sails to day
   for the Cape.</p>

<p>     Summing up, I wish to state that in
   Portugal the general feeling is, that the inde-
   pendence of Angola is a thing to rejoice in
   rather than anything else, provided the Portug-
   guese element remains permanent, and <unclear/>
   natives who speak & write Portuguese an not yet
   <unclear/>from the Portuguese government has a
   twofold object in view, in sending out thousand
   of immigrants to Angola: 1) to export the revolu-
   tionaries of the word type, and thus to present
   an immediate popular attackat home, 2)
   to introduce so many Portuguese into Angola,
   before, by indpendence, it opens with it doors
   to all nations, and thus seems the predominant
   of the Portuguese <unclear/> and tradition as</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60026.jpg"/>

<p>in Brazil. As in all other things, honor, the
   Portuguese government goes against its own interests,
   for it sends out men, and so few white women,
   there these immigrants are going to raise a lot
   of mulattoes who are more offered to Portuguese
   rule than the blacks.</p>

<p> A hundred thousand hectors of the best land
   on the high and healthy plateau of Caconda
   and Bike have been granted to a Portuguese
   Company who is to establish there a colony
   with the hundreds of importants <unclear/>
   government.</p>

<p> As to trade with the United States and
   opportunites for American capitalists to make
   grand stipulations this is one of the most
   promising fields. The people have fuel
   <unclear/> that for the builiding up of
   a great nation in this land no nation
   can be more helpful to them than our
   United States who are the model and
   ideal appear which they are striving.

<p>No. 14 CO=onsulate of the United States,
        at St. Paul de Loanda November 21, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
            Assistant Secretary of State,
                                        Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        In accordance with your instruction
   No. 3, of March 19, 1891, I have the honor
   to submit to your approval my nomination
   of Rev. Lancaster C. Burling, as vice 
   Commercial Agent, or as Vice-Consul, at 
   this port.</p>

<p>     The nominee is an American citizen,
   of age, an ordained minister of the M. 
   R. Church of America and has been two
   years at Loanda, as a missionary con-
   nected with Bishop N. Taylor's mission</p>

<p>     These facts will, I hope, be considered
   suffiient eveidence that the candidate
   is qualified for the office.</p>

<p>     As the Portuguese authorities are so much
   inclined to see political agents in all
   foreign missionaries, I would have pre-</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70006.jpg"/>

<p>ferred a layman; but, there being no other
   American available, I had no choice.</p>

<p> As for my reasons in not re-nominating
   Mr. Bannister, the principal one is the 
   violent hatred of the Portuguese for all 
   Englishmen and all that is English, which
   makes it uniwse to have an Englishman
   represent the United States. Then, according
   to Regulations, an American, whom equally 
   qualified, is to be preferred to an alien.</p>

<p>                 I am, Sir, 
                               your obedient servant
                                    Heli Chatelain
                               U.S. Coml Agent</p>

<p>P.S. The exequatur of my appoint-
   ment as Commercial Agent, and that
   of Mr. Bannister as Vice-Consul, have
   at length come and will be presented
   to the Governor General on his return from
   the South of the Province.

       Yesterday, at its regular monthly

   to inform you that the name 
   decided upon, or adopted, was

<p>No. 15
        Consulate of the United States,
      at St. Paul de Loanda, Nov. 21, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
             Assistant Secretary of State
                                        Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
       Whereas we now have a U.S. Board
   on Geographic Names, whose duty it is to sim-
   plify and rectify geographic nomenclature, both
   for official and public use, and
    Whereas the official name given in the U.S.
   to this city and Consulate, St. Paul de Loanda,
   is neither correct nor practical, and has 
   been the cause of many petty <unclear/> ances,</p>

<p>     I respectfully submit to the Department
   for the consideration of afore-said Board,
   and eventual action of Congress rectifying
   the official name of this Consulate, the
   following reasons for suggesting that 
   St. Paul de Loanda be rectified to Loanda.
   (1) The native name of this city was at
     the time of conquest, and has been to this
     day Luanda, in Portuguese spelling</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70010.jpg"/>

<p>Loanda, and pronounced by both natives and
   Portuguese: Lwàndà.</p>

<p>(2) Because the place was discovered by the
    Portuguese on St. Paul's day (1407), they
   as was their custom called it Lao Paulo de 
   Loanda that is St. Paul de Loanda.
        The form San Paolo de Loanda, after seen
   on charts and on letters, is half Spanish.</p>

<p>(3) And because the place was reconquered
    from the Dutch on the day of the Virgin's
    Assumption (1648) the name of Loanda
    was enlarged to Sao Paulo de Assum-
   cao de Loanda</p>

<p>(4) These cumbersome and highsounding
   names were, however, never used by the 
   residents of Loanda, whether native or for-
   eign; they stuck to the plain Loanda.</p>

<p>(5) The English,-ever poor linguists,-in
   dealing with this name, made two blun-
   ders: 1. On their charts, in their book, and
   every where, they preferred to the popular
   and plain, the long widned official, name
          2. Owing probably to a confusion of 
   Loanda with Loango, north of the Kongo River,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70011.jpg"/>

<p>they wrote and pronounced, instead of
   Loanda, Loando.</p>

<p>(6) Now as in conversation at least,
      Englishman and Americans do not care 
      for long names, many have taken 
      the habit to shorten the name not
      by dropping the merely historical St.
      Paul and assumption, but by learning
      our Loanda, and they call the city
      St. Paul's. I fthe word is used
      with English speaking people, the question
      is which St. Paul's is meant, and
      if used with any Portguese or other
      foreigner no one recognizes Loanda
      in that name. Hence misunderstandings,
      losses of letters, and other little troubles.
    (7) The Portuguese and Colonial govern-
      ments; all the Portuguese and Angolan 
      people; the English, German & French
      steamers run to Loanda; the German,
      English and other European map
      makers; in a word, allthose who
      have to do with, or know something
      about Loanda,-have for several</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70012.jpg"/>

<p>,years past, used this name exclusively
   and the old <unclear/> St. Paul de
   Loando, yes even the correct St. Paul
   de Loanda, must be considered practi-
   cally dead, or moribound.</p>

<p> (8) Therefore the U.S. Board on Geo-
       graphic Names, and the U.S. Congress,
       (as for to te title of this Consulate is
       concerned would confer a favor on
       all concerned-Post-Offices, Schools,
       Mariners, travelers, traders, geographers,
       and on the U.S.'S representation as
       this port-if they would give the 
       venerable old term an official home,
       and give their official sanction to the
       use of the genuine and modern,
       though immemorial, name
            Loada.</p>

 <p>No. 17 Consulate of the United States,
          St. Paul de Loanda, Dec. 31, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable Wiliam F. Wharton
             Assistant Secretary of State,
                                          Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
       Desiring to inform the Department of various
    occurences, each of which is not important enough
    for a special Report,  but may be of some use, es-
    pecially to the editor of the Consular Reports, I
    collect them all in one of miscellaneous
    nears.</p>

<<p>I. Rains, sickness,Plenty Lack of the 
   demand for unfree labor. After two years of drought,
   the first rains (Sept. to Jan.) have been very copious
   and this fact is attended by the three following conce-
   quences: (1) With the unusual dampen of the season, from 
   fevers and other tropical diseases have increased to an 
   alarming extent. Nobody escapes the effets of the <unclear/>;
   one by one, all are laid on the sick-bed, some
   to rise no more, the great majority to ail on for
   some time and then resume their normal state
   and usual occupations. I been suffering</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70015.jpg"/>

<p>these two months from a kind of rheumatism and
   hand have had two review attacks of fever.</p>

<p>(2) With the drought, the dearth to coming an 
   end, and 1892 promises to be a your of plenity.
   How great the dearth was, may be inferred from
   the fact that large quantities of Brazilian manioc-
   meal ("farinha de pas") imported into this land
   of manioc and sold for about half of the price of the
   best native article, while foreign American corn,
   rice and beans successfully competed with these
   of the country. One good result of the dearth is that
   the natives have learnt to eat bread, and having 
   once acqired the habit, are not likely to give it
   up with the return of cheap native produce. This en-
   larged consumption of bread means an important in-
   crease in the importation of American flour.</p>

<p>(3)As soon as the showers soften the soil, the natives 
   leave the exacting service of the whites and take
   the cultivation of their own fields. This causes
   a lack of carriers for the rubber and wax of the
   far interior as well as for the coffee of the Cazongo
   plantation and a general insufficiency of free
   hired laborers for the railroad and all other
   work depending on them. This shortening neces-
   sarily entails an increased demand for unfree,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70016.jpg"/>

<p>or contract, labor. Within a short time, the prices of 
   "servicaes" at Novo Redondo/Novo Redondo) and Benguella,
   which are now the principal markets, have risen from 
   40 to 70 <unclear/> (one <unclear/>=#1.09) per head, and the
   prices may rise to double that amount before long.
   The dealers say that the Congo State recruiting agent
   offers them 750 <uncear/> per man, and make this a 
   plea for <unclear/> up the prices of of course the greater
   the profits realized in the business the greater also the
   activity developed in procuring the merchandise, that
   is in "redeeming" slaves from the interior which is 
   simply a revised edition, of the old slave-traffic.</p>

<p>II Political News. The Congo State officer, Mons.
   Braconnier, who has taken the place of the unfortu-
   nate Vanderelde as recruiting agent of 500 Angola
   men for the Congo State army is still here at a ho-
   tel waiting for the Portuguese residents to relax their 
   opposition to this exportation of unfree labor. The
   resistance of the colonists to the home government
   in this atter has met with the approval of the whole
   colonial and liberal press in Portugal. Some papers even 
   go so far as to advise Angola to demand self govern-
   ment and prepare its independence. The prospect of 
   bankruptcy in Portugal inclines the Portuguese resid-
   ents in favor of the native ideal of independence.
   Rather separation than shame is the mottoof every
   Meanwhile here as in Portugal, men of action are</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70017.jpg"/>

<p>not to be found.</p>

<p>Aided by friends and officials, the three principal
   rebels of the late insurrection at Oports, have manged
   to escape from their exile. One went to Gabon; the 
   whereabouts of the two others is known only to the friend
   who saw them off.</p>

<p>Senhor Dantos Baracho, the Portuguese Commissioners
   for defining the Eastern boundary of Angola with the
   Congo State has been here, since August doing nothing but earn
   his salary, the total of which is said to amount to
   twelve Pounds (60 dollars) per day. Nor is there only
   sign or probability of his going to his destination
   before next May or June. As his salary is charged 
   to the Provincial Treasury the dissatisfaction of the
   colonists may be imagined.</p>

<p>Every Portuguese packet continues to bring from
   50-60 emigrants sent to the West-Coast by the
   Portuguese government in order to deplete the
   poisons and get rid of dangerous and starving
   tramp. While rational colonization would be 
   a blessing to the Province and the home-country,
   this kind of assisted emigration is a curse and
   a source of endless troubles.</p>

<p>III New Line of Steamers. Nothing proves better
   the immense resources and growing prosperity
   of the Province then the rapid and steady de-
   velopment of steam navigation. While our</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70018.jpg"/>

<p>Philadelphia Board of Trade and enterprising men
   of Baltimore and New York have talked for years
   about a steam ship line to connect America with
   Africa, and have not yet reached the print of sending
   a trial steamer, the humble Jewish firm of Ben-
   chiniol Lobinho (Lisbon & Loanda) has within
   five months bought, repaired and run between Angola,
   S. Thomé, Lisbon and Liverpool, four old height
   steamers, a far trips of which will suffice to pay 
   their cost. Without lowering the freight-charged
   by the other company without Government aid, the enterprise 
   has proved a grand success.</p>

<p>There is some talk of a third Portuguese Company
   running steamers between the same ports.
   IV-Vita case. About a year ago, a pupil of
   the Baptist Mission at Sau Salvador (in the Congo
   District of this Province) called Vita, accidentally
   shot  one his comrades. He was examined by the
   Portuguese Resident (who knows neither English nor
   the Kongo language) and sent, a prisoner, to 
   Loanda, there to be judged by the competent au-
   thority. As, after months of waiting, the mission-
   aries heard nothing about the lad, two of them 
   came at different times to Loanda to find out
   his whereabouts and to have him bought to trial
   Mr. Ed. Bannister (then acting British Consul)
   did what he could for them, but in vain</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70019.jpg"/>

<p>Hearing of my arrival, the missionaries thought my
   popularity might be more successful, and wrote to 
   ask my intervention on the lad to behalf. I answered,
   that, as the lad was a Portuguese subject I could
   do nothing officially, but would use my private <unclear/>
   in favor of their protégé. Not only was I immediately 
   told where the prisoner was, and allowed to see him,
   but the "Delegado" who was to judge the case, and
   to whom I explained the pariculars, released the
   poor fellow witht he statement that the papers 
   concerning the case had disappeared. The young
   man had been kept eight months in jail without
   trial and (forgotten as his case was) might have
   rotted away there, had not his missionary protection 
   preserved to thed end.</p>

<p>V. Stars and stripes in Congo State. On Dec. 8
   Rev: J. Chester Hyde, of the American Baptist <uncleaer/>
   wrote to me as the nearest consul, since the death
   of Lieut Taunt, desiring some information on the
   right of flying the Star and Stripes in the Congo 
   State. . 2nd Nov.(1891) "says her" Governor General
   Walms; returning from the interior, visited me,
   I flew the stars and stripes in his honor. The
   next day the commissary of our district in-
   formed me that only consuls were allowed
   to display their national colors beyond the
   limits of Matado and I was requested to com</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70020.jpg"/>

<p>ply with the laws. Perhaps you may have some instruc-
   tions concerning the stars and stripes. I answered
   that (1) the Congo State is outside my consular sphere,
   (2) but I would communicate the matter to you, and (3) 
   in my private opinion the display of flags is a matter
   of country, not of right, but that if,in <unclear/>
   circumstances, other nationalities were allowed to
   display their colors, an American might expect the 
   same privilege.</p>

<p>Complainst against over regulation and taxation,
   and in room red-tape in the Congo State as general
   <unclear/> traders and missionaries of all nationalities.
   VI I have just seen,o n his way home, Mr. Faulkner,
   a Canadian missionary, who spent a few years in Ka-
   tanga, or Garenganza, as it is known through Fred.
   A. Arnot's book. He told me how Mudiri, the 
   King of Garnganza, was alarmed when he saw Mr.
   Sharpe, the agent of the British South Africa Company
   approach his capital from the East, "by the back-door"
   as he styled it, and how he absolutely rejected 
   proposed British Protectorate and bade Mr. Sharpe
   leave his countr at once, as soon as he heard that the
   British wanted his copper mines. As is well known,
   the Congo State has already conceded all those mines
   and the whole of Mushiri's Kingdom to the Belgian
   Katanga Company, though no Belgian had ever are
   there a foot or get permission from Mushiri to exploit</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70021.jpg"/>

<p>his land and mines. Quite recently the Belgian
   expedition of said Company and the Congo State
   have been at Mushiri's capital and may have 
   been more fortunate than Mr. Sharpe.

  Department.</p>
   
<p>   For my first oath to form no. 101, I 
  was governed by the practice of the Consulate.
  Closer study and reflection made me doubt
  its legality and I went for the second with,</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_70025.jpg"/>
   
<p>to notary public, "tabillias". He refused
   to administer teh oath, stating that he was not
   authorized to do so by law. In order to settle 
   this point and find out whether any other 
   functionary could perform that office, I called
   on a judge who knows English and is the 
   highest authority in the Province on question of
   laws, and I laid the question before him.</p>
   
<p>   His answer was that the Portuguese law
  recognizes only two kinds of oaths: (1) the 
  oath of office of public funtionaries, administrated 
  by ajudge (2) the judicial oath, administered
  by the judge in court. Any other oath is not
  legal, and any functionary administering it 
  makes himself liable to prosecution. The signed
  declaration of a party is as binding as an oath could
  be and the only thing a notary public can do
  is to legalize the signature, thus prosecuting doubts
  as to the genuineness of the signature.</p>
   
<p>   Trusting the Department will either sanc-
  tion the course hitherto pursued at this Consulate
  or clearly state how that oath is to be taken 
  in the future, I have the honor to be, Sir
                     Your obedient servant

<p>Sir:
      Since New-Year the political condition
   has remained unchanged.</p>

<p>   Every by-weekly steamer continues to
  bring some 20-50 <unclear/> and criminals
  sent by the Portuguese government to colonize
  West Africa. Many tis, a few manage
  to go home at the expense of charitable people
  or captains, the rest setlles down to work, and
  tries to make a living.</p>
   
<p>   The telegraphic news, about middle of
  January, of the change of government in Portugal
  has quisted the spirits and given 
  new hopes tto the decomcratic patriots
  The present minister of Colonies, his secretary
  and the secretary of the Minister of Foreign
  affairs are almost Loanda-people, having
  been here so long and two of the being married</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_80001.jpg"/>
   
<p>to white natives of this city.</p>
   
<p>   In order to get over her financial crisis,
   Portugal must find money somewhere, and 
   the pawning or the selling of some of her Col-
   onies is inevitable. I know from personal
   friends in ruling circles from the conversation
   of the people, and pigment hints of the frees
  of all colors, France or Germany woulde be strongly
  objected to by the people., the pawning or sale of
  Macao, or the Agries, or the Cape-Verde
  Islands or Kabinda (near mouth of Congo),
  all strategic points of unsupposable im-
  portance for our navy and our commerce
  of the future, to the United States, would 
  be viewed with favor, you hailed with joy,
  by the majority of the people.</p>
   
<p>   I can't help drawing again the attention
  of the Deaprtment even at the risk of ap-
  pearing impertinent, to this unique chance
  of securing one, a few, or all of those
  splendid ports.</p>

   Official relations between this Consulate
          and the Province of S. Thome</p>
   
   
<p>Abstract of Contents.
   (1) Though comprised within this Consular
      district, the Province of S. Thome has never
      had any official relation withthis Consulate.
   (2) It seems desirable that, when appointed
      the U.S. Consul at Loanda be also introd-
      ced, by the Portuguese government to the
      Governor of S. Thome.
   (3) For complete statistics and better 
      reports the Consulate ought to receive
      the Official Bulleting of S. Thome, as
      it already recieves that of Angola.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
             Assistant Secretary of State,
                                          Washington, D.C.</p>
   
<p>Sir:
       The Islands of S. Thome (St. Thomas)
   and Principe (Prince's Isld.), comprised
   within my consular district, form a separate
   Province, with a Governor of its own, and with
   an Official Bulleting, in which all official
   communications and statistics of S. Thome
   are publicshed.</p>
   
<p>   As far as I know, the U.S. Consul at
   Loanda, when appointed and approved, is   
   introduced by the Portuguese government
   to the Governor of Angola alone, and not to
   that of S. Thome, nor has the Official 
   Bulletin of S. Thome inc been sent to
   this Consulate.</p>
   
<p>   As the Islands of S. Thome and Principe
   are by their large plantations of coffee,
   cocoa and other tropical produce constantly</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_80004.jpg"/>
   
<p>growing in commercial importance and promise
  to have  considerable trade relations with the
  United States as soon as the means of
  communications improve and the production
  of either country be made known, it seems
  desirable that the incumbent of this Consular
  post be officially introduced, by the Portuguese
  government, to the Governor of S. Thome, and
  that the Official Bulletin of S. Thome be
  sent to this Consulate as that of Angola al-
  ready is.</p>
   
<p>   I therefore sggest to the Deartment
  the advisability of requesting those two
  favors of the Protugese government.
         I am, Sir,
                     Your obedient servant

<p>F.O. St. Clair, Esquire 
        Chief of Conslar Bureau
                  Washington,</p>
   
<p>Dear Sir:
            On the receipt of your letter
   dated February 16, 1892, I at once wrote to
   the missionary in charge at Gabon requesting
   him to give me the information you desire
   concerning the U.S property at that post.</p>
   
<p>         Pending his anser, I hasten to give 
   you what I already know on the subject.</p>
   
<p>         Mr. Graham C. Campbell; whom
   you mention as having the last, on June 30, 1886,
   drawn for salary as U.S. Commercial Agent
   at Gabon, has been since then in the
   States and is not expected to return to Africa.</p>
   
<p>         Mr. Joseph H. Reading, who sent,</p>
   
<pb facs="ViewScan_800008.jpg"/>

<p>in February 1887, the last communiation you
   received from Gabon, has also been in the
   States, for some four years past, and will probably
   stay there. He published in 1890 as Philadelphia
   a description of the West-Coast entitled "The
   Ogowe Ban" and was then residing in a 
   small town of New Jersey.</p>

<p>     Through a Gabon missionary who <unclear/>
   on me here about two months ago, I know that
   at that time the U.S. coat of arms was still
   hung out at the American Presbyterian Mission
   house of Baraka near Libreville, the capital 
   of the "French Congo"; for this is now the <unclear/>
   native of the former Colony of Gabon.</p>

<p>     Probably all the Consular archives are
   there intact as left by Mr. Reading, the
   mission station having been <unclear/>
   occupied since his departure.</p>

<p>     It is well <unclear/> decided that, owing 
   to the prohibition to teach in any but the <unclear/>
   language, all the American Presbyterian
   Mission Station in French territory that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800009.jpg"/>

<p>be passed over to the Paris Evangelical Mission-
   ary Society who has a young work in that region.</p>

<p>     The efforts of the American Presbyterian
   Mission (North) will then be chiefly directed
   to the southern and inland portion of the German
   Protectorate of Kameroun, where there is greater 
   liberty. The flourishing station of Corisco and
   Benita will no doubt be kept up as long as 
   Spain allows them to develop peacefully.</p>

<p>     As to the expediency of continuing or
   discontinuing that consular post, allow me to
   suggest that unless they be disinterested
  philanthropist, consular officers from America
  at $1000.00 in a deadly climate like that
   of Tropical Africa, will not in fact can not-
   be of a quality to honour their country or 
   to give satisfaction to the Department of State.
   They will never stay long enough in their dis-
   tricts to form an intelligent opinion of their
   state and resources, or obtain reliable in-
   formation of any sort.</p>

   artment of State <unclear/>. Consuls who are or
   promise to become, authorities on African questions</p>

<p>where and is of greater weight then the accounts
   published in daily papers, who ar determined to
   make a serious study of their districts, and who
   are able to condense the results of their investigations
   into readable reports. Such Americans cannot be ex-
   pected to spend or sacrifice their lives in tropical 
   Africa for $1000.00per annum.</p>

<p>     Any one acquainted with modern Africa, who
   peruse our Consular reports on this great Continent
   South of the Sahara and north of the Cape, must be
   struck witht he sad inefficiency of our Consular
   in that region, and must realize the need of a 
   complete reorganization of that service of it is
   do practice to the United State not only morally, com-
   mercially and industrially, but on the highest <unclear/>
   politically.</p>

<p>     Unless our government's adhesion to the
   Brussel's Act is to be an empty form, it behoves
   the United State to be kept posted by its own agents
   on the real state of slavery and slave-trade in
   Africa and this cannot be without our Consular
   system in said region entailing a new phase.</p>

<p>     I am preparing a <unclear/> of reports of
   Angola.

<p>Sir:
        Having often had occasion to notice 
   how little the Province of Angola is
   known in Europe, and still less in America,
   and realizing what benefits may result
   to this Province and to commerce in general
   if it be presented to the public in a

   fill the gap by giving in few words a
   general idea of my consular district.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to transmit to the
   Department enclosed, a Report on the
   subject. It is not the reproduction of
   anything of the kind previously published
   in any language, but the result of 
   eight years' hard study on the ground.</p>

<p>     As soon as possible, I intend to draw
   a map of the Province, also entirely</p>

<p>Honroable Wm. F. Wharton
                Assistant Secretary of State,
                                            Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir: 
        Since my dispatch no. 20, dated February
   13, 1892, no material changes have taken place
   in the political and commercial situation of this 
   Province. Still some events may be of interest
   to the Department.</p>

<p>     Evaision of the Oports Rebels: Most of the
   common soldiers who took part int he Oports Rebellion
   of January 31, 1891, and who had been exiled to  
   this Province and that of S. Thomé have been 
   pardoned in the early part of this year and have
   returned to Portugal. Of the chiefs of the rebellion
   only one is till here, and for the simple reason
   that he has no desire at all to Loanda.
   All the other leaders of the Rebellion have contrived
   to escape to France. One embarked at Mossamedes
   on a sailing vessel bound for Gabon and reached 
   his destination without difficulty. The Director of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800016.jpg"/>

<p>the Amstrm-House at Mossamedes was censured and
   the "Official Bulletin" for conniving with the evasion,
   but was not otherwise punished. Two other leading
   rebels were at Loanda, put in boxes and embarked on frail
   steamer boun for the Norht. At Ambrig, However,
   sea-sickness caused by the usual <unclear/> of
   that coast compelled one of the secret passengers
   to open the wicket of his box, and led to the discovery,
   of the two fugitives. The captain of the steamer had 
   them bound with chains and delivered them to the
   Portuguese authorities of Ambrig, they were accopmanied
   to the ofrt by a detachment of soldiers and by a chasing
   crowd who hailed in them the matrys of the Republic
   after a few days of banqueting with their Republican
   friends of Ambrig and recieving 300 dollars embarked
   in a far houses by all the leading tradrs, the rebels 
   again escaped on a sailing-vessel bound for Gabon,
   where they met their comrade from Mossamedes
   and whence all embarked for France. After 
   leadng men of Ambrig were arrested and brought
   to Loanda in a man of war; but is the whole po-
   pulation of Ambrig had openly taken <unlcear/> in the e-
   vaision, and the population of Loanda too was favoring
   it, the men were agian sent home unmolested.
   A fourth leader of the Rebellion escaped in the same</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800017.jpg"/>

<p>manner-with the secret assistance of Republican gov-
   ernment officials from Principe (Prince's Island) and the accomplices were more seemingly
   presented.</p>

<p>Public feeling. The public opinion of Angola which for
   a time leaned strongly towards separation from the metaphors;
   ceased agitating this question, when the Dias Ferreira ministry
   took the helm of government, because many hoped it would
   by a coup d'etat "establish" the Republic. Then the tariff
   question called public attention to another side, and now 
   the presiding feeling is one of discouragement. "Everything
   is lost; Portugal is dead" is now a frequent expression.</p>

<p>Commercial situation and the new tariff. The main provisions
   of the new tariff are: (1) MOst duties are charged according to the
   weight of the merchandise (2) Portuguese goods are free or
   well-nigh so (3) All foreign imports pay much higher duties,
   (4) The duty in foreign alcohol is prohibition, (5) The Governor
   has no longer the ferver to exempt any goods from paying
   duties, (6) The Kongo District, which enjoyed free-trade
   is now, by an agreement between Portugal and the Kongo
   State, subjected to a tariff more moderate than that
   of the Kongo State. This new tariff does not interfere
   much with American imports: machines continue to be free,
   kerosene and flour are necessities and Portugal can not
   compete in them, and timber pays little more than <unclear/>
   as to the general effect of the new tariff, everybody is now
   argues that it was mistake, that its only result will
   be a rise in the prices of all necessities, and hence
   of labor, and the final desertion of these markets by</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800018.jpg"/>

<p>the native trade of this far interior (rubber-trade)
   which will prefer the Kongo-route. Of all events,
   Angola which had enjoyed unusual prosperity during
   the terrible crisis of Portugal is beginning to loss confi-
   dence since the new tariff has come, credit is being
   withheld and the air is full of fear for the future</p>

<p>Railroad extension. On the 17th of may fulfil the section of the Loanda
   railroad was opened to the public. The daily up and 
   down trains run now over 220 kilometres. The territories,
   Cassoalalae, is on the Lucalla river, near Dondo. The
   coffee district of Cazengo, which is the main object of
   the railroad, is not yet reached, but every new section
   of 20 kilometres will already left the planters to bring
   their coffee to the territories of river navigation. The <unclear/>
   rates are still to high to compete with the river boats
   or to induce the native trader of the interior to make 
   of the railroad. Most of the Angolan natives, to, prefer to walk
   over the track rather than pay the fare. The railroad
   as far as opened, is still far from paying, but the govern-
   ment guarantees the interest on all the capital <unclear/>
   spent by the company on the road. This is the reason
   why the company does not care to increase either the
   passengers or the freight traffic; which could easily be 
   done by a general reduction. Poorly built and <unclear/>
   as this railroad is, it is a decided blessing to the countries
   and is sure to pay a good dividend when the coffee
   region is fully tapped, that is in three to six years</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800019.jpg"/>

<p>The new trek of Boers. When, last year, the Boers of
   Humpeta, in the district of Mossamedes, helped the
   Portuguese government to subdue Bihe, they were so
   pleased with that cool and <unclear/> high plateau
   that they wrote to the Transvaal inviting their contingence,
   to come and join them. Now this near trek of BOers, estimated 
   at about 200 <unclear/> is daily expected in the south.
   The Portuguese government has sent there the officer who
   knows best how to deal with he Boers, having maried
   one of their daughters, and the people and government
   hope he will be able to settle the new orners without
   conflict. Hitherto the colony of Boers has been a State
   within the State, jealously maintaining their own religion,
   customs, administration, language race. They elect their
   own commandants, carefully and intermarriage with the Portu-
   guese, and only go to war for hte Portuguese government
   when the latter agrees to pay them what they ask. Nor,
   have they ever paid taxes. If, on the arrival of the new
   trek, the Boers should decide to found a new Republic,
   there is no military power in Angola that could prevent it;
   and if the Portuguese government should try to subject the
   Boers to the common administration, there is no doubt but
   that it would hasten the formation of a Boer-State.</p>

<p>It does not talk a prophet to foresee the loss of Portugal
   of the highlands of Bihe, Gangda and Ambriola, and
   the formation in the near future of a State which European
   statesmen never dreamt of, when they partitioned Africa</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800020.jpg"/>

<p>King Mushidi of Katanga shot According to a letter
   from Captain Stairs to a missionary in Bihe, King 
   Mushidi of Katanga (Garngaza) was shot by an
   officer of Stairs, as he was ordering his soldiers to
   fire on the approaching column of Stairs' expedition
   I already informed the Departmet of how Mushidi he
   coolly rejected the British Protectorate offered him by Mr.
   Sharpe of the South Africa Company. It appears he was
   going to do the same with the expedition of the Kongo
   State; bu the latter felt strong enough to fight, and
   so made short work with the King's resistance. <unclear/>
   to Stairs' expedition, the King had kindly "recieved the
   Kongo-State expedition under Lieut. Le Marinal, whom
   I had the pleasure of meeting in Loanda on his
   way to Europe. Though Le Marinal, missionaries on 
   the spot, and nation just come from there, I learn that

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
               Assistant Secretary of State,
                                            Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have to acknowledge the receipt
   of your instructions No. 12, dated
   March 5, 1892, no. 13, dated April
   6, 1892, and of your circulars dated
   January 21, 30, February 2, 10, 15, 24,
   26, and March 6, 9,7, 19,16, which have had
   due attention.</p>

<p>     I also have to thank the Depart-
   ment for sending out new seals and 
   furniture for the circular office, which
   have reached me in due course
   of time. Unfortunately the panes
   of the book-case were broken, one because
   the weight of the glass had loosened
   the wooden list holding inside and which
   was not sufficiently <unclear/>, the other
   because a board which had been nailed</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800022.jpg"/>

<p>inside got loose.</p>

<p>     Hitherto the Governor General used
   kindly to exempt COnsular effects from
   paying duty, but with the new tariff
   he is no longer allowed to that, as
   all the imports of the government are
   now subjected to the common tariff.
    Therefore teh two last shipments above
   mentioned had to be pay 20% ad
   valorem, which however was not put 
   too high.</p>

<p>     I have the honor, Sir, to be
                    your obedient servant

<p>Washington, D.C., A pril 15, 1892</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
            At the request of several gentleman in the Consular service
   we have recently examine with care the "Revised Tariff of Official
   Fees" as prescrived by Section 598 of the Regulations of 1888, and
   have reached the conclusion that several of the items therein speci-
   fied are erroneously and illegally classed as "official fees." If we
   are correct in our view of the law these fees are personal emoluments
   of the Consul and need not be accounted for to the Government. Our
   attention was first especially directed to the fee for administering
   the oath to emigrants for the free admission of their animals,
   vehicles, and personal effects (Form 93), under the Act of 1883,
   (Par. 677), but in the examination of the question we found it neces-
   sary to conisder the whole subject of official and unofficial fees,
   and we soon became convinced that under the Regulations many fees 
   were accounted for which in reality belonged to the officer.</p>

<p>         We are preparing, in connection with the fir of which ex-Sen-
   ator Omar D. Conger, of Michigan, is a member, to bring a series of
   suits in the United States Courts to test these various questions, 
   and would be glad to act for you. If you will authorize us so to do,
   by signing the annexed letter of authority, which need not be 
   acknowledged, we will examine your accounts in the Department and
   advise you as to what particular fees we think we can recover for you.</p>

<p>         We will not, in any event, use your case as a test one, and un-
   less the Courts sustain our position, we will not even file your 
   claim but will return the power of attorney to you.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800024.jpg"/>

<p>         We will undertake these cases upon a purely contingent fee and
   will not call upon you for any contribution, even towards expenses.
   In view of this we think a fee of 33 1/3 per cent. of the amount recov-
   ered would be reasonable.</p>

<p>         It will give us pleasure, if you desire it, to furnish you with
   special references as to our professional standing, etc., but refer
   generally to the Columbia National Bank and the Washington Loan and
   Trust Company.</p>

<p>                 Very respectfully,
                                        Jones & Voorhees.</p>

<p>P.S.--If the enclosed proposition is acceptable to you, please
   your reply give us the dates of your consular service, continuous
   or otherwise. We wold also esteem it a favor if you would give us
   thename of your predecessor and his address, if known to you.</p>

<p>There is an edict soon to be issued restraining all other

  French & English flags are not allowed nor inland
  of atadi and at stations on The Upper Kongo, except
  when the State flag is given preference at the top.</p>

<p>The French authorities interdict the use of the
   state flag on steamers starting from the French side
   Even canons without State flags cannot pass Equator

   to thus pas Bangalla.</p>

<p>As for the Belgian flag, it accompanies the
   state flag on the Upper Kongo steamers, but is not
   allowed on Buildings of the Railroad above Matadi.</p>

<p>I may gie you some of my observations during

   The State receives only money for staps and prefers
   money for taxes; and we must pay Coast labor partly

<p> I am sorry to say that the State took off the

<p>Sir:
        For the reasons enumerated below
      I take the liberty to request the De-
      partment to grant me a furlough to
      the United States, for the maximum
      time allowable and to begin as soon 
      as suitable to me in the early part
      of 1893.</p>

<p>     (1) Angola offers at the present time
      one of the most promising fields for
      American enterprise. Simple Consular
      reports are not sufficient to induce American
      capitalists to invest money in a country
      so far and unkown. It requires personal 
      conversation and to organize commercial
      undertaking. The first condition of im-
      portant commercial realtion between</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800032.jpg"/>

<p>America and Africa is the presence in
   Africa of reliable American firms. When 
   once set a-nothing the bal will soon be-
   beome an avalanche. Mr. Hart, of the Geo.
   Squir Mfetg.Co. Buffalo, N.Y., has
   been here a few weeks, and has already form
   The Loanda District alone, orders for more
   than $20.000 of agricultural machinery and
   the promise much more in the near
   future. On similar and other lives, American
   firms and individuals could do as well and
   better, of will represented on the shot.
   Tow German commercial travelers who can-
   vassed Angola a year ago got orders for
   about $200.000 and since then German
   imports are seriously competing with the
   English.</p>

<p>(2) The Consular reports from this field
    shall not suffer bymy furlough, as
    by correspondence with my friends here and
    by the papers of the Province, I shall be
    as well informed in America, and able
    to supplement any information in greater
    detail.</p>

<p>(3) The Chicago Congress on African ethnology</p>

<p>in connection with the Expedition_the publication
   of mylarge work on Angolan ethnology, especially
   on folk-lore, which is the most important contri-
   bution to that branch of science ever yet written,
   and which is sure to give haste to the above-
   mentioned Congress_and various other scientific
   meetings, associations and publications will be 
   greatly benefits by my presenece, even for a
   short time, in America.</p>

<p>(4) Last, but not leat, my physical consti-
   tution will, by that time need the bracing
   influence of a more temperate climate, and
   my heart and mind some relief from constant
   & close contact with <unclear/> and corruption of

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
              Assistant Secretary of State,
                                Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        Six weeks ago a partner of Newton,
    Carnegie & Co. showed me in clipping from 
    an English paper a Washington telegram
    <unclear/> that Congress had for the current
    fiscal year reduced the income of this
    Consulate, as that of other minor ones in
    Africa, to the fees.</p>

<p>     At the same time I was advised 
   not to be such a fool as to stayin Loanda
   spending money for a government that ceased 
   to support me.</p>

<p>     There being a probability of retrenchment
   in the budget of this Congress, I some-
   what expected that my salary would be
   stopped after the June quarter, and realizing
   the impossibility of my continuin long to
   Consul without any support; was awaiting</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90002.jpg"/>

<p>the official announcement of the reduction, in
   order to tender my resignation, and shut up
   this Consular officer-for without renmuneration
   as English-speaking person would take is. 
   As however, the official advice of the con-
   tailment has not yet come, nor do American
   papers confirm that news, I have begun to
   doubt its correctness.</p>

<p>     Still, as this question has set me a-then
   King, I have come to the conclusion that,
   whether the salary be continued or not, its 
   would only be just; in presence of familiar 
   cirucmstances of this port, of the Department
   would assume the expense of office-rent,
   not to exceed 7 dollars per month. This 
   is the request I now respectfully submit
   to yur decision.</p>

<p>     Considering further the fact, that I a
   not engaged in business and give all my 
   time to the collection and distribution of non-
   paying, yet highly useful, information n
   this vast Consular district, an appropriate
   increase of salary, whcih would per se settle
   the office question, would appear yet more
   just, and ensure the better standing of this
   past.

    Independence of Angola.
    The newspaper of the important
    colony are again concerned about
    the state of the Province and
    the negligence with which it is
    treated by the government of the
    metropolis. One of them, thus
    finishes are editorial on this
    subject.</p>

<p> Set therefore, the unanimous
   and <unclear/> cry of all be
    "the independence of Angola"
   In another article, the following may be read
   "This cannot, nor shall it, continue. The
   government is secretly selling the colonies
   and we do not want to be Englsih. Therefore,
   the only alternative left us is to proclaim
   the independence (autonomy) of the Province,
   imploring the protection of the United States
   of North-America. This, as is well known</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90007.jpg"/>

<p>would not be difficult; it will be done
   the day we want it.      It is, however,
   to be lamented, that good and loyal Portuguese,
   who long for the greatness of their counry, and
   love their native land, be forced by their 
   ill-omened government to co-operate in
   the disintegration of the father land."</p>

<p>     In another article, mentioning an
   injustice committed in S. Thomé, one
   roads:   "It becomes necessary for us
   to change our minds, far from the present
   regimen we can expect nothing but injustice
   and contempt."</p>

<p>     Thus it is that the government by
   its favorition and that of its delgates
   is estranging the sympathies of the colonies
   and pushing them to revolt.
        When the thing is done, it will be too late
   to repent.</p>

<p> The idea of autonomy has acquired,
    in these last times, a great prominence

   Portugal would reap the enormous

<p>already admitted the advisibility of self-

   symptoms is the cry of indpendence which
   is being heard in almost all the colonies.
   The Azores, Madeira, S. Thomé and An-
   gola already openly raise the banner of
   revolt and of annexation to the United States
   of America; and in East-Africa, where the
   Portuguese element is "scanty"; there is no
   dislike of becoming part of the proposed
   Federation of South-African States." And
   the disaffection towards Portugal goes
   on to show that it is justified.</p>

<p>  I may add that again and again whites and

   Salary for 1892-1893</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents
    By suppressing my salary two months before 
   I am acquainted with said suppression: by not providing
   for my support during the internal, nor for my transit
   home, nor for my release from my post, the
   government forces upon me a loss of from $800
   to $1000; while I have fulfilled my part of our contract.
    The appropriation for Mozambique in cntinued by COngress
    I will not desert my post, but await a cablegram
    from the Department, instructing me another to stay,
    or to go home, or to lose up,or appointing me to
    Mozambique under certain conditions. Something should
    be done to grand American interests in this Consular
    district, and to prevent a crying injustice.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
             Assistant Secretary of State,
                                          Washington, D.C.  </p>

<p>Sir:
       In accordance with your telegra-
   phic order "Close Consulate" of
   I have closed the U.S. Commercial
   Agency at Loanda and returned
   to the United States.</p>

<p>     The Governor General of Angola,
   officially informed by me, announced
   the closing of the Agency in the Official
   Bulletin, previous to my sailing.</p>

<p>     The furniture and archives of the
   Agency I left in charge of Mr. L.
   C. Burling of the American Methodist
   Episcopal  Mission at Loanda. This
   mission is willing to buy the furniture
   at a cheap rate, or to keep it in trust
   until the consulate be re-opened.
   The archives I have packed in various</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90014.jpg"/>

<p>boxes, ready for shipment, if the Department
   should want them removed: The bound
   books (Statutes, Commercial Relations, Consular
   Reports etc) fill one large case. The Records 
   are packed in a separate box; and so are
   the unused Fromes and the Manuscripts
   (Instructions, Circular and coresspondence)-
   with the seals.</p>

<p> As the archives do not contain any
   document of real value, and as the Mission
   is willing to store them for the government,
   I would suggest to the Department to
   lease them in their present condition
   until the Consulate be re-opened.</p>

<p> Even after my exist of office and
   return to the States, the Department will
   always find me most willing to serve
   the government with my experience and
   knowledge of Angola and African
   matters generally.</p>

<p> "Care of the Smithsonian Institution"
   will always find me.
        I have the honor to be, Sir,
                your obedient servant

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
              Assistant Secretary of State,
                                           Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I am sorry to have to inform you of
   Mr. Ed. Bannister's irregular conduct in
   various matters:</p>

<p>(1) In the settlement of Judson's estates
   he kept some money (about $100.-) which
   I already mentioned in a previous dispatch,
   and which I doubt he ever paid to the
   Treasury; and he refused to return to me
   some papers he had asked of me for said
   settlement.</p>

<p>(2) Unbeknown to me he corresponded
    as U.S. Vice-Consul with the Chicago Exhibition,
    bought and sent to them a native cause and
    machila, telling the people at Loanda that
    my appointment as Commercial Agent did
    not interfere with his as Vice-Consul.
    (3) I hear that since my departure</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90020.jpg"/>

<p>and the closing of the Consulate officially
   made known in the government's official 
   Bulletin for Angola, he still claim to be
   and signs himself as U.S. Vice-Consul.
   (4) This is the more reprehensible as Mr.
   Bannister is acting British Consul at
   Loanda and appointed British Consul for
   the Kongo Free State.</p>

<p>     It might be well for the Department
   to stop Mr. Bannister's unlawful use 
   of said title by informing the public of
   Angola through the Governor and the Official
   Bulletin that Mr. Bannister has no
   right to act as, or call himself, U.S.
   Vice-Consul.
            I am, Sir,
                        your obedient servant
                             Heli Chatelain</p>
