<p>Sir:
        In reply to your letter of this

        relations with the United States, to discount

<p>To Henry F. Downing, Esq.
     U.S. Consul,
        St. Paul de Loanda,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th
            inst., with refinance to your Consular drafts; the
            reason we object to your drafts, is that we have
            no business with America, and pay commission for
            collecting and remitting to England, costs
            us a considerable amount, and such drafts
            are of little use to us as a remittance in a 
            commercial way.</p>

<p>         If you could give us drafts on
            England, we should be happy to take <unclear/>
            at par and think the movement will have
            no difficulty in this, having agents in London.
                <unclear/> are dear Sir,
                    Yours truly,
                        Newton, Carnegie & Co.</p>

<p>United States Consulate
    St. Paul de Loanda
    January 12th, 1888</p>

<p>Con H.L. Rives,
     Assistant Secrtary of State
        Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to submit
    to the Department the following:
        The desire of our people to 
    intend this foreign trade is inducing
    them to look towards this and adjoining 
    parts of Africa as a possible field
    for cultivation. If this is true, it is well
    for them to know that while it is by 
    no means impossible for them to secure
    a valuable market here, there are many
    obstaclces to overcome, the greatest of which
    is inexperience but an examination
    of the methods of other countries will
    teach them much.
        The commercial nations of 
    Europe recognizing that the success
                                    of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0008.jpg"/>

<p>of endeavor in these parts depended
   upon a knowledge of its people, adopted
    a system the wisdom of which is paved
    by their large and successful dealings,
    and, if our peopleact upon the the belief
    that they can conduct their <unclear/>
    under different rules, they are making
    a mistake which will cost them dear,
    for costly experiment will only prove
    the value of England.and Germany's
    methods.</p>
    
<p>     An internale knowleddge of the
    people, their wants and their habits in
    a necessity, this is to be had only by
    contact and American resident represen
    tatives of houses, learning the dialects <unclear/>
    is of first importance; for often, the 
    purchase of produce, ddoes not so much
    defend upon the quality of the goods,
    as it does upon the the <unclear/> of the
    trades.</p>

<p>     As all or any of their habits
    may be of value as guides to a study
    of their character. I have taken this 
    method of describing a few of those
                                customs.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0009.jpg"/>

<p>customs which are more or less general.</p>

<p>     That part of this country
    which is on the coast live and between
    Lat. 5º South, and Lat. 15º 20… South
    contains some twenty different tribes.
    Then again are divided and subdiversed
    and, while in some respects are alike that
    are many points of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>     When referring to the habits
    and customs of these natives, attention
    is drawn to the question of slavery; but
    as practiced by them, it takes a com=
    plexion so mild that it crries with it
    amongst them, no hardships. Their laws
    make it a necessity for the owner to
    give them every care, attend to them where
    sick, food and clothethem, bury and marry
    and happiness in every direction, and so
    little difference is made, that the owners
    in speaking of their slaves, call them,
    son or daughter.</p>

<p>     The peaceful dispositions
    of these coast tribe prevents war from
    beign a <unclear/> for the ranks of
                                slavery</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0010.jpg"/>

<p>slavery, but these are found through
    the workings of their laws, which are
    strict, a plentitude of victims. Offices
    against property are causes for slavery or
    death, any one caught stealing <unclear/>
    be he who he may, chief or subject, the
    property of the one stolen from the most
    trivial things; for instance, spitting on
    another shoe, is looked upon as a heinous
    crime deserving of death or slavery.</p>
