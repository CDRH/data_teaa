<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Loanda, December 5, 1888.</p>

<p>Honorable G. L. Rives,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit
to the Department the Inventory
of the private effects of the lake Mr
Judson which I value at about
$100.00/100 to $120.00/100 if sold here.</p>

<p>His debts, as far as I can find
and through an advertisement I 
put in the papers here, are as
follows:</p>

<table>
<row>
<cell>Arias Fonseca &amp; Co. for food</cell>
<cell>$26 30/100</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>Restaurant Club " liquors</cell>

<cell>2 93/100</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>Rest of Consulate</cell>
<cell>52 18/100</cell>
</row>
</table>

<p>Being for months April and May, not
paid, also for October and November</p>

<table>
<row>
<cell>Funeral expenses</cell>
<cell>84 35/100</cell>
</row>
</table>

<p>I think the rest of the Consulate
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30009.jpg"/>

and the Funeral Expenses (paid by
me) ought to be repaid to me by the
Department, the house having been
rented in the name of the Government, 
and I having assumed
the responsibility of the burial,
however I await the reply of the 
Department authorizing me to draw 
for the same.</p>

<p>A Mr. Steele has presented
himself from Cabinda, as co-manager
with Mr. Judson of Bishop Taylor's
mission there, Mr. Judson having 
been Superintendent of same. They
were also engaged in a small business
there together. Mr. MacLean of
Bishop Taylor's mission here, certifies
to the above description of Mr. Steele
and as he has a better opportunity
of selling the effects for better prices
there than we can get here, I intend
handing over to him such effects for
sale, he guaranteeing to hand to me 
the proceeds, as sold. I hope I
have done right in this as I am
<catchwords>afraid</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_300010.jpg"/>

afraid if I were to sell them here
they would not bring the valve I
have placed on them as old clothes.</p>

<p>A wooden box also exists
belonging to a Sailor of an American
Whaler, name unknown, also a 
tin trunk marked No 5, supposed
to have been left by a man named 
Cameron when on a journey into 
the interior, and not yet claimed,
contents as per inventory.</p>

<p>I can find no account book
or letter book to show if any money
is owing to him, or if he had any 
account with any one here, and
no one has offered to pay me anything 
on his account in response
to my advertisement.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Robt S. Newton<lb/>
Vice Consul.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose
copy of a letter I addressed to the President
of the United States Government on the 1st 
June 1883 since which date I have not
been honored with a reply, and have acted
as Acting United States Consul, and United
States Vice Consul on occasions since then
at this place and as Mr Vice Consul
Robert Scott Newton leaves for England
permanently in August next, I venture to
crave Your Excellency's kind indulgence
for the appointment as Acting United States
<catchwords>Consul</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_300019.jpg"/>

Consul on Vice Consul in his place</p>

<p>I beg to draw Your Excellency's
attention to the fact that I have faithfully
served the United States Government on 
many occasions; and venture to hope that
in view of Mr. Newton's retirement and
of the experience I have had here, that
Your Excellency will give my request your
serious and kind attention.</p>

<p>My agent in London will
send Your Excellency copies of my several 
nominations here</p>

<p>and awaiting Your Excellency's
gracious reply,</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I beg most respectfully to
address Your Excellency through advice of Mr.
Consul L de R du Verge, and to enclose 
originals of two documents in my possession
when acting as Vice Consul for the United
States of America, and as British Consul at
St. Paul de Loanda and I crave Your Excellency's
kind attention to my request and to the facts
as follows:</p>

<p>I have been in St Paul de Loanda
upwards of five years with Messieurs Newton
Carnegie &amp; Co, Merchants of that city and left
in March last on account of ill health, and
<catchwords>not</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_300021.jpg"/>

not being desirous of returning to that place,
but to one a little more salubrious, venture
to beg of Your Excellency the appointment as
representation of the United States Government
at some other place should there be a vacancy.</p>

<p>When passing the Cape de Verde
Islands I had the pleasure of meeting the
American Consul there (at St. Thiago) who
told me he had suffered greatly of late
through fevers, and did not feel at all satisfied,
and desired to leave as soon as possible.
Should this be the case I may say that
Your Excellency could rely upon my faithfully
fulfilling the duties of that post, I being
thoroughly conversant with the Portuguese
language, and well acquainted with the
inhabitants of that Island, and where am
<catchwords>very</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_300022.jpg"/>

very desirous of going if possible</p>

<p>During my stay with Messieurs
Newton Carnegie &amp; Co at Loanda I had ample
time to study the duties of the Consulate, and
often performed same under Vice Consul
Robert Scott Newton's supervision.</p>

<p>It has long been my earnest
desire to serve the American Government and
should Your Excellency deem it advisable to
grant me an appointment at S Thiago or 
any other port. I can only say that I
shall always have the interests of the
Government at heart, and endeavor in every
way to prove myself worthy of the honor, conferred
upon us. I am 25 years of age, and
should Your Excellency desire a personal
interview I shall be only too happy to cross
the Atlantic whenever Your Excellency may
demand

<pb facs="ViewScan_300023.jpg"/>

demand it, and are prepared to leave England
at any time</p>

<p>Honorable<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In reply to the circular from
the Department, dated November 25,
I have the honor to report:</p>

<p>1st. There are no refrigerators
in this Consular district.</p>

<p>2nd. Being unacquainted with 
the construction of them or their
operation under different conditions,
I cannot say if any peculiar
feature would be requisite for
this district, unless it might be 
that the machine ought to be an
ice-making one and refrigerator
combined.</p>

<p>3rd Answered in first paragraph.</p>

<p>4th " " " "</p>

<p>5th There are a few, not more
<catchwords>than</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_400013.jpg"/>

three or four small French ice-machines 
in use here, and not 
one of them is capable of turning
out more than may be, two or
three kilos of ice per day. They
are seldom put to such use however,
the cooling of water being the
usual content of their services.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the charge
would be per 100 lb of ice if that
quantity could be produced here
for sale. I can however say that
for about a quart of lemonade
made of lime-juice, sugar and
this machine cooled water a charge
of thirty cents is made. Value of lime
juice and sugar
5 cents.</p>

<p>A machine turning out 100 to
200 kilos of block-ice per day,
(refrigerator combined) would
meet the present wants of this city.</p>

<p>The principal hotel proprietor
of the place. Mr F. Frugier, is 
anxious to purchase such a
machine, but not at prompt
payment, as his capital is very,
<catchwords>limited</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40014.jpg"/>

limited. He suggests payment of
a certain proportion on delivery
and rest by instalments.</p>

<p>I would suggest that catalogues
with designs be forwarded to me, 
stating price, cost of working
to produce 100 to 200 kilos of ice,
and in fact such necessary
particulars as will enable me 
to lay the matter clearly before
people who might become purchasers.</p>

<p>There are no means here of
preserving food and liquids
and if the cost does not bar the
<unclear>way</unclear>, the introduction of refrigerators
would be a boon to many, as meat
turns bad here in twenty four hours.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Mr. Newton, the Vice Consul
at this port, having informed me
that he will probably not return to 
Africa for some time, I have the 
honour to submit to you my application
for the appointment.</p>

<p>I was acting Vice Consul for a few
months during the year 1887, have
been in charge again since the 15th
of August of last year, and have
at different times assisted Mr. Newton
during his incumbency, and thus 
gained a knowledge of the duties of
the office.</p>

<p>I have been in Mr. Newton's
employ several years, and as he
has been favorably known to the
Department for a period extending
over twenty years, I have no doubt
his endorsement of my application

<pb facs="ViewScan_40016.jpg"/>

will have due influence with you.</p>

<p>My bond already exists in the

can have a new one duly executed.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the
Department that my leave of absence
expires on the 30th inst, and as my
health will not permit me to 
return to the Coast for some time,
I feel it my duty to tender my
resignation as Vice Consul.
From my experience of the two last
Consuls sent to Loanda, I take
the Liberty to suggest to the
Department that it would be
advisable to have a resident
Vice Consul of experience at
Loanda, whether another Consul
may be appointed or not, and
would recommend the nomination
of Mr. Edward Bannister who is
at present acting for me.</p>

<p>Reply to claim, and grounds

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, November 19, 1890</p>

<p>Honorable W. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
 Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your despatch dated
September 11, 1890, enclosing a copy 
of a letter from Mrs Adelaide W
Holmes to the Department of
State in which that lady claims
the sum of <unclear>Rs</unclear> 360.00 for property
belonging to her late husband
and alleged by her to have been 
robbed from the Cabin of the barque
"Sea Fox" (of which vessel he was
Captain) when the arrived in Loanda
and was placed in the charge of the 
officials of the Port. This claim she
makes on the ground of the "inefficiency
or <del>incompetency</del> neglect" of the Consul at
Loanda.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40023.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 2 -->

<p>The whole of the Sad circumstances
attending the explosion on board
the vessel in question were reported
at the time by Vice Consul Newton
to the Department. I will therefore
confine my reply, to the allegations
contained in the claim set forth.</p>

<p>1st "That with the assistance
of a Portuguese national vessel
their <unclear>lying</unclear> in or near Equimina
the "Sea Fox" was taken to St. Paul
de Loanda."</p>

<p>The Portuguese national
vessel took a number of burnt
and wounded men to Loanda
but had nothing to do with taking
the ship there. The Vice Consul
sent a man by the Earliest opportunity
to bring her to this port.</p>

<p>2nd "That at the instance of said
consul or through his agency, Customs
officers were put on board the said
"Sea Fox""</p>

<p>The Customs officers were sent
on board by the Director of Customs
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40024.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 7 -->

verifying the truth of such 
alleged conversation. Considering
however the character of Mr
Newton, the conscientious manner
in which he performed the duties
of this Consulate for a period
extending over twenty years as
I gather from the archives, and
his willingness at all times to
assist in getting justice done
even where he is not personally
concerned, confirm me in the
opinion that either the whole
truth regarding such reply of
his as alleged, is suppressed, or
that it is entirely imaginary
on the part of Captain Luce
or whoever is responsible
for the statement.</p>

<p>To establish the claim I again
submit that it is necessary
for the claimant to produce
the list "as scheduled by the
Consul or his Agent" duly
authenticated by the signature
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40025.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 8 -->

of such Consul or Agent; and 
in conclusion would ask if 
the Consul is responsible to the
owners for safe delivery of property
from the time their agent takes
change in a foreign port until 
he delivers such property in the
home port. If any robbery was 
committed it may have been
done in such interval.</p>

<p>I trust the Department
will accept my assurance 
that all the foregoing is simply
in answer to the claim and the
terms in which it is made, and
I should regret very much if
any single phrase should be
construed as showing a want
of the high respect due from 
me to the Department.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your most obedient<lb/>
servant<lb/>
Ed Bannister.<lb/>
Vice Consul.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40026.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 3 -->

<p>as is done according to law in every
case of arrival of a vessel in port,
and the Consul has nothing whatever
to do with such proceeding.</p>

<p>3rd "And that during the 
time the ship was in charge of the
said officials, the Captain's entire
effects, previously scheduled by the
Consul or his agent, and consisting
of clothing &amp;c, &amp;c. were stolen and
taken from the ship."</p>

<p>When the vessel arrived here
the V Consul was at Mossamedes
very ill, and the writer acting
for him, immediately proceeded
on board and found the entire
space which had once been occupied
by the Cabin, a black, foul smelling
hole without a vestige of Cabin
from side to side and from deck
to Keelson, the result of the explosion,
and the fire consequent thereon
which the crew said raged for
some time.</p>

<p>Burnt and otherwise mutilated
<catchwords>portions</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40027.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 4 -->

portions of written matter,
unrecognizable as documents
of importance or otherwise, were 
<unclear>lying</unclear> scattered about the desk
which was shewn with wreckage
caused by the explosion. On my 
asking if anything belonging
to the Captain had been saved
(simply with a view to secure
for his friends some souvenir),
the reply was in the following
terms as far as my memory
serves me, and I know that at 
the time if made a great impression
on me, considering the awful
circumstances: "My God
Sir, do you think any one thought
of anything else when he recovered
from the shock but putting
out the fire and saving the
ship from going right down
under us"</p>

<p>There remained more than
20 men of the crew, and they
demanded to be taken ashore

<pb facs="ViewScan_40028.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 5 -->

and provided for. I had to
make provision for them (they
had neither food nor place to 
sleep in), and also provide
for the ship's safety and that
of her cargo. The man who 
brought the vessel from Equimina
said he would not have gone
for her if he had known what
he would have to put up with.
He had to sleep (when he could)
on the open deck, there was 
no food except a little fish
and sweet potatoes, and when
he arrived here he was in a
high state of fever.</p>

<p>I would ask respectfully
if under such circumstances
the Consul's duty was to hurt
up a few trinkets or other articles
(which I am firmly convinced
did not exist), or do his duty
by the ship, her cargo and the 
crew?</p>

<p>"The Captain's entire effects
<catchwords>previously</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40029.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 6 -->

previously scheduled by the
Consul or his agent."</p>

<p>I will refrain from making
any comment on this assertion,
but respectfully ask the Department
to demand from the concocters
of this claim the list of effects
"scheduled by the Consul or
his Agent" with the signature
of the Consul, or his agent attached.</p>

<p>4th. "And that upon representation
of the robbery being made to the 
Consul by the Captain who had
been sent to St Paul de Loanda
to bring the ship to her home
port, the Consul replied that
nothing could he done about"
it".</p>

<p>This of course implies that
a list as set forth in the claim
and "as scheduled by the Consul"
or his agent" really existed. Let
them produce it. In the
absence of Mr Newton, late 
Vice Consul, I have no means of
<catchwords>verifying</catchwords>    </p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>To avoid confusion in my plan of work, I should
know before setting what the limits of the Commercial
Agency of St. Paul de Loanda are. According to
paragraph 30 of the Consular Regulation I understand
them to embrace all of the two Provinces of (a) Angola
(b) S. Thomé and Principe; for the latter is nearer
Loanda then San Tiago, the next northern U.S.
Consulate in Portuguese territory.</p>

<note>No. 1</note>

<p>Report
on the need of direct steam communication 
between the United States
and Africa.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>General Facts and Conclusions</p>

<p>(1) The industry and commerce of the U.S. 
need: (a) raw material for the factories 
(b) a market for the overproduction 
of manufactures.</p>

<p>(2) A look at Africa's extent and untapped 
resources prove that it will be,
in the near future, the greatest producer
of raw material, the greatest consumer
of foreign manufacturers, and the best field
for skilled labor.</p>

<p>(3) The U.S. has the advantage over
any other nation in its possibilities as
a consumer of African produce and a producer 
of material needed for the upbuilding
of Africa's civilization.</p>

<p>(4) Geographically, the distance between
the U.S. and W. Africa (south of the
Sahara) is not greater then that between

<pb facs="ViewScan_50007.jpg"/>

England or Germany and West Africa.
Nor are the Cape Verde Islands any
farther removed from the U.S. than
are England and Germany.</p>

<p>(5) Within five or six years the tonnage
between England, Germany, Portugal,
and W. Africa has more than doubled,
while France and Belgium, and also
private firms, leave added new lines
to said coast.</p>

<p>(6) The U.S. shipping to Africa, which
was considerable previous to the river, has
steadily decreased, solely because steam
has not been added to sail, and
because other lines from Europe have 
been allowed to draw the trade
over the doubly long route of England
and Germany.</p>

<p>(7) The present exchange of productions
and movement of passengers between
American and Africa, including what
goes via England, Portugal and Germany 
would suffice to warrant the
establishment of a modern line of steamers, 
but the best would follow its <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50008.jpg"/>

<p>(8) At present it takes letters from
Angola and Congo from six to eight
weeks to reach New York. A line
of steamers going direct to Cape Verde
Islands, and thence down the Coast
at the average rate of trading steamers
would reach Liberia in a fortnight
and the Congo and Angola in eight
to twelve days more; that is in
half the time now required.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Personal observations</p>

<p>(1) I have sailed, or rather steamed, 
four times along the West Coast of
Africa, seeing all points of any importance 
between <del>the</del> Madeira and
Mossamedes, at the southern extremity 
of Angola. Never had I a chance to
travel on an American trading vessel:
the first outward-bound voyage I made
(in 85) by the British and African S.S.
Line, the second on the U.S.S.
"Pensacola"; the first northward trip
I made on Portuguese man of war
"Africa" and the second on the Portu-

<pb facs="ViewScan_50009.jpg"/>

guese packet to St. Vincent (Porto Grande)
and thence by tramp-steamer to Philadelphia.
The first voyage from Liverpool to Loanda
took almost eight weeks. The last voyage
from Loanda to Philadelphia took <del>about</del>
twenty one days; exclusive of 5 days stoppage
at S. Thomé and three days at St. Vincent.</p>

<p>My mission being scientific and <unclear extent="one word"/>
only such commercial facts as forced
themselves on me were noticed and 
can now be collected. A special study
would reveal much more hopeful indications.</p>

<p>(2) The Cape Verde Islands</p>

<p>At St. Vincent, Mr. Randall, father,
who was a long time U.S. Consular Agt
remembers the time when Port Grande
was a miserable hamlet of fisher-huts.
Now it is a large town and one of the 
guest harbors of the world. Nearly all
the houses are covered in shingles, and
these as well as the timber come from 
America.</p>

<p>Here the bark of Mr. <unclear>Betman</unclear> of Boston,

<pb facs="ViewScan_50010.jpg"/>

of W. H. Mitchell, N.Y. and probably
that of Yates and Porterfield, touch
at regular intervals on their way to
Dakar, Goree and Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>The Cape Verde Islanders, as many 
of them told me, are more American
than Portuguese. Every man, who gets
a chance, wants to see the U.S.A.
great many are U.S. citizens, having 
been nationalized as sailor on American
vessels. I know of a sailing vessel that
<unclear>salled</unclear> at Brava and got there a
full cargo of passengers at 50 dollars.
A direct line of steamers can reckon
on a regular supply of passengers to 
and from the U.S. and Cape Verde Islands.
As a winter resort some of these Island
will soon vie with Madeira, the Azores
and the Canaries. Americans would no
doubt soon prefer them to Madeira at
the Canaries.</p>

<p>The reports of the U.S. Consul at Santiago 
ought to show that there is now 
some direct and indirect export from
Cape Verde Islands to the U.S.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50011.jpg"/>

<p>(3) Senegambia and Sierra Leone</p>

<p>The above mentioned American firms
are constantly sending there some bark
and I suppose the Department is better
informed than I on the business they 
do.</p>

<p>(4) Liberia</p>

<p>The connection of this colony of ours
with the motherland and European
nations is too well known for me
to dwell on it. Liberia alone would 
furnish enough passengers and freight
movement to support a small steamer
and many others to follow, if the 
custom barrier between mother and
daughter were lowered.</p>

<p>(5) Gold Coast, Niger, Cameroons,
Gaboon, S. Thomé, and Congo</p>

<p>Wherever I have been, at all
points of the Coast and Islands I
have found the same desire of
traders wishing to get goods direct
from America, of shipping produce
in the same way, and of educated
nations wishing to get passage to the

<pb facs="ViewScan_50012.jpg"/>

"big country" not to settle there, but
to learn its ways.</p>

<p>There is no conception in America
of the immense resources of all 
kinds stood up in those regions, nor 
of the mysterious, magnet like, power of attraction
this republic exerts on the minds of
Africans the moment they emerge from
tribal isolation. </p>

<p>(6) Angola</p>

<p>In this province, which is regularly
visited by the monthly lines of Germany 
and France, the tri-weekly of England,
and the bi-weekly of Portugal, the 
need of direct steam communication
with the U.S. seems to be realized 
with the clearest consciousness, especially
since the recent troubles with England.
One Jewish firm charting every year
a few sailing vessels to bring lumber,
kerosene, flour, furniture etc. from
the States and the profits it realizes 
are larger than it is willing to confess.
The Schooner "Horace Scudder" that 
used to visit all ports of Angola

<pb facs="ViewScan_50013.jpg"/>

yearly, will a mixed cargo of American 
goods, has been greatly missed for this
last few years. A whole batch of
traders used planters are already now
writing to me of their intention to visit
the Chicago Fair and to see with
with their own eyes how best to establish
and extend direct commercial relations
with this country.</p>

<p>As soon as I reach my post, I
hope to be able to give exact statistics
of the important agriculture and trade
and of the immense resources of that
large province.</p>

<p>(7) Cape Colony (and South African
Republics</p>

<p>Considering that the water route
between the U.S. and the Cape and
that between England and the Cape
are practically equal, there is no
reason why this country could not
compete on that promising market
in all those articles in which it
does compete in Europe.</p>

<p>Nor should the deep sympathy

<pb facs="ViewScan_50014.jpg"/>

between the <unclear extent="one word"/> United States
of South-Africa and their model
on this hemisphere be forgotten.</p>

<p>(8) Summing my observation
on all the West-Coast I may state</p>

<p>(a) that all this lumber, kerosene,
flour, and canned meats that is used
on the West-Coast comes directly or
indirectly from America.</p>

<p>Lately, however, Norwegia is has begun to seriously
compete with America in the lumber
trade.</p>

<p>(b) In cotton-goods (which form the
most important article of importation
in Africa), preserved fruit and meats
(especially corned beef and salt pork)
in machinery for agriculture, tools
and implements of all kinds, rolling
stock for railways, cheap clock and
watches, cheap furniture, notions
and intentions of all kinds, patent
<unclear>mediums</unclear>, etc. the United States
can compete with other nations as
soon as the goods have not to
travel over England and Germany.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50015.jpg"/>

<p>(c) The main produce of Africa, as it
is now, india-rubber, ivory, pea-nuts,
skins, wax, dye stuffs, ginger, <unclear>cainwood</unclear>, 
coffee, cocoa, kola-nuts &amp; fibres, etc.
are all wanted in the U.S. as much
as in Europe.</p>

<p>Whether palm-oil would find here
as good a market as in Europe I
cannot say but I don't see why it
should not.</p>

<p>(d) As to the quantity its sufficiency is proved by the fact that
steamers have rapidly increased in
size and number so that now there
are ten regular lines of steamers, besides
a number belonging to Coast trading firms
when six or seven years ago there
was only the English line with
the then modest beginnings of the
now powerful German line.</p>

<p>(9) American missionaries in Africa</p>

<p>Exclusive of the United Presbyterian
in Egypt, who would never use
the Africa lines, there are now
in Africa American missionaries
representing 18 religious organizations</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50016.jpg"/>

<p>1. The United Brethren, with their prosperous,
Colony-like mission among the Mende
of Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>2. The Kansas Soudan Mission of the Y.M.C.A.
with coast-station at Sierra Leone</p>

<p>3. Wesleyan Methodists at Sierra Leone</p>

<p>4. Free Methodists in Sierra Leone, and
Liberia, and East-Coast and going to extend to Congo
and other parts.</p>

<p>5. African Methodist Episcopal in 
Liberia</p>

<p>6. Methodist Episcopal in Liberia, Congo,
Angola.</p>

<p>7. Protestant Episcopal in Liberia.</p>

<p>8. Lutherans in Liberia.</p>

<p>9. Mormonites in Liberia.</p>

<p>10. Southern Baptists in Yorubaland</p>

<p>11. Northern Presbyterians in German
Cameroons, and French Gaboon and
Spanish Corisco.</p>

<p>12. Southern Presbyterian on Congo</p>

<p>13. Northern Baptists on Congo</p>

<p>14. Christian Alliance on Congo</p>

<p>15. American Board in Angola, and
East-Africa, and Zululand</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50017.jpg"/>

<p>16. Swedish Lutherans on Congo.</p>

<p>17. Friends in Madagascar</p>

<p>18. Roman Catholics, in different fields.</p>

<p>To these should be added a 
number independent missionaries.
The total number of these missionaries
is set down as 204; but it is really
considerably higher, for the women 
are not included in that enumeration.
These American missionaries are 
assisted in their work by more than
600 native evangelists. The money
expended on these American and native missionaries 
is more than 250,000 <unclear>1/100</unclear>
per year.</p>

<p>There are enough indications to make
it almost certain That next year
will see an unprecedented rush of
American missionaries to African so
that the above number will soon
be doubled and trebled.</p>

<p>Now, almost to a man, these missionaries 
with their families travel via
England and bring their outfit and
that of their stations in Europe,
simply because there is no direct
line of steamers</p>

<p>U.S. Commercial Agency<lb/>
at St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
Lisbon, July 24, 1891</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>
to the Hon. William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to report my
arrival at this port, en route to
St. Paul de Loanda, and to mention 
some of the difficulties met 
on this route.</p>

<p>1) The shortest, or rather quickest,
route to Angola (St. Paul de Loanda)
is that of the Portuguese mail,
provided one is able to find suitable
communication between England and

<pb facs="ViewScan_50024.jpg"/>

Portugal. I had read of the project,
or decision, of having steamers sail
from Lisbon to Loanda on the 21st
and 6th of each month; but not being
sure, I determined to inquire in
New York. Here the Portuguese Consul
knew only of the departures on the 6th;
Cook's Agency <unclear>idem</unclear>. I sailed to 
England by first opportunity in
order to find out there, both about
the Lisbon packets for Loanda and
the steamers from England to Loanda.</p>

<p>2) In England I learnt that there 
is indeed a steamer leaving Lisbon
on the 21st and there I might
catch it by one of the Southampton
steamers, all of whom were due in Lisbon
about the some time.</p>

<p>3) The time for the connection being

<pb facs="ViewScan_50025.jpg"/>

very limited, and the required
custom house despatches and visas
of Passport taking to much time,
the steamer of the 21st was missed
and I must wait for the next 
one of the 6th of August, which is
due in Loanda about the 1st of
September.</p>

<p>Besides the visa of the American
Consulate I was obliged to get
another from the Police of the Port
which cost 2.800 reis <unclear extent="one word"/> that
is a little over three dollars. My
baggage had to go through the same
process as that of non-consuls, and
I found that <del>most</del> Portuguese officials think
a Commercial Agent is nothing more
than a Consular Agent.</p>

<p>The result of my experience is that

<pb facs="ViewScan_50026.jpg"/>

although the British and African lines
from Liverpool to Loanda is not the 
most direct nor the quickest in
theory (in the time actually spent
at sea) yet it is the most convenient 
both as regards speed,
comfort and economy, because the
correspondence between the steamer
from America and that going to 
Loanda can easily be arranged
from America, and there is no
custom house delay nor pass-port
expense etc., to the English
steamers do not call at Lisbon.</p>

<p>4) I am improving the fortright I
am forced to spend here, in getting
useful information on the subject
of commercial possibilities between
my consulate and <del>Angola</del> America, and

<pb facs="ViewScan_50027.jpg"/>

on the plains and purposes of the
colonial centre at Lisbon with regard
to this African colonies. In the present 
crisis, however, nobody knows
what may happen in the nearest
future.</p>

<p>I found the people at Oporto
deeply and seriously excited and
here the highest and lowest clans 
are, so to say carelessly, in response on the "<unclear extent="one word"/>"
looking out for "somebody to do
something or anything", but no one
knows who is to do it, nor what 
is to be done.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>

<p>To Hon. William F. Wharton<lb/>

Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose the Report
on U.S. Coaling-stations in Africa
referred to in our interview when I 
left Washington, and to beg you to transmit 
the same to the Navy Department</p>

<p>This Report tries to show what points
are most desirable as coaling-stations
and may possibly be acquired by 
the United States.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Commercial Agent</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50030.jpg"/>

<p>Enclosure No. 1</p>

<p>Report on U.S. Coaling-stations
in Africa, their desirability,
<unclear>possibility</unclear> and suitable points.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50031.jpg"/>

<p>Report
on Coaling-stations in Africa.</p>

<p>(1) The desirability of coaling stations
for the U.S. Navy on several points
of Africa is best understood, no
doubt, by the Navy Department, and
needs not to be dwelt upon.</p>

<p>(2) Some of the desirable, and probably 
acquirable, points are the following:</p>

<p>a) Fayal, or some other point on 
one of the Azores. The whole population 
of the Azores would rejoice to
see the U.S. acquire some land in 
their islands, and the Portuguese Government 
might not object persistently 
in the present state of affairs</p>

<p>b) Some port of the Cape Verde Islands,
where the whole population is also

<pb facs="ViewScan_50032.jpg"/>

most favorably disposed toward the
United States.</p>

<p>(c) An island, or the whole, of Portuguese
Guinea. The sale or abandonment of 
this colony, which has given Portugal nothing 
but trouble and expense, has often
been demanded by Portuguese statesmen
even when the national finances were
in a relatively flourishing condition.
If anything could be got for for it, there
is little doubt that the Portuguese government 
and "Cortes" would hail with
joy an honorable opportunity of
parting with that irksome colonial
appendage. Under American administration 
there need be no fear of 
rebellions like that which the Portuguese 
have recently had to deal with.
I think that possession is both the

<pb facs="ViewScan_50033.jpg"/>

most promising for a good administration, 
and the one that can be obtained
on the most favorable terms. The Navy 
Department is the best judge of its
excellency as far as geographical
situation and anchorage are concerned
The climate is, whatever some may
say, not a bit worse than that of 
the British and French possessions
to the north and south of it.</p>

<p>d) Some land might be obtained
on the Principe and St. Thomas Islands,
but Cabinda, just north of the
Congo mouth, is by far the most
desirable point of the whole coast
and could probably be acquired
either as a whole or, at least, in
part. Portugal has already spent
more money on it than it is worth

<pb facs="ViewScan_50034.jpg"/>

to a nation that holds so much
valuable lands, and there is no prospect 
of Portugal extending is as
the expense of either the Congo State
or France. The American fleet of whaling
vessels has for many years make
Cabinda this gathering point, and
the sea-faring Cabindas are well
acquainted with American ships.</p>

<p>This concludes the list of the
available places under the Portuguese
flag and situated on the West-Coast
I know from personal friends connected 
with more Portuguese statesmen 
and from the discussion of
the subject in the "Cortes" that
the best solution, (if a solution be
possible) of the present financial
crisis would be found in these

<pb facs="ViewScan_50035.jpg"/>

sale of superfluous colonies or territories, 
and that the United States
would have the preferences. Only
it is considered inconsistent with
the national dignity to make the
first other. But overtures of the
U.S. on this subject would be welcomed, 
and the mission of Sr. Arroyo
to the U.S. for other objects could
be utilised for negotiations of this 
sort.</p>

<p>It does not look as though there
would be any insuperable difficulty
in obtaining from the Portuguese
some harbor of their East-African
possession.</p>

<p>e) Of the Spanish possessions in
West-Africa, which have no promising 
future before them unless they

<pb facs="ViewScan_50036.jpg"/>

fall into better hands, a point of
Fernando Po might be ceded to the 
U.S. as well as to Germany, who
already has a coaling station on that
large island. But Coriaco and Benito, where
the missionaries of the American
Presbyterian Church (North) have been,
and still are, the only pioneers of
civilization and Christianity, and where
important congregation of <unclear extent="one word"/>
have already been gathered, would
seem to be every way a more bearable
site. The island of Anno Bom,
too whose most regular visitors are
our American whaling ships, and
which is to Spain a main source
of expense, might prove to be a 
good place for the object in view.</p>

<p>f) Finally Liberia, our ward

<pb facs="ViewScan_50037.jpg"/>

and the light-house of the rising
African (native) states, would probably 
welcome the moral support which
the pressure of a U.S. coaling station
would offer it. Still, some of the
preceding points seem to be preferable,
principally Portuguese Guinea (Bissau
and Bolama) Cabinda or Corisco.</p>

<p>The present crisis or Portugal
which cannot last long, at least
in this acute stage, offers the
best, and possibly the last,
opportunity for the acquisition
of desirable points for coaling-stations 
on the route from America
to Europe (Azores) South Africa,
India and Australia. One 
of the Azores, Portuguese Guinea
and Cabinda would form a

<pb facs="ViewScan_50038.jpg"/>

splendid chain both for our
Navy and our coming merchant
navy to Africa.</p>

<p>I shall gladly furnish any
more information that may be
desired on the subject of this
Report, and past my personal
influence with the Portuguese, and
fearlessness of African climate, at 
the disposal of our government 
for the attainment of the objects 
in question.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States,
at St. Paul de Loanda, Sept 1st, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you
that I arrived at my post yesterday
Aug. 31st by S.S. "Ambaca" exactly 
62 days after sailing from New 
York and that I have taken charge
of this Consulate to-day.</p>

<p>The Governor General of Angola had
already announced my appointment
and permission to act in the official
Bulletin of Aug. 22d.</p>

<p>The archives of the Consulate were transferred 
to me by Vice-Consul Ed. Bannister, 
and we have together made the
enclosed Inventory of the same according 
to the directions contained in the Consular 
Regulations.</p>

<p>Pending the choice of a definite location

<pb facs="ViewScan_50041.jpg"/>

I have taken a temporary office at
the house of a reliable friend. The 
partition in Mr. Newton's office, which
was formerly used for the U.S. Consulate
I found already occupied by the British
Consulate.</p>

<p>I also have to advise my drafts
on the Hon. Secretary of the Treasury,
one of the $82.90, for the period of instructions 
and another of $136.99, for my
transit, both in <unclear extent="on word"/> of Bywater, Tanqueray &amp; Phayre Ld. 17 Broadway, New York.
As you already know, it was
not possible for me to reach my
destination within the determined
50 days, nor have my predecessor, that
I know of, been able to do so.</p>

<p>In spite of two years of drought and
consequent scarcity of food, I find Loanda
much improved and commerce flourishing
This is due to the railroad and the 
good prices fetched by native produce.</p>

<p>The political crisis is becoming so
acute, that a joint movement of Portuguese 
and natives for Angolan independence 
is imminent, nor is it probable 
that the Lisbon government would

<pb facs="ViewScan_50042.jpg"/>

or could seriously oppose such a
change. In a great meeting,
the leading man of Loanda, irrespective 
of party or color, have protested 
against the cession of the Lunda
to the Congo State, and resolved to
frustrate the permission given the
same State to contract 500 natives
in Angola. And they have done
it so effectually that the Congo State
Agent has withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Department shall soon hear
more on these subjects.</p>

<p>As, to my knowledge, there
is no American Consul on the Congo,
I take the liberty to inform the
Department of the decease at Vivi,
on the 12th Aug. of Christian
Borella a native of Denmark
and naturalized American citizen.</p>

<p>After a long career of usefulness
in and out of the employ of the
New York Seamen's Missionary 
Society, Borella sailed about
three years ago, for Liberia. Fever-

<pb facs="ViewScan_50043.jpg"/>

worn he took a trip to Cape-Town,
and thence came to Loanda, whence
he went to the inland stations of
Bishop Taylor's Mission. He was 
appointed Captain of Bishop Taylor's
steamer on the Lower Congo, and
went there, though debilitated.
On Aug. 10th he was seized by 
haematuric fever, and on the 12th following, 
at 4 a.m., he breathed his
last. Bishop Taylor was with him
on Vivi hill, and nursed him; but
in vain.</p>

<p>Living and traveling at his own
expense, full of love to all men,
humble, studious and hardworking,
Christian Borella was cherished
wherever he went, his death and will be
lamented by many,in Africa as
well as in New-York.</p>

at Loanda, Sept. 30, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of instructions
no 7. stating that my report on direct steam
communication with W. Africa had been received
and copy transmitted to Postmaster General.</p>

<p>I have also received the circulars, dated
June, 20, 23, 26, 17, 25, July 1, 14, and 
duly noted contents. I will answer the
queries made in two of them, as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>During the portion of quarter ending this
day and beginning Sept 1., date of my assuming 
my duties, no American Vessels have
entered or left this port and no fees have
been received at this Consulate.</p>

<p>For the same period I enclose Forms
No. 25, 90, 103, 159, 117, 118, &amp; 119.</p>

<p>The balance of my account for salary

<pb facs="ViewScan_60002.jpg"/>

and contingent expenses is $82.91/100 for
which amount I have drawn on the Hon.
Secretary of the Treasury in favor of Messers.
Bywater, Tanqueray &amp; Phayre, 17 Broadway
New-York.</p>

<p>As the officials and people here constantly
conformed a Commercial Agent with a Consular
Agent, it will be well to have my title
changed to that of Consul as soon as possible.</p>

<p>From a letter of the Treasury Department
to Mr. Downing, it appears that he was allowed 
ninety days salary for period of 
transit. Based on this precedent, if correct,
I take the liberty to ask the Department,
if possible, to allow me my salary for the 
days (exceeding the fifty drawn drawn for) which
I necessarily spent on the way to this port.
I sailed from New York on July 1st, arrived 
in Loanda on Aug. 31 took charge on Sept
1, &amp; began services on Sept. 2, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of
your Circular dated July 17, 20, &amp; 27
whose intents were duly noted.</p>

<p>Enclosed I have the honor to transmit 
to the Department:</p>

<p>1) A Report of the present State and
needs of this Consulate</p>

<p>2) A Report on the present political
situation of Portugal and Angola.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Coml Agent</p>

<p>Enclosures:</p>

<p>1) Report on Present State of Consulate at
Loanda</p>

<p>2) Report on Present Political Condition of
Portugal and Angola, with annexed
printed documents</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60004.jpg"/>

<p>Report on present State
and Needs of U.S. Consulate at
St. Paul de Loanda</p>

<p>From the Inventory sent last march, The Department, 
could infer, to some extent, what this
Consulate has and what it lacks; but a detailed 
report on the present state and needs
of the Consulate is surely not out of place.</p>

<p>1) The Office</p>

<p>This used to be in Mr. Newton's office, in 
a corner partitioned off by a common wall about
8 feet high, and when I took charge, that corner
had been evacuated in favor of the British
Consul (newly appointed) and the U.S. archives
were piled up in Mr. Newton's business office.</p>

<p>As the Department probably known, Mr.
Newton has retired to Europe and his business
here is in charge of clerk. Mr. Ed Bannister 
is no longer connected with Mr. Newton's
firm. Whether the two consular archives, American
and British, and to be kept in the same room
or partition, I am not sure of, but think they
were.</p>

<p>Until a better place can be found, I
have hired two rooms as the American 
Mission, one for myself, the other for office</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60005.jpg"/>

<p>The latter is on the ground-floor, has a door
to the front of the house, and another door opening 
into the schoolroom which is only used on Sundays.
A partition wall reaching to the ceiling, separates
the office from the store-room of the mission.
My bed-room is up-stairs.</p>

<p>2) The furniture</p>

<p>As appears from the Inventory, nothing was 
turned over to me but the <unclear extent="one word"/> remains of
a few chairs, and two ruined book-cases, which
latter Mr. Bannister was not sure belonged to
the Consulate.</p>

<p>I furnished the office with some of my own,
and borrowed chairs, table, and repaired one
small book-case. To these I added a table
and book shelves, which I made myself
from old boxes. The walls I adorned with
African and other maps of my own, so
that the office, tho poorly furnished,
looks pretty decent and comfortable.
Considering, however, the rapidly growing 
importance of this port and the 
nation represented at this Consulate, its 
office should, in justice, be properly furnished. 
Furniture is very dear at Loanda;
so I propose to the Department to either
appropriate a sufficient seem to buy said

<pb facs="ViewScan_60006.jpg"/>

furniture here (counting the cost here to be
at least 100% more than it would be in the 
States) or to send a full supply of office 
furniture from the States.</p>

<p>If this Consulate be henceforth part in 
charge of decent men, and detailed inventories 
required of them, the Department may
be sure that the furniture will be properly
cared for.</p>

<p>3) Office paraphernalia</p>
 
<p>Of these nothing was turned over except what
is mentioned in the Inventory (Two stamps,
a few waifers, sheets of paper and envelopes).
The stamp mentioned as "hand stamp" bears
the inscription "Commercial Agency" and is
therefore no longer correct, nor is it in good condition. 
Letter-files needed.</p>

<p>Just now I have received from the Department 
a supply of forms and stationary, but 
no ink nor string. These I shall have to buy
The press, mentioned in former inventories,
has not been transferred and may have
disappeared in Judson's time. One ought
to be sent by first opportunity. As there is 
no bookbinder in this place, it would seem
advisable for the Department to send some
material wherewith the officer might find

<pb facs="ViewScan_60007.jpg"/>

himself what things require binding (and there
are some). Packing-paper, too, which, here, is
rather high, should be not but not with myself lot.</p>

<p>4) The Archives</p>

<p>a) Forms. Of these, more than
half were obsolete, but no mixed up, that 
it took me several days' hard work to
sort the antiquated from the good and
to sort and arrange the latter.</p>

<p>The result in that the Forms lacking, even 
after arrival of those sent with stationary to
me, are Nos:</p>

<p>b) Books. The list of those extant is found 
in the Inventory.</p>

<p>The set of books pertaining to the S. Thomé
Consulate is all blank. It might serve for 
a Consular Agency in that island when one
be established. That one will have to be established 
there is sure as soon as direct communication 
between W. Africa and the States 
be a fact. S. Thomé &amp; Principe are <unclear extent="one word"/>
for the production for coffee, cocoa and fine timber.
They also offer a good market for higher clan
goods, such as are produced by America.
An American firm beginning modestly, would 
do a good business</p>

<p>Of the Loanda Consulate book.</p>

<p>The Register of Landing Certificates is blank</p>

<p>The Marine Extended Protests has but one page filled 
by Judson</p>

<p>The Invoice Book has only two entries (1879 &amp; 1883)</p>

<p>The Seamen's Registrar was only used from (1881-1883)</p>

<p>The Passports used only since 1889</p>

<p>The Ship's Daily Journal has record from 1881-1891</p>

<p>The Marine Note of Protect has one entry by du Verge
&amp; one by Bannister</p>

<p>The American Seamen <unclear>Relieved</unclear> has entries from 1881-1884
&amp; one in 1889</p>

<p>The Treasury Fee Book regularly kept, by Newton's
firm, from 1881-1891</p>


<pb facs="ViewScan_60009.jpg"/>

<p>The Record-Book was used by Downing to copy some
extravagant letters to high personages, and since, by
Newton's clerks and Bannister to copy letters and
documents aside from Dispatches to Departments
There is nothing in it previous to Downing &amp; 1888.</p>

<p>The Letters Sent has a few entries in 1883, a few
in 1888 and regular ones since 1889</p>

<p>The Letters Received contains entries since end
of 1888</p>

<p>The Two old Despatch Books mentioned in Inventory
contain one; Archer Silva's &amp; Newton's despatches
between Oct. 1864 and March 1878, Jackson's 
from <unclear>later</unclear> date to April 1878, the Newton's
to March 1879.</p>

<p>The other: Newton's despatches from April
1879 to Dec. 1879 and after a gap 
of 3 years, those from June 1883 to
June 1885</p>

<p>In a third, unbound, volume are despatches
and letters from Sept. 1885 to Oct. 1887
The Despatch-Book proper contains despatches
and official letters from Jan. 1880 to June 1882 
(Newton) and from then to Jan. 1884 (Du
Verge). After gap, Downing's letters &amp;
copies of documents from Nov. 1887 to
March 1888. After another gap, Newton's
Inventory of things taken over by him

<pb facs="ViewScan_60010.jpg"/>

on Judson's death, and subsequent dispatches
and letters from <unclear>Nov.</unclear> 1888 to Bannister's correspondence
the whole of this and beginning of mine.</p>

<p>Record-Books Lacking:</p>

<p>A Letter Book, into which to copy official letters
apart from Despatches to U.S. Departments.</p>

<p>A Miscellaneous Record-book, though the
old one, mixed as its contents are, might
continue to be used for its proper purpose.</p>

<p>A Record of Commercial Returns</p>

<p>A Quarterly Account-Current Book</p>

<p>An Index-Book.</p>

<p>As may be inferred from the above, the
two latter Records were never kept, which 
made it next to impossible to find anything
dating book to a predecessor.</p>

<p>The Inventory tells what printed
books there are, and in what condition. from
it can be inferred what books may be
lacking</p>

<p>The Consular Reports were never taken
care of; so the collection is most important</p>

<p>c) Correspondence</p>

<p>This I found in utmost confusion except
the latest, sent to Bannister since he had 
sole charge.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to sort what

<pb facs="ViewScan_60011.jpg"/>

there is, and now all the letters are chronologically 
arranged in different packages, awaiting
binding.</p>

<p>The division is:</p>

<p>Package (1) Instruction from State Dept.
(incomplete but beginning with a few
addressed to Archer Silva)</p>

<p>(2) Circular from State Dept.
(same remarks)</p>

<p>(3) Letters from Treasury Dept.</p>

<p>(4) Official letters from other 
Consulates</p>

<p>(5) Official letters from Portuguese
authorities (such as on left)</p>

<p>(6) Letters and documents concerning
crews and ships</p>

<p>(7) Letters and documents concerning 
missions</p>

<p>(8) Judson's private letters &amp;
accounts (a most disreputable
bundle).</p>

<p>Excepting Newton's and Du Verge's, though
both incomplete, scarcely any correspondence
has escaped.</p>

<p>It is high time to bind what is left.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60012.jpg"/>

<p>5) Flagstaff and flags.</p>

<p>As stated in last mail, Newton's clerk
said they were not sure whether the flagstaff
belonged to Consulate or not. I showed
them since the letter of the Department
authorizing Mr. Newton to spend $25.-
on purchases and erection of one and they
said that did not prove that Mr. Newton
actually got the money, and that I should
get Mr. Bannister (now disconnected from
Newton, Carnegie's) to declare whether the
money was received or not. I have not
yet been able to find Mr. Bannister 
since that time, and so the matter is
standing, until I see Mr. Bannister,
when, no doubt, the matter will be satisfactorily 
decided.</p>

<p>Still, for either the removal and erection
of the old, or the purchase of a new staff, I beg
the Department to allow me to spend,
in first case not more than five dollars,
and in the latter case the maximum of
twenty five dollars.</p>

<p><del>Hitherto</del> Meanwhile, I have, on convenient occasions
hoisted the flag on the flagstaff of the 
Mission House where the Consular office is
temporarily located</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60013.jpg"/>

<p>As to the flags, the boat-flag, though some
what moth-eaten will yet do for the rare occasions
of this port; but the large flag, already
torn at the corners, needs being superseded
as fast as another box comes from the Department. 
It would be wise to send with 
the flag some tones of naphthalene to ward off
insects.</p>

<p>6) Consular Officers</p>

<p>The arranging of the consular correspondence 
and its <unclear extent="one word"/> have given me, together 
with what I gathered here from conversations, 
a very fair idea of the history and 
work of each successive consular officer.</p>

<p>The impression, that history leaves, is most painful 
for an America. Excepting Archer Silva,
who was the most popular and generous
trader Loanda had in this century, all the
Americans who have held this post were fit
for the penitentiary and the gallows rather
than for the office of representatives of the
United States. Of Jackson I know nothing
as he was here but as a passenger.</p>

<p>That the only one to maintain the dignity
of the office in all that line, should have
been an Englishman, Mr Newton, is rather
humiliating; and not less humiliating

<pb facs="ViewScan_60014.jpg"/>

is the fact that he used to give the American
Consulate openly or <unclear extent="one word"/> as part-salary to
one of his clerks.</p>

<p>Now, as Angola is being more and more 
occupied by American Missions, as its commercial importance 
is fast growing, and as there is no
doubt that are long it will form a powerful 
independent state with strong sympathies 
for the United States, it is of the 
highest importance, that, should I be replaced
from decision any other cause, the standard
of this Consulate, which I shall have raised
out of the mud, be never again lowered
by sending here men who are a disgrace
to their country and to mankind, even in darkest
Africa.</p>

<p>But this improvement in the personel
of the Consulate depends chiefly on the
Salary. While I, who have got a reputation 
as a philanthropic Diogenes, can
manage to live and do some good with my
salary, there is no doubt but that an
ordinary man, frequenting the society of the
other consuls and Consular agents can impossibly
get along with the salary of the post.
The price for a poorly furnished room
and board (two meals a day) at any one
of the two or three better hotels of the place is

<pb facs="ViewScan_60015.jpg"/>

2.75 per day, if taken by the week or month,
and the extras entailed by living in such a hotel
make the expense of an additional 50¢ to one dollar
per day necessary.</p>

<p>The only way for a Consul to keep out of debt
would be to accept a situation as clerk or to 
go into business with some capital. Thus the
Department in confronted with this dilemma; 
either have a trading Consul who will take care
not to have American competition in the Province
&amp; thus hinder rather than advance the commercial
interests he is supposed to promote, or have
a consul, who will give his time and talents
to the consular business, and pay him enough
to enable him to do so. Angola, with its 600,000
square miles of the best land in the world, and Loanda, 
whose custom house cleared last year, in
spite of all struggling 550,000$00, deserve something 
better than a last-class Consulate.</p>

<p>In a city like Loanda a salary of two 
thousand dollars should be the minimum for
a Consul for Schedule B.</p>

<p>P.S. I would also beg the Department to allow
me 5 milreis (=5$40) for subscription to the "Futuro d'Angola"
and the same for the "Mercantil" another leading papers of Loanda.</p>

<p>Report
on Present Political Situation
of Portugal &amp; Angola.</p>

<p>As promised in my first despatch
from Angola, I now lay before the Department a
detailed account of political movements within
my Consular District. And first of all, allow
me to state what I noticed on the way from
Lisbon to Loanda.</p>

<p>1) Voyage on S.S. Ambaca</p>

<p>We had on board over 300 Portuguese emigrants,
sent in Government expense to Portuguese West-Africa,
but chiefly to Angola. This was only the first batch 
of the crowd to follow on the by-weekly steamers
of the "Empreza Nacional". The lot of the "Ambaca"
hailed from OPorto and consisted of hungry workingmen 
all revolutionary Republicans, of whom the 
Portuguese Government was more or less afraid. As soon
as they were on board these men showed what could
be expected of them. The municipality of OPorto had 
promised all the residents of OPorto a present of
5 milreis = $5.40, but when the agent began to
distribute the money, on board the "Ambaca" and
returned to give that amount to those who were not
on his list of OPorto men, the whole crowd resolved
&amp; declared, they would not sail unless all got

<pb facs="ViewScan_60017.jpg"/>

the same amount. The minister of Marine ordered
to delay the departures of the ship, as company of <del>4</del>
Marines was sent on board and the steamer was
surrounded by tugs and launchers from the Marine
Arsenal. On the seventh however, the Government decided 
to give all men equally the 5 milreis and
the "Ambaca" was allowed to sail, after a new
company of marines had been put on board with
a lot of ammunition.</p>

<p>On the way out, however, it soon became evident
that the missions were worse than the emigrants
and during the whole voyage the steerage passengers
practically ruled the ship. Every time launches went
ashore with cargo those emigrants would simply 
find the ship's officers aside and jump into the
boats and have a jolly time ashore. If no <unclear extent="one word"/>
happened, it is due to the Captain and first class
passengers, who being all Republicans, let the 
poor fellows have their own way.</p>

<p>At Principe (Prince's Isld.), some of the
emigrants walked up to a plantation where one
of the exiled OPorts rebels is working and made 
him an <unclear extent="one word"/>. There, as at other places, when the
boats would bring the passengers back in the coming
a red flag would fly on the first launch &amp; the
crowd would sing the "Portugueza" the new
Portuguese <unclear extent="one Portuguese word"/> which the government

<pb facs="ViewScan_60018.jpg"/>

tried in vain to prohibit in Portugal. Before the ship
sailed from Principe, a big bon-fire was lit on the
hill where the exile's plantation <unclear>lais</unclear>, and the immigrants 
answered with land <unclear>"vivas"</unclear> for the exile,
pistol-shots and the singing of the Portugueza.</p>

<p>S. Thomé</p>

<p>Here the whole white population was highly
indignant against the Portuguese Government, and
had just held an excited meeting to protest
against following manners of the Government</p>

<p>1) The change in the export duties by which it
becomes almost impossible to export coffee and cocoa 
direct to foreign ports, and in the import
duties, which by forcing all foreign goods to pass
through the hands of Lisbon agents creates a
rise in the prices of next to all goods.</p>

<p>2) The premium granted to the Congo State
to contract (i.e to buy) 500 natives of Angola,
at a time when S. Thomé &amp; Principe cannot
get a sufficient number of (slave) laborers for
its coffee plantations.</p>

<p>3) The <unclear>Cession</unclear> (as it is called) of part of the
Lunda empire to the same Congo State.</p>

<p>The population of S. Thomé &amp; Principe whose 
black workers ar Angolans and whose white
population is intimately connected with that of
Angola is now one with the latter in the opinion

<pb facs="ViewScan_60019.jpg"/>

that the home government is the worst <unclear extent="one word"/> of the
colonies and that the time is come for the latter
to free themselves from the Lisbon magnates.</p>

<p>Kabinda</p>

<p>Here I saw no sign of political excitement,
but admired the magnificent barracks of the 
battalions statement here and the beautiful palace
of the governor. I talked with some of the soldiers
and found that most of them are from the District 
of Loanda; as for back to the interior as
Kasanji (600 miles), who were pressed into the
service. At Kabinda they take native women,
&amp; so the Kabinda race is being rapidly mixed
with the Angolan. Soon all the Kabinda women 
(who hitherto only <unclear extent="one word"/> Fiote or Kongo) will
know Kimbundu (or Angolan) which most men
already learnt is Loanda or other ports, and vice
versa a great number of Angolans are learning 
Kongo so that when the day of independence
comes, the people of Portuguese Kongo will feel
one with those of Angola, south of them. Unwittingly, 
the Portuguese Government is doing everything
to mould the greatest of modern black nations</p>

<p>Commercially, I noticed that the great Dutch
firm (Nieuwe Afrikaanse Handels vennootschap)
in building three new homes in Kabinda with
a view to transferring here the bulk of their

<pb facs="ViewScan_60020.jpg"/>

Banana business, and thus escape to some extent the
vexation taxation and regulation of the Kongo State</p>

<p>As the Portuguese steamers no longer call at
Banana and the Portuguese port at S. Antonio
has no great importance, I saw little of the state
of affairs on the Congo, and what I heard the
Department may know from its agent out there (?).</p>

<p>Ambiz</p>

<p>This place lives entirely from the coffee which
the<del>y</del> natives bring from the interior, and owes its
importance and prosperity to the fact that its tariff
is very moderate compared to that of Loanda.
I heard that Mr. Newton has obtained a concession
for a company to work again the old and rich
copper-mines of Bemba, back of Ambiz</p>

<p>Loanda.</p>

<p>Here I noticed immediately that a new
life has come into the old city and that it
will soon count among the great harbors of the
world. The change that has taken place in the
18 months of my absence is wonderful. Politically,
the spirit of independence has <unclear extent="one word"/> from the
natives to the whites and the question is solved
in the minds of the leading men. Be it sufficient
to state that the first thing, on meeting me
again, which the two first men of Loanda
(the first lawyer &amp; the director of the Bank) told

<pb facs="ViewScan_60021.jpg"/>

me in a whisper was: Things are in bad shape
in Portugal, are they not? The Republic and
the independence of this are not far. Both these
men have about 20 years residence in Loanda, &amp;
have made up their minds to finish their careers
in these parts. One of them is already limited as
is the future President.</p>

<p>Shortly before my arrival, all the leading traders
of Loanda, at the call of native leader, had held
a great indignation-masking and resolved to protest
against the cession of Loanda and the contracts
allowing the Congo State to buy 500 natives
of Angola. As I already wrote to the Department, 
they also effectually hindered the
purchase of any natives for Kongo State service,
and the agent of the Kongo State, after losing
his reason from the shock &amp; the abuse of morphine, 
had to return to the Kongo without having
obtained anything. It must also be noticed
that the people of Loanda solemnly declared,
and stick to it, that they maintain their rights
to the part of the Lunda country allowed to the
Kongo State, and they intend to enforce it as
soon as they see an opportunity.</p>

<p>Annexed to this are 1) The protest
of the capital (Loanda) against the two
contracts with the Congo State, in which

<pb facs="ViewScan_60022.jpg"/>

protest they declare that for them the Portuguese
parliament does not represent the nation, but is 
only a body of mercenaries, 2) The letter of 
thanks of the same meeting to Ex-Governor
Ferreira do Amaral for his speech against those
contracts with the Kongo-State 3) The protest
of the Commercial Association of Loanda, to which
all the leading firms belong.</p>

<p>These three documents have been largely signed 
by all the whites and natives who are not in the
employ of the government.</p>

<p>I have not the time to translate them; but as
the Department has a translator who knows Portuguese 
I advise that those important documents
the precursors of the declaration of independence
be translated by him and duly noticed</p>

<p>Gringo Andongo</p>

<p>I also enclose a no. of the "Futuro &amp; Angola"
containing an important article "Ao paiz" &amp;
the protest of the municipality of Pengo Andongo,
a large town some 300 miles in the interior. 
It is remarkable that the four of the 
five members of the municipal board are
natives and the fifth, the President, declares that
his wife and children being born Angolans, his
sympathies are with them. The protest of the
municipality though <unclear extent="one word"/> in the most rebellious

<pb facs="ViewScan_60023.jpg"/>

<unclear extent="one or two words"/> was signed by most of the whites of
Pengo Andongo. On sending the protest of the
Loanda papers for publication the president of
the municipality states that of the Governor
dissolve the municipality, all is ready to reelect
it.</p>

<p>Dondo</p>

<p>Not long ago,the exiled journalist João Chagas
(of the Oporto Rebellion) was invited to visit Dondo
(about 6000 population) &amp; get from the Governor
General the permission to go. On his arrival, the 
municipality went in a body to receive him at
the steamer; a grand reception was given him in
the town, Republican speeches were made and 
a street was given the name of João Chagas.
The Governor treatment to dissolve the municipality, 
but on learning that it was sure to be
re-elected, he contended himself with suspending
the government "Chefe" for not suppressing that
manifestation. As to João Chagas he was sent,
for punishment to the delicious climate of Mossamedes 
where he continues his propaganda.</p>

<p>Mossamedes</p>

<p>What happened or was going to happen here
is still somewhat mysterious; but one thing is
known, namely that a <unclear>sergeant</unclear> &amp; some of the
new immigrants had made a plot to seize <unclear>the</unclear>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60024.jpg"/>

<unclear extent="one word"/> Governor and make a revolution. One betrayed
his companions and these were shipped to Portuguese
Guinea.</p>

<p>The annual war with the natives in the interior
of Mossamedes, on the Kunene River has, it appears,
<unclear>turned</unclear> out a failure for the Portuguese, this year. After
an initial success in which more than 6000 heads
of cattle were <unclear extent="one word"/> from the natives, the Portuguese 
(black) troops have had to withdraw and
have arrived in Mossamedes in great disorder.
The Governor General has gone there by last steamer,
in order to investigate the two questions.</p>

<p>Sr. Dantes Baracho the delegate of the Portuguese
Government for the delimitation of the Lunda, who
has been here more than two months doing nothing
was also to go with the Governor but at last moment
a telegram came and he returned ashore 
with his baggage.</p>

<p>People here say that if the Delegate of the Congo
State comes, they will not let the two delegates
go to the interior.</p>

<p>The Spanish man of war "Isabel II"</p>

<p>Though less important, the following fact has its
significance. The "Isabel II" has been here for some
time, and for a few days, had the company of
an English flagship and of a German cruiser.
After the departure of the latter, the <unclear extent="one word"/> men

<pb facs="ViewScan_60025.jpg"/>

of Loanda gave a grand reception to the Spanish
officers, and, ironically, also invited the English.
The answer of them was that they had to sail next
morning early, and no they did. As to the Spaniards
and Portuguese, though they said it was no political
manifestation, they could not help letting it out
as the return <unclear extent="one world"/> offered on board by the Spaniards, 
when one of the officers forgot himself &amp;
added to his "vivas" for Portugal &amp; Spain, the contrary 
for England. The "Isabel II" sails to day
for the Cape.</p>

<p>Summing up, I wish to state that in
Portugal the general feeling is, that the independence 
of Angola is a thing to rejoice in
rather than anything else, provided the Portuguese 
element remains permanent, and educated
natives who speak &amp; write Portuguese an not yet
separated from the Portuguese shock, in the Portuguese
mind. So the Portuguese Government has a
twofold object in view, in sending out thousands
of immigrants to Angola: 1) to export the revolutionaries 
of the worst type, and thus to prevent
an immediate popular attack at home, 2)
to introduce so many Portuguese into Angola,
before, by independence, it opens with it doors
to all nations, and thus secure the predominance
of the Portuguese language and tradition as

<pb facs="ViewScan_60026.jpg"/>

in Brazil. As in all other things, honour, the
Portuguese Government goes against its own interests,
for it sends out men, and so few white women,
that these immigrants are going to raise a lot
of mulattoes who are more opposed to Portuguese
rule than the blacks.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand hectacres of the best land
on the high and healthy plateau of Caconda
and Bihe have been granted to a Portuguese
Company who is to establish there a colony
with the hundreds of <unclear>imports</unclear> <unclear extent="one word"/>
by the Government.</p>

<p>As to trade with the United States and
opportunities for American Capitalists to make
grand <unclear extent="one word"/> this is one of the most
promising fields. The people have feel
instinctively that for the building up of
a great nation in this land no nation
can be more helpful to them than our
United States who are the model and
ideal after which they are striving.</p>

at St. Paul de Loanda, 21 November, 1891</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>
To the Department of State.</p>

<p>Nomination of Vice-Commercial Agent<lb/>
Receipt of Exequatur</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents</p>

<note>No. 14</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
at St. Paul de Loanda November 21, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In accordance with your instruction
No. 3, of March 19, 1891, I have the honor
to submit to your approval my nomination
of Rev. Lancaster C. Burling, as Vice 
Commercial Agent, or as Vice-Consul, at 
this port.</p>

<p>The nominee is an American Citizen,
of age, an ordained minister of the M. 
E. Church of America and has been two
years at Loanda, as a missionary connected 
with Bishop W. Taylor's mission</p>

<p>These facts will, I hope, be considered
sufficient evidence that the candidate
is qualified for the office.</p>

<p>As the Portuguese authorities are so much
inclined to see political agents in all
foreign missionaries, I would have pre-

<pb facs="ViewScan_70006.jpg"/>

ferred a layman; but, there being no other
American available, I had no choice.</p>

<p>As for my reasons in not re-nominating
Mr. Bannister, the principal one is the 
violent hatred of the Portuguese for all 
Englishmen and all that is English, which
makes it unwise to have an Englishman
represent the United States. Then, according
to Regulations, an American, when equally 
qualified, is to be preferred to an alien.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/> 
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
at St. Paul de Loanda, Nov. 21, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Whereas we now have a U.S. Board
on Geographic Names, whose duty it is to simplify 
and rectify geographic nomenclature, both
for official and public use, and</p>

<p>Whereas the official name given in the U.S.
to this city and Consulate, St. Paul de Loanda,
is neither correct nor practical, and has 
been the cause of many petty annoyances,</p>

<p>I respectfully submit to the Department
for the consideration of afore-said Board,
and eventual action of Congress rectifying
the official name of this Consulate, the
following reasons for suggesting that 
St. Paul de Loanda be rectified to Loanda.</p>

<p>(1) The native name of this city was at
the time of conquest, and has been to this
day Luanda, in Portuguese spelling

<pb facs="ViewScan_70010.jpg"/>

Loanda, and pronounced by both natives and
Portuguese: Lwándá.</p>

<p>(2) Because the place was discovered by the
Portuguese on St. Paul's day (<unclear>1484</unclear>), they,
as was their custom, called it São Paulo de 
Loanda, that is St. Paul de Loanda.</p>

<p>The form San Paolo de Loanda, after seen
on charts and on letters, is half Spanish.</p>

<p>(3) And because the place was reconquered
from the Dutch on the day of the Virgin's
Assumption (1648) the name of Loanda
was enlarged to São Paulo de Assumpção
de Loanda, that is St. Paul of the
Assumption of Loanda</p>

<p>(4) These cumbersome and highsounding
names were, however, never used by the 
residents of Loanda, whether native or foreign; 
they stuck to the plain Loanda.</p>

<p>(5) The English, ever poor linguists, in
dealing with this name, made two blunders: 
1. On their charts, in their book, and
every where, they preferred to the popular
and plain, the long winded official, name.
2. Owing probably to a confusion of 
Loanda with Loango, north of the Kongo River,

<pb facs="ViewScan_70011.jpg"/>

they wrote and pronounced, instead of
Loanda, Loando.</p>

<p>(6) Now, as in conversation at least,
Englishman and Americans do not care 
for long names, many have taken 
the habit to shorten the name not
by dropping the merely historical St.
Paul and Assumption, but by leaving
our Loanda, and they call the city
St. Paul's. If the word is used
with English speaking people, the question
is which St. Paul's is meant, and
if used with any Portuguese or other
foreigner, no one recognizes Loanda
in that name. Hence misunderstandings,
losses of letters, and other little troubles.</p>

<p>(7) The Portuguese and Colonial governments; 
all the Portuguese and Angolan 
people; the English, German &amp; French
steam navigation companies, whose
steamers run to Loanda; the German,
English and other European mapmakers; 
in a word, all those who
have to do with, or know something
about, Loanda, have for several

<pb facs="ViewScan_70012.jpg"/>

years past, used this name exclusively
and the old erroneous St. Paul de
Loando, yea even the correct St. Paul
de Loanda, must be considered practically 
dead, or moribund.</p>

<p>(8) Therefore the U.S. Board on Geographic 
Names, and the U.S. Congress,
(as for as the title of this Consulate is
concerned) would confer a favor on
all concerned - Post-Offices, Schools,
Mariners, travelers, traders, geographers,
and on the U.S.'s representation at
this port - if they would give the 
venerable old term an official burial,
and give their official sanction to the
use of the genuine and modern,
though immemorial, name
Loanda.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda, Dec. 31, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Desiring to inform the Department of various
occurrences, each of which is not important enough
for a special Report, but may be of some use, especially 
to the editor of the Consular Reports, I
collect them all in one Despatch of Miscellaneous
News.</p>

<p>I. Rains, Sickness, Plenty, Lack of free labor and 
demand for unfree labor. After two years of drought,
the first rains (Sept. to Jan.) have been very copious
and this fact is attended by the three following consequences: (1) With the unusual dampness of the season,  
fevers and other tropical diseases have increased to an 
alarming extent. Nobody escapes the effects of the miasma;
one by one, all are laid on the sick-bed, some
to rise no more, the great majority, to ail on for
some time and then resume their normal state
and usual occupations. I have been suffering

<pb facs="ViewScan_70015.jpg"/>

these two months from a kind of rheumatism and
hand have had two review attacks of fever.</p>

<p>(2) With the drought, the dearth is coming to an 
end, and 1892 promises to be a your of plenty.
How great the dearth was, may be inferred from
the fact that large quantities of Brazilian manioc-meal ("farinha de pás") were imported into this land
of manioc and sold for about half the price of the
best native article, while foreign (American) corn,
rice and beans successfully competed with those
of the country. One good result of the dearth is that
the natives have learnt to eat bread, and having 
once acquired the habit, are not likely to give it
up with the return of cheap native produce. This enlarged
consumption of bread means an important increase 
in the importation of American flour.</p>

<p>(3) As soon as the showers soften the soil, the natives 
leave the exacting service of the whites and take
the cultivation of their own fields. This causes
a lack of carriers for the rubber and wax of the
far interior as well as for the coffee of the Cazengo
plantations and a general insufficiency of free
hired laborers for the railroad and all other
work depending on them. This shortening necessarily 
entails an increased demand for unfree,

<pb facs="ViewScan_70016.jpg"/>

or contract, labor. Within a short time, the prices of 
"servicaes" at Novo Redondo (Novo Redondo) and Benguella,
which are now the principal markets, have risen from 
40 to 70 milreis (one milreis = $1.09) per head, and the
prices may rise to double that amount before long.
The dealers say that the Congo State recruiting agent
offers them 750 milreis per man, and make this a 
plea for screwing up the prices of course the greater
the profits realized in the business the greater also the
activity developed in procuring the merchandise, that
is in "redeeming" slaves from the interior, which is 
simply a revised edition, of the old slave-traffic.</p>

<p>II Political News. The Congo State officer, Mons.
Braconnier, who has taken the place of the unfortunate
Vandevelde, as recruiting agent of 500 Angola
men for the Congo State army is still here at a hotel
waiting for the Portuguese residents to relax their 
opposition to this exportation of unfree labor. The
resistance of the colonists to the home government
in this matter has met with the approval of the whole
colonial and liberal press in Portugal. Some papers even 
go so far as to advise Angola to demand self government 
and prepare its independence. The prospect of 
bankruptcy in Portugal inclines the Portuguese residents 
in favor of the native ideal of independence.</p>

<p>Rather separation than shame is the motto of many.
Meanwhile, here as in Portugal, men of action are

<pb facs="ViewScan_70017.jpg"/>

not to be found.</p>

<p>Aided by friends and officials, the three principal
rebels of the late insurrection at Oporto, have managed
to escape from their exile. One went to Gaboon; the 
whereabouts of the two others is known only to the friends
who saw them off.</p>

<p>Senhor Dantas Baracho, the Portuguese Commissioner
for defining the Eastern boundary of Angola with the
Congo State has been here since August doing nothing but earn
his salary, the total of which is said to amount to
twelve Pounds (60 dollars) per day. Nor is there any
sign or probability of his going to his destination
before next May or June. As his salary is charged 
to the Provincial Treasury, the dissatisfaction of the
colonists may be imagined.</p>

<p>Every Portuguese packet continues to bring from
50-60 emigrants sent to the West-Coast by the
Portuguese Government in order to deplete the
prisons and get rid of dangerous and starving
tramps. While rational colonization would be 
a blessing to the Province and the home-country,
this kind of assisted emigration is a curse and
a source of endless troubles.</p>

<p>III New Line of Steamers. Nothing proves better
the immense resources and growing prosperity
of the Province then the rapid and steady development 
of steam navigation. While our

<pb facs="ViewScan_70018.jpg"/>

Philadelphia Board of Trade and enterprising men
of Baltimore and New York have talked for years
about a steam ship line to connect America with
Africa, and have not yet reached the point of sending
a trial steamer, the humble Jewish firm of Benchimol 
&amp; Sobrinho (Lisbon &amp; Loanda) has within
five months bought, repaired and run between Angola,
S. Thomé, Lisbon and Liverpool, four old English
steamers, a far trips of which will suffice to pay 
their cost. Without lowering the freight-charged
by the other company without Government aid, the enterprize 
has proved a grand success.</p>

<p>There is some talk of a third Portuguese Company
running steamers between the same ports.</p>

<p>IV - Vita case. About a year ago, a pupil of
the Baptist Mission at San Salvador (in the Congo
District of this Province) called Vita, accidentally
shot one his comrades. He was examined by the
Portuguese Resident (who knows neither English nor
the Kongo language) and sent, a prisoner, to 
Loanda, there to be judged by the competent authority.
As, after months of waiting, the missionaries 
heard nothing about the lad, two of them 
came at different times to Loanda to find out
his whereabouts and to have him bought to trial
Mr. Ed. Bannister (then acting British Consul)
did what he could for them, but in vain</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70019.jpg"/>

<p>Hearing of my arrival, the missionaries thought my
popularity might be more successful, and wrote to 
ask my intervention on the lad's behalf. I answered,
that, as the lad was a Portuguese subject I could
do nothing officially, but would use my private <unclear>influence</unclear>
in favor of their protégé. Not only was I immediately 
told where the prisoner was, and allowed to see him,
but the "Delegado" who was to judge the case, and
to whom I explained the particulars, released the
poor fellow with the statement that the papers 
concerning the case had disappeared. The young
man had been kept eight months in jail without
trial and (forgotten as his case was) might have
rotted away there, had not his missionary protection 
persevered to the end.</p>

<p>V Stars and Stripes in Congo State. On Dec. 8
Rev: J. Chester Hyde, of the American Baptist <unclear>Mission</unclear>
wrote to me as the nearest consul, since the <del>absence</del> death
of Lieut. Taunt, desiring some information on the
right of flying the Stars and Stripes in the Congo 
State.  "In Nov. (1891)" says <unclear>he</unclear> "Governor General
Wahis; returning from the interior, visited me, and
I flew the stars and stripes in his honor. The
next day the commissary of our district informed 
me that only consuls were allowed
to display their national colors beyond the
limits of Matadá and I was requested to comply

<pb facs="ViewScan_70020.jpg"/>

with the laws. Perhaps you may have some instructions 
concerning the stars and stripes. I answered
that (1) the Congo State is outside my consular sphere,
(2) but I would communicate the matter to you, and (3) 
in my private opinion the display of flags is a matter
of courtesy, not of right, but that if, in <unclear>identia</unclear>
circumstances, other nationalities were allowed to
display their colors, an American might expect the 
same privilege.</p>

<p>Complaints against over regulation and taxation,
and irksome red-tape in the Congo State are general
among traders and missionaries of all nationalities.</p>

<p>VI I have just seen, on his way home, Mr. Faulkner,
a Canadian missionary, who spent a few years in Katanga,
or Garenganze, as it is known through Fred.
A. Arnot's book. He told me how Mushiri, the 
King of Garnganze, was alarmed when he saw Mr.
Sharpe, the agent of the "British South Africa Company"
approach his capital from the East, "by the back door"
as he styled it, and how he absolutely rejected the 
proposed British Protectorate and bade Mr. Sharpe
leave his country at once, as soon as he heard that the
British wanted his copper mines. As is well known,
the Congo State has already conceded all those mines
and the whole of Mushiri's Kingdom to the Belgian
Katanga Company, though no Belgian had ever set
there a foot or got permission from Mushiri to exploit

<pb facs="ViewScan_70021.jpg"/>

his land and mines. Quite recently the Belgian
expedition of said Company and the Congo State
have been at Mushiri's capital and may have 
been more fortunate than Mr. Sharpe.</p>

<p>How to take oath for Form No. 101</p>

<p>(1) To the practice followed at this Consulate,
of having this oath administrated by Consul
to himself, simply witnessed by a <sic>responsable</sic>
person approved by the Department?</p>

<p>(2) The particular oath is understood
in American and required for Form No. 101
does not exist in Portuguese law, and nobody 
is authorized to administer it.</p>

<p>(3) A clear understanding between the 
U.S. government and Consuls in Portuguese
Possessions on this point is desirable.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70023.jpg"/>

<p>Dear Mr. Chatelain,</p>

<p>1- At one time it was the
custom to have one "Record of
Fees" form swore to before a 
"Tabelliãs" and signed by him
(gratis). I had so much trouble
in hunting one up at times
that I simply wore to the
Record before any responsible
person of good standing and
got his signature and no question
was ever raised. The Record has
to be sent in complete, Fees or
no Fees. The book is not signed.</p>

<p>2- I was not present when the
supply of stationary was opened
and as no list was forthcoming
I am ignorant of the contents
of the p'kge. I always used
any inkstand in the office
that i could lay my hands on.</p>

<p>I will make further enquires.</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>According to Par 503 Consular Regulations, 
the oath required for Form No. 101
is to be taken before a person having authority
to administer oaths</p>

<p>As appears from enclosed note of Mr.
Bannister and my remarks which follow,
the practice of this Consulate on this point
has not been according to the letter either
of Par. 503 or of Portuguese law. To settle
my scruples and those of any honest Consular 
officer in Portuguese Possessions this 
point ought to be definitely regulated by the
Department.</p>

<p>For my first oath to Form No. 101, I 
was governed by the practice of the Consulate.
Closer study and reflection made me doubt
its legality and I went for the second oath,

<pb facs="ViewScan_70025.jpg"/>

to a notary public, "tabelliãs". He refused
to administer the oath, stating that he was not
authorized to do so by law. In order to settle 
this point and find out whether any other 
functionary could perform that office, I called
on a Judge who knows English and is the 
highest authority in the Province on questions of
law, and I laid the question before him.
His answer was that the Portuguese law
recognizes only two kinds of oaths: (1) the 
oath of office of public functionaries, administered 
by a judge (2) the judicial oath, administered
by the judge in court. Any other oath is not
legal, and any functionary administering it 
makes himself liable to prosecution. The signed
declaration of a party is as binding as an oath could
be and the only thing a notary public can do
is to legalize the signature, thus preventing doubts
as to the genuineness of the signature.</p>

<p>Trusting the Department will either sanction 
the course hitherto pursued at this Consulate
or clearly state how that oath is to be taken 
in the future, I have the honor to be, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>

St Paul de Loanda, Febr. 13, 1892.</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Since New-Year the political condition
has remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Every by-weekly steamer continues to
bring some 20-50 tramps and criminals
sent by the Portuguese government to colonize
West Africa. Many die, a few manage
to go home at the expense of charitable people
or captains, the rest settles down to work, and
tries to make a living.</p>

<p>The telegraphic news, about middle of
January, of the change of Government in 
Portugal has quieted the spirits and given 
new hopes to the democratic patriots.
The present minister of Colonies, his secretary
and the secretary of the Minister of Foreign
affairs are almost Loanda-people, having
been here so long, and two of the being married

<pb facs="ViewScan_80001.jpg"/>

to white natives of this city.</p>

<p>In order to get over her financial crisis,
Portugal must find money somewhere, and 
the pawning or the selling of some of her Colonies 
is inevitable. I know from personal
friends in ruling circles from the conversation
of the people, and frequent hints of the press
of all colors, that while the sales of colonies 
to England, France or Germany would be strongly
objected to by the people, the pawning or sale 
of Macao, or the Azores, or the Cape-Verde
Islands or Kabinda (near mouth of Congo),
all strategic points of unsupposable importance 
for our navy and our commerce
of the future, to the United States, would 
be viewed with favor, yea hailed with joy,
by the majority of the people.</p>

<p>I can't help drawing again the attention
of the Department even at the risk of appearing 
impertinent, to this unique chance
of securing one, a few, or all of those
splendid ports.</p>

<p>Official relations between this Consulate

<p>Abstract of Contents.</p>

<p>(1) Though comprised within this Consular
district, the Province of S. Thomé has never
had any official relation with this Consulate.</p>

<p>(2) It seems desirable that, when appointed
the U.S. Consul at Loanda be also introduced, 
by the Portuguese Government to the
Governor of S. Thomé.</p>

<p>(3) For complete statistics and better 
reports, the Consulate ought to receive
the Official Bulleting of S. Thomé, as
it already receives that of Angola.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
at Loanda, March 25, 1892.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>The Islands of S. Thomé (St. Thomas)
and Principe (Prince's Isld.), comprised
within my consular district, form a separate
Province, with a Governor of its own, and with
an Official Bulletin, in which all official
communications and statistics of S. Thomé
are published.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the U.S. Consul at
Loanda, when appointed and approved, is
introduced by the Portuguese Government
to the Governor of Angola alone, and not to
that of S. Thomé, nor has the Official 
Bulletin of S. Thome ever been sent to
this Consulate.</p>

<p>As the Islands of S. Thomé and Principe
are by their large plantations of coffee,
cocoa and other tropical produce constantly

<pb facs="ViewScan_80004.jpg"/>

growing in commercial importance and promise
to have considerable trade relations with the
United States as soon as the means of
communications improve and the production
of either country be made known, it seems
desirable that the incumbent of this Consular
post be officially introduced, by the Portuguese
Government, to the Governor of S. Thomé, and
that the Official Bulletin of S. Thomé be
sent to this Consulate as that of Angola already 
is.</p>

<p>I therefore suggest to the Department
the advisability of requesting those two
favors of the Portuguese Government.</p>

<p>U.S. Consulate<lb/>
Loanda, April 13, 1892</p>

<p>F. O. St. Clair, Esquire<lb/> 
Chief of Conslar Bureau<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>On the receipt of your letter
dated February 16, 1892, I at once wrote to
the missionary in charge at Gaboon requesting
him to give me the information you desire
concerning the U.S property at that post.</p>

<p>Pending his answer, I hasten to give 
you what I already know on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham C. Campbell; whom
you mention as having the last, on June 30, 1886,
drawn for salary as U.S. Commercial Agent
at Gaboon, has been since then in the
States and is not expected to return to Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph H. Reading, who sent,

<pb facs="ViewScan_800008.jpg"/>

in February 1887, the last communication you
received from Gaboon, has also been in the
States, for some four years past, and will probably
stay there. He published in 1890 as Philadelphia
a description of the West-Coast entitled "The
Ogowe Band" and was then residing in a 
small town of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Through a Gaboon missionary who called
on me here about two months ago, I know that
at that time the U.S. Coat of Arms was still
hung out at the American Presbyterian Mission
House of Baraka near Libreville, the Capital 
of the "French Congo"; for this is now the official
native of the former Colony of Gaboon.</p>

<p>Probably all the Consular Archives are
there intact as left by Mr. Reading, the
mission station having been uninterruptedly
occupied since his departure.</p>

<p>It is well nigh decided that, owing 
to the prohibition to teach in any but the French
language, all the American Presbyterian
Mission Stations in French territory should

<pb facs="ViewScan_800009.jpg"/>

be passed over to the Paris Evangelical Missionary
Society who has a young work in that region.</p>

<p>The efforts of the American Presbyterian
Mission (North) will then be chiefly directed
to the southern and inland portion of the German
Protectorate of Kamerún, where there is greater 
liberty. The flourishing station of Corisco and
Benita will no doubt be kept up as long as 
Spain allows them to develop peacefully.</p>

<p>As to the expediency of continuing or
discontinuing that consular post, allow me to
suggest that unless they be disinterested
philanthropists, consular officers from America
at $1000.00, in a deadly climate like that
of Tropical Africa, will not in fact can not
be of a quality to honour their country or 
to give satisfaction to the Department of State.
They will never stay long enough in their districts 
to form an intelligent opinion of their
state and resources, or obtain reliable information 
of any sort.</p>

<p>In the present state of Africa, the Department 
of State need Consuls who are or
promise to become, authorities on African questions

<pb facs="ViewScan_800010.jpg"/>

whose word is of greater weight then the accounts
published in daily papers, who ar determined to
make a serious study of their districts, and who
are able to condense the results of their investigations
into readable reports. Such Americans cannot be expected
to spend or sacrifice their lives in tropical 
Africa for $1000.00 per annum.</p>

<p>Any one acquainted with modern Africa, who
peruse our Consular reports on this great Continent
South of the Sahara and north of the Cape, must be
struck with the sad inefficiency of our Consular
in that region, and must realize the need of a 
complete reorganization of that service if it is
do justice to the incalculable importance of that
immense region, not only to humanity at large but
directly to our United States not only morally,
commercially and industrially, but on the highest <unclear>sense</unclear>
politically.</p>

<p>Unless our Government's adhesion to the
Brussel's Act is to be an empty form, it behoves
the United State to be kept posted by its own agents
on the real state of slavery and slave-trade in
Africa and this cannot be without our Consular
system in said region entailing a new phase.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Having often had occasion to notice 
how little the Province of Angola is
known in Europe, and still less in America,
and realizing what benefits may result
to this Province and to commerce in general
if it be presented to the public in a 
condensed description, I have tried to 
fill the gap by giving in few words a
general idea of my Consular District.</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit to the
Department enclosed, a Report on the
subject. It is not the reproduction of
anything of the kind previously published
in any language, but the result of 
eight years' hard study on the ground.</p>

<p>As soon as possible, I intend to draw
a map of the Province, also entirely

the understanding of the Report, and which
I hope the Department will publish with
it.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Since my despatch No. 20, dated February
13, 1892, no material changes have taken place
in the political and commercial situation of this 
Province. Still some events may be of interest
to the Department.</p>

<p>Evasion of the Oports Rebels: Most of the
common soldiers who took part in the Oporto Rebellion
of January 31, 1891, and who had been exiled to
this Province and that of S. Thomé have been 
pardoned in the early part of this year and have
returned to Portugal. Of the chiefs of the rebellion
only one is still here, and for the simple reason
that he has no desire at all to leave Loanda.
All the other leaders of the Rebellion have contrived
to escape to France. One embarked at Mossamedes
on a sailing vessel bound for Gaboon and reached 
his destination without difficulty. The Director of

<pb facs="ViewScan_800016.jpg"/>

the Custom-House at Mossamedes was censured and
the "Official Bulletin" for conniving with the evasion,
but was not otherwise punished. Two other leading
rebels were at Loanda, put in boxes and embarked on French
steamer bound for the North. At Ambriz, however,
sea-sickness caused by the usual heavy rollers of
that coast compelled one of the secret passengers
to open the wicket of his box, and led to the discovery,
of the two fugitives. The captain of the steamer had 
them bound with chains and delivered them to the
Portuguese authorities of Ambriz. Here they were accompanied
to the fort by a detachment of soldiers and by a chasing
crowd who hailed in them the martyrs of the Republic.
After a few days of banqueting with their Republican
friends of Ambriz and receiving 300 dollars subscribed
in a few hours by all the leading traders, the rebels 
again escaped on a sailing-vessel bound for 
Gaboon, when they met their comrade from Mossamedes
and whence all embarked for France. After 
leading men of Ambriz were arrested and brought
to Loanda in a man of war; but as the whole population
of Ambriz had openly taken part in the envasion,
and the population of Loanda too was favoring
it, the men were again sent home unmolested.</p>

<p>A fourth leader of the Rebellion escaped in the same

<pb facs="ViewScan_800017.jpg"/>

manner - with the secret assistance of Republican Government 
officials from Principe (Prince's Island) and the accomplices were not more seriously
prosecuted.</p>

<p>Public feeling. The public opinion of Angola which for
a time leaned strongly towards separation from the metropolis,
ceased agitating this question, when the Dias Ferreira ministry
took the helm of government, because many hoped it would
by a coup d'etat establish the Republic. Then the tariff
question called public attention to another side, and now 
the presiding feeling is one of discouragement. "Everything
is lost; Portugal is dead" is now a frequent expression.</p>

<p>Commercial situation and the new tariff. The main provisions
of the new tariff are: (1) Most duties are charged according to the
weight of the merchandise (2) Portuguese goods are free or
well-nigh so (3) All foreign imports pay much higher duties,
(4) The duty in foreign alcohol is prohibition, (5) The Governor
has no longer the power to exempt any goods from paying
duties, (6) The Kongo District, which enjoyed free-trade
is now, by an agreement between Portugal and the Kongo
State, subjected to a tariff more moderate than that
of the Kongo State. This new tariff does not interfere
much with American imports: machines continue to be free;
kerosene and flour are necessities and Portugal can not
compete in them, and timber pays little more than previously
as to the general effect of the new tariff, everybody is now
agreed that it was a mistake, that its only result will
be a rise in the prices of all necessities and hence
of labor, and the final desertion of these markets by

<pb facs="ViewScan_800018.jpg"/>

the native trade of this far interior (rubber-trade)
which will prefer the Kongo-route. Of all events,
Angola which had enjoyed unusual prosperity during
the terrible crisis of Portugal is beginning to lose confidence 
since the new tariff has come; credit is being
withheld and the air is full of fears for the future</p>

<p>Railroad extension. On the 17th of May the fifth section of the Loanda
railroad was opened to the public. The daily up and 
down trains run now over 220 kilometres. The territories,
Cassoalala, is on the Lucalla river, near Dondo. The
coffee district of Cazengo, which is the main object of
the railroad, is not yet reached, but every new section
of 20 kilometres will already help the planters to bring
their coffee to the terminus of river navigation. The <unclear extent="one word"/>
rates are still too high to compete with the river boats
or to induce the native trader of the interior to make use 
of the railroad. Most of the Angolan natives, too, prefer to walk
over the track rather than pay the fare. The railroad
as far as opened, is still far from paying; but the Government 
guarantees the interest on all the capital actually
spent by the company on the road. This is the reason
why the company does not care to increase either the
passengers or the freight traffic; which could easily be 
done by a general reduction. Poorly built and managed
as this railroad is, it is a decided blessing to the country
and is sure to pay a good dividend when the coffee
region is fully tapped, that is in three to six years

<pb facs="ViewScan_800019.jpg"/>

The new trek of Boers. When, last year, the Boers of
Humpeta, in the district of Mossamedes, helped the
Portuguese government to subdue Bihe, they were so
pleased with that cool and salubrious high plateau
that they wrote to the Transvaal inviting their countrymen,
to come and join them. Now this new trek of Boers, estimated 
at about 200 waggons is daily expected in the south.
The Portuguese government has sent there the officer who
knows best how to deal with the Boers, having married
one of their daughters, and the people and government
hope he will be able to settle the new corners without
conflict. Hitherto the colony of Boers has been a State
within the State, jealously maintaining their own religion,
customs, administration, language and race. They elect their
own commandants, carefully and intermarriage with the Portuguese, 
and only go to war for the Portuguese government
when the latter agrees to pay them what they ask. Nor,
have they ever paid taxes. If, on the arrival of the new
trek, the Boers should decide to found a new Republic,
there is no military power in Angola that could prevent it;
and if the Portuguese government should try to subject the
Boers to the common administration, there is no doubt but
that it would hasten the formation of a Boer State.</p>

<p>It does not take a prophet to foresee the loss to Portugal
of the highlands of Bihe, Gangda and Ambuela, and
the formation in the near future of a State which European
statesmen never dreamt of, when they partitioned Africa.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800020.jpg"/>

<p>King Mushidi of Katanga shot. According to a letter
from Captain Stairs to a missionary in Bihe, King 
Mushidi of Katanga (Garenganze) was shot by an
officer of Stairs, as he was ordering his soldiers to
<del>make</del> fire on the approaching column of Stairs' expedition
I already informed the Department of how Mushidi <unclear>has</unclear>
coolly rejected the British Protectorate offered him by Mr.
Sharpe of the South Africa Company. It appears he was
going to do the same with the expedition of the Kongo
State; but the latter felt strong enough to fight, and
so made short work with the King's resistance. <unclear>Previous</unclear>
to Stairs' expedition, the King had kindly "received the
Kongo-State expedition under Lieut. Le Marinal, whom
I had the pleasure of meeting here in Loanda on his
way to Europe. Though Le Marinal, missionaries on 
the spot, and nation just come from there, I learn that
the country between Kasangi (Cassange) and <unclear extent="one word"/>
at the confluence of the Lulua and Kassai, is in a state of anarchy.
The Kongo State has destroyed the town of their <unclear extent="one word"/>
<unclear extent="one word"/>. Mukonga Kalamba, King of the Bashilange
and the Makioko slave-raiders are carrying as 
many human herds as they can manage, to be sold
as slaves to the middle men who bring the survivors
to the coast, where they are "redeemed" as contract
laborers.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt
of your instructions No. 12, dated
March 5, 1892, no. 13, dated April
6, 1892, and of your circulars dated
January 21, 30, February 2, 10, 15, 24,
26, and March 6, 9, 7, 19,16, which have had
due attention.</p>

<p>I also have to thank the Department 
for sending out new seals and 
furniture for the Consular office, which
have reached me in due course
of time. Unfortunately the panes
of the book-case were broken, one because
the weight of the glass had loosened
the wooden list holding it inside and which
was not sufficiently nailed, the other
because a board which had been nailed

<pb facs="ViewScan_800022.jpg"/>

inside got loose.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Governor General used
kindly to exempt Consular effects from
paying duty, but with the new tariff
he is no longer allowed to that, as
all the imports of the government are
now subjected to the common tariff.</p>

<p>Therefore the two last shipments above
mentioned had to be pay 20% ad
valorem, which however was not put 
too high.</p>

<p>Washington, D.C., April 15, 1892.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>At the request of several gentleman in the Consular service we
have recently examine with care the "Revised Tariff of Official
Fees" as prescribed by Section 508 of the Regulations of 1888, and
have reached the conclusion that several of the items therein specified 
are erroneously and illegally classed as "official fees." If we
are correct in our view of the law these fees are personal emoluments
of the Consul and need not be accounted for to the Government. Our
attention was first especially directed to the fee for administering
the oath to emigrants for the free admission of their animals,
vehicles, and personal effects (Form 93), under the Act of 1883,
(Par. 677), but in the examination of the question we found it necessary 
to consider the whole subject of official and unofficial fees,
and we soon became convinced that under the Regulations many fees 
were accounted for which in reality belonged to the officer.</p>

<p>We are preparing, in connection with the fir of which ex-Senator 
Omar D. Conger, of Michigan, is a member, to bring a series of
suits in the United States Courts to test these various questions, 
and would be glad to act for you. If you will authorize us so to do,
by signing the annexed letter of authority, which need not be 
acknowledged, we will examine your accounts in the Department and
advise you as to what particular fees we think we can recover for you.</p>

<p>We would also be glad to profit by any suggestions which you may
have to make as to the official or unofficial character of any of the
fees whih you are required by regulation or departmental custom
to account for.</p>

<p>We will not, in any event, use your case as a test one, and unless 
the Courts sustain our position, we will not even file your 
claim, but will return the power of attorney to you.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800024.jpg"/>

<p>We will undertake these cases upon a purely contingent fee and
will not call upon you for any contribution, even towards expenses.
In view of this we think a fee of 33 1/3 per cent. of the amount recovered 
would be reasonable.</p>

<p>It will give us pleasure, if you desire it, to furnish you with
special references as to our professional standing, etc., but refer
generally to the Columbia National Bank and the Washington Loan and
Trust Company.</p>

<p>Very respectfully,<lb/>
Jones &amp; Voorhees.</p>

<p>P.S. If the enclosed proposition is acceptable to you, please
your reply give us the dates of your consular service, continuous
or otherwise. We wold also esteem it a favor if you would give us
the name of your predecessor and his address, if known to you.</p>

<p>Equator, Congo State, April 27, 1892</p>

<p>There is an edict soon to be issued restraining all other 
than State flags except in neurtral waters. The Dutch,
French &amp; English flags are not allowed now inland
of Matadi and at stations on the Upper Kongo, except
when the State flag is given preference at the top.</p>

<p>Mr. Greshoff (of the great Dutch African Trading Company)
removes the Dutch and substitutes the State flag when
landing at the State quarters.</p>

<p>The French authorities interdict the use of the
State flag on steamers starting from the French side.
Even canoes without State flags cannot pass Equator
station &amp; a Dutch steamer was fired on for trying 
to thus pass Bangalla.</p>

<p>As for the Belgian flag, it accompanies the
State flag on the Upper Kongo steamers, but is not
allowed on Buildings of the Railroad above Matadi.</p>

<p>I may give you some of my observations during
a visit to recruit my heath to the furthest Baptist
Mission station Upoto and the head Congo Balolo Mission 
station Bonginda on the Lulanga river.</p>

<p>As to currency, cash money is beginning to be
introduced with the advance of the railroad to Palabala,
The State receives only money for stamps and prefers
money for taxes; and we must pay coast labor partly
in cash, which is only obtained as 6%, whereas

<pb facs="ViewScan_800027.jpg"/>

natives will pay in cash for goods and make
allowance for loss beside a fair percentage.</p>

<p>Cloth is in demand everywhere. Brass wire is
a convenient currency from Lukungu to as far as I
have gone. Cloth can be sold to advantages all 
the way especially on the tributaries.</p>

<p>Very small white and blue beads are in demand
on the Lulanga, and large Mayacca or
white beads, the size of ordinary marbles, are in 
great demand at Upoto.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that the State took off the
the tax on liquor with the 1st of January 1892, and
even with said tax gin in pint bottles was beginning 
to be the currency on the South as well
as the north bank of the Kongo.</p>

<p>Our postage is 50 centimes (10¢) per 15 grammes
(half <unclear>ounce</unclear>) for foreign and 25 centimes for domestic mail.</p>

<p>Ivory is especially sought on the Kassai and
rubber is bought in grant quantities at Luebo by
the Société Anonyme Belge.</p>

<p>Mr. Banks of this place has a beautiful and
substantial house of native woods, except the roof.
He makes tar for pressuring wood of gum copal <unclear extent="one word"/>
to liquid and thinned with palm-oil. When put on
hot, it renders the surface <unclear extent="one word"/> impervious to
water. He will make copal vanish when he
gets up linseed-oil. His roof is of European <unclear>boa</unclear>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800028.jpg"/>

covered with felt treated with this tar, and he
expects, by constantly covering the roof with the

<p>He has Medeira cherries, coffee, vegetable
<unclear extent="one word"/>, tomatoes, beans, lettuce, limes, <unclear extent="one word"/>,
malakajas, paw-paws, pine-apples.</p>

<p>His wife is well, and has born him two little
ones while living here. Thirty natives have put
on Christ and been baptized quite recently.
The language is Lu-nkundu, the people are
Ba-lols. Fish are plentiful in the river, hippos
abound. A leopard was scented, and a smaller
animal seen last evening. The leopard had killed
five people already. Mr. Banks killed one before.
Monkeys are numerous.</p>

<p>At Frebu, Rev. C.G. Hartsock, <unclear>A.</unclear>B. of Brown
University lives with his wife together with Rev.
Thos. Moody and wife of Rochester, N.Y. The 
former is building a house of brick.</p>

<p>It is rumored that Arabs are pouring in to the head
waters of the Lopori and the "Commissaire" of this
district is now visiting that country in a steam
<unclear>launch</unclear>.</p>

<p>At Bangala the State authorities have placed
260 liberated boys under Roman Catholic Fathers
to the trained for terms of 5 or 7 years in case of 
the smartest with he understanding that 1/10
of them are to continue in the mission and

<pb facs="ViewScan_800029.jpg"/>

9/10 are to enter the service of the State. They
sing the Magnificat in Latin and the Belgian
national anthem in French; ask grace after and
before meals in the same and show themselves off
in the alphabet fairly well. They also distinguish
"papa fume sa pipe" one letter from another in
concert. Their training is very fair.</p>

<p>The State is constructing excellent buildings of
brick with tile roofs. The hospital is especially
fine, and the physician is so successful as to keep 
it nearly empty, while the deaths are few.</p>

<p>The woods of this country are very superior, being
now used in preference to any sent out from Norway.
Yet on the lower river and in the cataract district
we are compelled to send to Europe.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>For the reasons enumerated below
I take the liberty to request the Department 
to grant me a furlough to
the United States, for the maximum
time allowable and to begin as soon 
as suitable to me in the early part
of 1893.</p>

<p>(1) Angola offers at the present time
one of the most promising fields for
American enterprise. Simple Consular
reports are not sufficient to induce American
capitalists to invest money in a country
so far and unknown. It requires personal 
conversation to inspire confidence in the
informant and to organize a commercial
undertaking. The first condition of important 
commercial relation between

<pb facs="ViewScan_800032.jpg"/>

America and Africa is the presence in
Africa of reliable American firms. When 
once set a-rolling the ball will soon 
become an avalanche. Mr. Hart, of the Geo.
Squire Mfctg. Co. Buffalo, N.Y., has
been here a few weeks, and has already from
the Loanda District alone, orders for more
than $20.000 of agricultural machinery and
the promise much more in the near
future. On similar and other lives, American
firms and individuals could do as well and
better, if well represented on the spot.</p>

<p>Two German commercial travelers who canvassed 
Angola a year ago got orders for
about $200,000 and since then German
imports are seriously competing with the
English.</p>

<p>(2) The Consular reports from this field
shall not suffer by my furlough, as
by correspondence with my friends here and
by the papers of the Province, I shall be
as well informed in America, and able
to supplement any information in greater

<pb facs="ViewScan_800033.jpg"/>

in connection with the Expedition, the publication
of my large work on Angolan ethnology, especially
on folk-lore, which is the most important contribution 
to that branch of science ever yet written,
and which is sure to give haste to the above-mentioned 
Congress, and various other scientific
meetings, associations and publications will be 
greatly benefited by my presence, even for a
short time, in America.</p>

<p>(4) Last, but not least, my physical constitution 
will, by that time need the bracing
influence of a more temperate climate, and
my heart and mind some heathenism and corruption of
all sorts.</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, June 29, 1892</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Six weeks ago a partner of Newton,
Carnegie &amp; Co. showed me in a clipping from 
an English paper a Washington telegram
purporting that Congress had for the current
fiscal year reduced the income of this
Consulate, as that of other minor ones in
Africa, to the fees.</p>

<p>At the same time I was advised 
not to be such a fool as to stay in Loanda
spending money for a government that ceased 
to support me.</p>

<p>There being a probability of retrenchment
in the budget of this Congress, I somewhat 
expected that my salary would be
stopped after the June quarter, and realizing
the impossibility of my continuing long to
be Consul without any support; was awaiting

<pb facs="ViewScan_90002.jpg"/>

the official announcement of the reduction, in
order to tender my resignation, and shut up
this Consular officer, for without remuneration
as English-speaking person would take it, 
as, however, the official advice of the curtailment 
has not yet come, nor do American
papers confirm that news, I have begun to
doubt its correctness.</p>

<p>Still, as this question has set me a-thinking,
I have come to the conclusion that,
whether the salary be continued or not, its 
would only be just, in presence of the peculiar 
circumstances of this port, of the Department
would assume the expense of office-rent,
not to exceed 7 dollars per month. This 
is the request I now respectfully submit
to your decision.</p>

<p>Considering further the fact, that I am
not engaged in business and give all my 
time to the collection and distribution of non-paying, 
yet highly useful, information on
this vast Consular district, an appropriate
increase of salary, which would per se settle
the office question, would appear yet more
just, and ensure the better standing of this
post.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>As illustrating the growing popularity 
of the idea of self-government
or complete independence, among
the whites as well as natives of Angola
and the echo the same idea is finding
in Portugal, I have the honor to 
enclose two extracts of Portuguese
papers on the subject.</p>

<p>Extract no. 1 is from the "Seculo",
by far the most popular paper of Portugal.</p>

<p>Extract no. 2 is from a new Angolan
paper, the "Commercio d' Angola",
founded by one of the oldest and
most influential white resident.
He is the father-in-law of a former
Governor and of six of the principal

<pb facs="ViewScan_90005.jpg"/>

public officers and merchants.
St. <unclear>Tarora</unclear>, referred to in Extract no. 2,
is a descendant of an old aristocratic family
and has been for about thirty years
an honored judge in the higher courts
of the different Portuguese colonies.</p>

<p>Extract no. 1
From the "Seculo" of Lisbon</p>

<p>Translation.</p>

<p>Independence of Angola.</p>

<p>The newspaper of the important
colony are again concerned about
the state of the Province and
the negligence with which it is
treated by the government of the
metropolis. One of them, thus
finishes an editorial on this
subject.</p>

<p>Let therefore, the unanimous
and arousing cry of all be
"the independence of Angola".
In another article, the following may be read:
"This cannot, nor shall it, continue. The
government is secretly selling the colonies
and we do not want to be English. Therefore,
the only alternative left us is to proclaim
the independence (autonomy) of the Province,
imploring the protection of the United States
of North-America. This, as is well known

<pb facs="ViewScan_90007.jpg"/>

would not be difficult; it will be done
the day we want it. It is, however,
to be lamented, that good and loyal Portuguese,
who long for the greatness of their country, and
love their native land, be forced by their 
ill-omened government to co-operate in
the disintegration of the fatherland."</p>

<p>In another article, mentioning an
injustice committed in S. Thomé, one
reads: "It becomes necessary for us
to change our minds, far from the present
regimen we can expect nothing but injustice
and contempt."</p>

<p>Thus it is that the government by
its favoritism and that of its delegates
is estranging the sympathies of the colonies
and pushing them to revolt.</p>

<p>When the thing is done, it will be too late
to repent.</p>

<p>Extract No. 2.
From the "Commercio d'Angola" no. 3.</p>

<p>Translation of marked Passage</p>

<p>"It is one more competent
&amp; authoritative voice, &amp; demonstrate
the lack of wisdom with which the
central government legislate, as a
rule, for the colonies, and to prove 
the absolute necessity of granting
to some of them their administrative
autonomy. . . . . . .</p>

<p>The idea of autonomy has acquired,
in these last times, a great prominence
in the minds of these who love their
country with genuine enthusiasm.
By granting autonomy to Angola,
Portugal would reap two enormous
advantages:</p>

<p>(1) The reduction of defecit in
the colonial budget</p>

<p>(2) The rapid increase of the
indirect receipts by the development
of commerce.</p>

<p>The Portuguese government has

<pb facs="ViewScan_90010.jpg"/>

already admitted the advisability of 
self-government, by turning our the administration
of certain parts of East-Africa to chartered
companies. But circumstances will force
it to carry out this principle more efficaciously, 
if it will not run the risk
of losing, sooner or later, its sovereignty."</p>

<p>P.S. The "Correro de Portugal" of Lisbon,
(devoted to colonial questions) thus begins its
editorial of July 6: "One of the gravest
symptoms is the cry of independence which
is being heard in almost all the colonies.
The Azores, Madeira, S. Thomé and An-
gola already openly raise the banner of
revolt and of annexation to the United States
of America; and in East-Africa, where the
Portuguese element is scanty; There is no
dislike of becoming part of the proposed
Federation of South-African States." And
the editorial, though lamenting the spirit
of disaffection towards Portugal goes
on to show that it is justified.</p>

<p>I may add that again and again whites and
natives say to me, or in my hearing: "Why don't
the United States try to get us?"</p>

<p>By suppressing my salary two months before

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p> In accordance with your telegraphic 
order "Close Consulate" of &#160; &#160;
I have closed the U.S. Commercial
Agency at Loanda and returned
to the United States.</p>

<p>The Governor General of Angola,
officially informed by me, announced
the closing of the Agency in the Official
Bulletin, previous to my sailing.</p>

<p>The furniture and archives of the
Agency I left in charge of Mr. L.
C. Burling of the American Methodist
Episcopal Mission at Loanda. This
mission is willing to buy the furniture
at a cheap rate, or to keep it in trust
until the consulate be re-opened.
The archives I have packed in various

<pb facs="ViewScan_90014.jpg"/>

boxes, ready for shipment, if the Department
should want them removed: The bound
books (Statutes, Commercial Relations, Consular
Reports etc) fill one large case. The Records 
are packed in a separate box; and so are
the unused Forms and the Manuscripts
(Instructions, Circulars and Correspondence),
with the seals.</p>

<p>As the archives do not contain any
document of real value, and as the Mission
is willing to store them for the government,
I would suggest to the Department to
lease them in their present condition
until the Consulate be re-opened.</p>

<p>Even after my exit of office and
return to the States, the Department will
always find me most willing to serve
the government with my experience and
knowledge of Angola and African
matters generally.</p>

<p>"Care of the Smithsonian Institution"
will always find me.</p>

at Loanda, Washington, Feb 10, 1893</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to inform you of
Mr. Ed. Bannister's irregular conduct in
various matters:</p>

<p>(1) In the settlement of Judson's estates
he kept some money (about $100.-) which
I already mentioned in a previous despatch,
and which I doubt he ever paid to the
Treasury; and he refused to return to me
some papers he had asked of me for said
settlement.</p>

<p>(2) Unbeknown to me he corresponded
as U.S. Vice-Consul with the Chicago Exhibition,
bought and sent to them a native canoe and
machila, telling the people at Loanda that
my appointment as Commercial Agent did
not interfere with his as Vice-Consul.</p>
 
<p>(3) I hear that since my departure

<pb facs="ViewScan_90020.jpg"/>

and the closing of the Consulate officially
made known in the government's Official 
Bulletin for Angola, he still claim to be
and signs himself as U.S. Vice-Consul.</p>

<p>(4) This is the more reprehensible as Mr.
Bannister is acting British Consul at
Loanda and appointed British Consul for
the Kongo Free State.</p>

<p>It might be well for the Department
to stop Mr. Bannister's unlawful use 
of said title by informing the public of
Angola through the Governor and the Official
Bulletin that Mr. Bannister has no
right to act as, or call himself, U.S.
Vice-Consul.</p>
