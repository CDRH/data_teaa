<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, September 14, 1892</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>
To the Department of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Salary for 1892-1893</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents</p>

<p>By suppressing my salary two months before 
I am acquainted with said suppression; by not providing
for my support during the interval, nor for my transit
home, nor for my release from my post, the
government forces upon me a loss of from $800
to $1000; while I have fulfilled my part of our contract.</p>

<p>The appropriation for Mozambique in continued by Congress.
I will not desert my post, but await a cablegram
from the Department, instructing me either to stay,
or to go home, or to close up, or appointing me to
Mozambique under certain conditions. Something should
be done to guard American interests in this Consular
district, and to prevent a crying injustice.</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Closing of Commercial Agency
and Return to United States</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents</p>

<p>The Commercial Agency is closed, as ordered
by the Department.</p>

<p>This fact is communicated to the Governor General 
who publishes it in the Official Bulletin,</p>

<p>The furniture is left in charge of the American 
Mission at Loanda, which is willing to
purchase, or store it.</p>

<p>The archives are packed away in boxes ready
for shipment or removal. They are not worth
paying freight on them.</p>

<p>Commercial Agency of the United States,<lb/>
at Loanda, Washington Febr. 10, 1893</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p> In accordance with your telegraphic 
order "Close Consulate" of &#160; &#160;
I have closed the U.S. Commercial
Agency at Loanda and returned
to the United States.</p>

<p>The Governor General of Angola,
officially informed by me, announced
the closing of the Agency in the Official
Bulletin, previous to my sailing.</p>

<p>The furniture and archives of the
Agency I left in charge of Mr. L.
C. Burling of the American Methodist
Episcopal Mission at Loanda. This
mission is willing to buy the furniture
at a cheap rate, or to keep it in trust
until the consulate be re-opened.
The archives I have packed in various

<pb facs="ViewScan_90014.jpg"/>

boxes, ready for shipment, if the Department
should want them removed: The bound
books (Statutes, Commercial Relations, Consular
Reports etc) fill one large case. The Records 
are packed in a separate box; and so are
the unused Forms and the Manuscripts
(Instructions, Circulars and Correspondence),
with the seals.</p>

<p>As the archives do not contain any
document of real value, and as the Mission
is willing to store them for the government,
I would suggest to the Department to
lease them in their present condition
until the Consulate be re-opened.</p>

<p>Even after my exit of office and
return to the States, the Department will
always find me most willing to serve
the government with my experience and
knowledge of Angola and African
matters generally.</p>

<p>"Care of the Smithsonian Institution"
will always find me.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Coml Agent</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>On my way hence I visited the U.S.

Statutes etc.<lb/>
A trunk containing old letters<lb/>

in fair condition.</p>

<p>The Records do not contain 
anything of importance.</p>

<p>If the Department decides to sell

<pb facs="ViewScan_90017.jpg"/>

the furniture, the American Mission at
Gaboon, which has hitherto taken care
of it, is disposed to buy it at a moderate
price.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Mr. Ed Bannister's irregular
Conduct</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90019.jpg"/>

<p>Commercial Agency of the United States,<lb/>
at Loanda, Washington, Feb 10, 1893</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I am sorry to have to inform you of
Mr. Ed. Bannister's irregular conduct in
various matters:</p>

<p>(1) In the settlement of Judson's estates
he kept some money (about $100.-) which
I already mentioned in a previous despatch,
and which I doubt he ever paid to the
Treasury; and he refused to return to me
some papers he had asked of me for said
settlement.</p>

<p>(2) Unbeknown to me he corresponded
as U.S. Vice-Consul with the Chicago Exhibition,
bought and sent to them a native canoe and
machila, telling the people at Loanda that
my appointment as Commercial Agent did
not interfere with his as Vice-Consul.</p>
 
<p>(3) I hear that since my departure

<pb facs="ViewScan_90020.jpg"/>

and the closing of the Consulate officially
made known in the government's Official 
Bulletin for Angola, he still claim to be
and signs himself as U.S. Vice-Consul.</p>

<p>(4) This is the more reprehensible as Mr.
Bannister is acting British Consul at
Loanda and appointed British Consul for
the Kongo Free State.</p>

<p>It might be well for the Department
to stop Mr. Bannister's unlawful use 
of said title by informing the public of
Angola through the Governor and the Official
Bulletin that Mr. Bannister has no
right to act as, or call himself, U.S.
Vice-Consul.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain</p>

<p>To Hon. Josiah Quincy<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Instruction no 19, of February 16, last,
by Hon. Wm. F. Wharton, informing me that
the property of the U.S. Commercial Agency
at Loanda Africa, "may remain, for the 
present, in the custody of Mr. L. C. Burling
of the M. E. Mission at Loanda" has in due
course of time reached me here.</p>

<p>For the guidance of the Department,
allow me to state that Mr. R. S. Newton,
formerly U.S. Vice-Consul at Loanda died at
Madeira on his way to England and that his
firm at Loanda is being dissolved.</p>

<p>Through no longer connected with the
department, I shall always be glad to

<pb facs="ViewScan_90022.jpg"/>

give the Consular Bureau any information
it may desire on African affairs, which
continue to be the special object of my 
studies.</p>

<p>The above address, or care of National
Museum Washington, will always find me.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Abolishment of Loanda
Consulate.</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.</p>

<p>Asking if Loanda Consulate
is abolished and with it the
Vice-Consulate, and if so
requests information as to

<pb facs="ViewScan_90024.jpg"/>

<p>Vice Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
 Loanda, March 29, 1893.</p>

<p>Honorable<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Some months ago a rumour got
about and came to my ears that the
U.S. Government had decided to abolish
the Loanda Consulate. This rumour
shortly took form in the departure of Mr
Chatelaine, Commercial Agent.</p>

<p>2. I have not as yet received any
others intimation as to the abolishment
of this Consulate, officially or otherwise.</p>

<p>My Commission from the United
States govt. as Vice-Consul is dated
July 17, 1890 and is endorsed with
my Exequatur from the King of
Portugal dated 16 Sept. 1891.</p>

<p>I had to give a Board for $2000
on my appointment, and I would
respectfully request you to inform
<catchwords>me</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90025.jpg"/>

me if my post as Vice-Consul
is abolished, and if so why my
Bond has not been returned to me.</p>

<p>If you cannot get more
courteous and suitable people
to represent you here than Mr. Chatelaine
it would be as well you should
keep this Consulate closed.</p>

<p>I am<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Ed Bannister<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul.</p>
