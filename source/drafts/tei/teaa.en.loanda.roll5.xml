<p>To Henry F. Downing, Esq.<lb/>
U.S. Consul,<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>In answer to your letter of the 9th
inst., with reference to your Consular drafts; the
reason we object to your drafts, is that we have
no business with America, and to send your
drafts to America, and pay commission for
collecting and remitting to England, costs
us a considerable amount, and such drafts
are of little use to us as a remittance in a 
commercial way.</p>

<p>If you could give us drafts on
England, we should be happy to take them
at par and think the Government will have
no difficulty in this, having agents in London.</p>
<lb/>
<p>We are dear Sir,<lb/>
Yours truly,
Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co.</p>

January 12th, 1888.</p>

<p>Hon G. L. Rives,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to submit
to the Department the following:</p>

<p>The desire of our people to 
extend their foreign trade is inducing
them to look towards this and adjoining 
parts of Africa as a possible field
for cultivation. If this is true, it is well
for them to know that, while it is by 
no means impossible for them to secure
a valuable market here, there are many
obstacles to overcome, the greatest of which
is inexperience but an examination
of the methods of other countries will
teach them much.</p>

<p>The commercial nations of 
Europe recognizing that the success
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0008.jpg"/>

of endeavor in these parts depended
upon a knowledge of its people, adopted
a system the wisdom of which is paved
by their large and successful dealings,
and, if our people act upon the belief
that they can conduct their enterprises
under different rules, they are making
a mistake which will cost them dear,
for costly experiment will only prove
the value of England's and Germany's
methods.</p>
 
<p>An internal knowledge of the
people, their wants and their habits in
a necessity. This is to be had only by
contact and American resident representatives 
of houses, learning the dialects &amp;c.
is of first importance; for often, the 
purchase of produce, does not so much
defend upon the quality of the goods,
as it does upon the repuration of the
trades.</p>

<p>As all or any of their habits
may be of value as guides to a study
of their character. I have taken this 
method of describing a few of those
<catchwords>customs</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0009.jpg"/>

customs which are more or less general.</p>

<p>That part of this country
which is on the coast line and between
Lat. 5º South, and Lat. 15º 20' South,
contains some twenty different tribes.
These again are divided and subdivided
and, while in some respects are alike, there
are many points of divergence.</p>

<p>When referring to the habits
and customs of these natives, attention
is drawn to the question of slavery; but
as practiced by them, it takes a complexion 
so mild that it carries with it
amongst them, no hardships. Their laws
make it a necessity for the owner to
give them every care, attend to them when
sick, feed and clothe them, bury and marry
them and happiness in every direction, and so
little difference is made, that the owners
in speaking of their slaves, call them,
"son or daughter."</p>

<p>The peaceful dispositions
of these coast tribes prevents war from
being a purveyor for the ranks of
<catchwords>slavery</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0010.jpg"/>

slavery, but these are found, through
the workings of their laws, which are
strict, a plentitude of victims. Offences
against property are causes for slavery or
death, any one caught stealing <unclear>becomes</unclear>,
be he who he may, chief or subject, the
property of the one stolen from the most
trivial things; for instance, spitting on
another's shoe, is looked upon as a heinous
crime deserving of death or slavery.</p>

<p>The source from which flows
the greatest supply is their superstitions.
Witchcraft is their only belief, and all
cases of accident or misfortune are
ascribed to it. Sickness, death, failure
of crops are all reasons for consultation
with a "fetish" man, who, selecting a
victim charges him with being the cause.
The accused, and often his family, are
either killed or sold into slavery, yet
they have the right to appeal to trial
by ordeal.</p>

<p>Trial with these people is
an ordeal by poison. This custom is 
not particular to Angola but, is 
<catchwords>common</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0011.jpg"/>

common to the whole West African
Coast; for I have seen the same superstition 
displayed with slight changes,
in Liberia and on the Gold Coast. As
the "modus operandi" of applying the
test may be found interesting, I will
attempt to describe it.</p>

<p>The poison used in this savage
performance is prepared by pulverizing its
powder the hard, thick bark of a tree
which the natives call <unclear>"sassi-wood"</unclear>,
the powder so made, is then dissolved
in hot water and is taken by the individual 
in small and frequent doses,
until it acts. It expresses itself either
as an emetic, meaning innocense, or
as a laxative, meaning guilt, or causes
<sic>causes</sic> a cessation of the pulsation
of the heart, and death.</p>

<p>The scene surrounding the
preparation of this poison, called "casca",
are horrid beyond the powers of description,
and, when seen by one, who in a sense,
is a descendant of these people such
thoughts spring to being as suggests grati-
<catchwords>tude</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0012.jpg"/>

tude for causes which have made me 
what I am.</p>

<p>The victim being found, the
act begins; "fetish"men and assistants,
with old and toothless hags adjourn
to the depths of the forest where in 
a place so formed by nature that its
echos will multiply their howlings,
they choose a spot and "fetish" it as suited
to their incantations. In a central position 
a mortar containing a pestle is
sunk into the ground. when the head
"fetish" man, mute and with stealthy
motions, take a position alongside the
mortar, with his assistants and the 
old hags forming, a circle around him
and thus, in immovable silence, they
remain until the gloom of night
descends to lend assistance to the
horrors of the scene. Then animation
takes the place of quiet and, the <unclear extent="one word"/>
of the forest is polluted by the <unclear extent="one word"/>
howlings of the savage crew, several
circles of fires spring to life, having
for a central figure the head <catchwords>"fetish"</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0013.jpg"/>

"fetish" man and the mortar, between
each of the fires are displayed their
grotesque idols "fetishes" and "charms," and
the making of "casca" is commenced.</p>

<p>The head "fetish" man putting
a piece of the bark in the mortar gives it
a blow with pestle. This example is
followed and repeated by his assistants
and the old women. As the night 
grows old action becomes more violent,
until the savages in drunken and
delirious frenzy discard their cloths and
brutal in their superstition, moisten the
fatal mixture with blood flowing from
self inflicted wounds.</p>

<p>Blood painted savages naked
in maddened, dance, amongst many
fires, whose lurid flames, accents
the forest's gloom where echoes, in answer
to the howlings of the yelling throng,
find fitting accompaniment in the
roaring of the beasts of the woods.
The flitting bat, and mournful
cry of the owl, with the moon
sending her light between the 
overhanging

<pb facs="ViewScan_0014.jpg"/>

overhanging branches of the trees,
to cast fantastic shadows over all
form a scene worthy of "Dante's Inferno."</p>

<p>The victim, in the meantime,
has been made the solitary occupant
of his hut where, during the long
hours of night, he has been forced
to listen to the scoldings and threatenings 
of the women of his town, who 
surround it. This is no light infliction 
for many of them have vivid
imaginations and are celebrated 
for their descriptions of the powers
of "fetish."</p>

<p>The hottest hour of the 
following day being the time appointed 
for the application of the
test, the subject is then taken to
a place which has been "prepared."
A path, fully exposed to the rays
of the sun, at both ends of which
are vessels containing "casca," and 
lined on both sides with natives,
young and old, male and female,
armed with all sorts of weapons <catchwords>is</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0015.jpg"/>

is a course on which he is to run
back and forth until the fetish,
which is given to him alternating at
each end of the course, works.</p>

<p>In running he has his 
advocate, who preceeds him with a 
bunch of palm leaves in his hand,
and encouraging him in these words,
"run, run, run, do not stumble, do not
fall, you are innocent and "fetish" can-
not catch you," at the same time he
is closely pursued by a native holding
a naked sword, who shouts "fetish"
pursues you, confess, confess, you are
guilty and must die." If in running
he should stumble or fall he is at
once and with great cruelty killed
by those that line the path, but
if enduring the fatigue, the poison
asserts itself as an emetic, he is
declared innocent. if as a laxitive,
guilty; and either dies or is sold into
slavery.</p>

<p>Every town has King
but he has very little power as it 
<catchwords>is</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0016.jpg"/>

is all in the hands of a council composed 
of the old men. The crown is
hereditary but because of the uncertainty 
of paternity, the natural
sequence of their understanding of the
laws of morality, it descends to the 
child of the sister of the King</p>

<p>When a civilized traveller
arrives at a native town he is received 
with ceremony and treated
kindly. Before entering a town he
advises its king of his desire to visit
him, and after receiving permission,
it is well for to forward
his compliments to King and council
by a bottle of rum, as well as by
sending a few glass beads to the
King's wives after entering the town
he is at once escorted to a large
enclosure when he finds the King
and all his subjects, salutes are
then given and returned, by clarifying
the hands in a peculiar manner,
followed by a welcome in words,
replied to in like manner by the
<catchwords>traveller,</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0017.jpg"/>

traveller, who, after making the
King a present or "dash" of cloth
and rum, is conducted to a hut
where he finds food and a bath
already prepared for him, as well
as one of the maidens of the town
to act as his handmaiden. When
the time arrives for the traveller to
take his departure another general
meeting and more presents the
King, in return receiving a sheep
or goat. Bidding farewell to 
to the King and council some of the
young men, warriors, conduct
him a short distance and then 
leave him free to pursue his journey.</p>

<p>There is no ceremony of
marriage except mutual consent.
The man has to make a large
present to his wife's family and
on the night when his wife is
delivered, give a "batuka" or dance.
If he fails to supply his wife,
who comes to him naked, with
clothing and house keeping ap-
<catchwords>pliances</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0018.jpg"/>

pliances, it becomes her right to
return to her fathers house.</p>

<p>Women give birth to children
with the greatest ease. At one time
I had occasion to want some rice
flour, I directed a woman to prepare 
it and after putting her to work,
went away, becoming occupied I
forgot it. After a few hours I was
reminded of the want and went
to find out what caused the delay.
I discovered the same woman singing,
and busily working at the mortar,
and when I asked why it was not
finished, received this reply; "Massa
I been go bush biffa make do some
ting", at the same time lifting
from the ground and showing me
a new born baby.</p>

<p>The methods of burial are 
more complicated. The body immediately 
after death is put into
a shallow hole which has been
dug in the floor of the hut in 
which it died. It is then covered
<catchwords>with</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0019.jpg"/>

with a thin layer of earth, even which
fires are kept burning until the body
becomes hardened. It is then taken 
out and stretched on a frame and
suspended over fires until it became
smoke dried, after which it is stood
in one of the corners of the hut,
where it remains, one of the family,
for years before final burial.</p>

<p>The belief of the natives in
"fetish" engenders a general fear of
one another, causing them to indulge
in many strange and amusing practices. 
Hospitality makes it necessary
that the guest be provided with "meal
and meat." This omitted offense is given
and an appeal is made to"fetish." It
sometimes happens that the unexpected
visitor finds the larder empty, but
the host, equal to the occasion,
sends and borrows a "lent rat,"
which is a common field rat which
has been roasted on a spit. The rat 
is then covered with a paste made
of <unclear>mandiocea</unclear> meal and handed
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0020.jpg"/>

to the guest, who, careful not to
touch the meat eats the meal. this
is continued until his hunger is
satisfied, when the rat is returned
to the owner. The guest has been
entertained with "meal and meat"
and the host is relived from any
fear of "fetish."</p>

<p>Time being of no value to
these people they will when seeking
a market for their products travel
miles for a difference of a few
beads or a yard of cloth, or to
find a trader known to them. I
remember when I was trading
in Liberia, that in barter for
a quantity of produce, I gave
with other goods, a lot of powder;
some two months afterwards the
native who had received these
goods returned, bringing with 
him all he had received, and
complained that one of the kegs
of powder was light in weight.
Examination showed that it

<pb facs="ViewScan_0021.jpg"/>

wanted about 1/2 of a pound, the
mistake corrected he went away
satisfied. so, to recover a value 
of about twenty cents, he, with
some twenty carriers, had spent 
at least six weeks on the road.</p>

<p>A peculiarity is their
dislike to trade with strangers.
They prefer to take less from
or be cheated by traders whom 
they know and who are familiar 
with their habits. This prejudice
is overcome only by contact
and learning their ways.</p>

<p>The customs and habits
as before described are more or
less common, to Angola and the
whole of the West Coast. There are
many more, local in their nature,
that, or which, may be subject
matter for future despatches.</p>

St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
January 31, 1888.</p>

<p>Hon G. L. Rives.<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform
the Department that my residence in
Loanda, 'tho short, has shown me that
it is impossible under present arrangement
for me to live upon the salary allowed
by the present laws. The frequent attention
of a physician and in many directions 
a departure from that strict economy
which might bring expenses within that
amount allowed is the effect of an
African climate. When to this is added
the expense of providing for a family
in the U.S., it will be seen that by
assuming this position at an early
date. I am not only just to myself
but am acting towards my government
<catchwords>with</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0024.jpg"/>

with frankness and with dependence
upon its justice.</p>

<p>The importance of this Consulate
is such as is derived from the cultivation
of African trade. Cape Coast <unclear>Castle</unclear>, daily
growing in importance, Lagos, Benny, at the
mouth of the Niger with many other points,
are valuable; but Monrovia, Gabon and
this place are politically and commercially 
the important points on this coast.</p>

<p>Those districts, which are
watered by the Congo and its affluents,
since the establishment of the "Congo Free
State" by Mr Stanley, under the protection
of the Belgian Government, have gained
a value in the age of the commercial
world second to no other part of the
coast. The effect of this has naturally
given to Loanda, because of its geographical 
position an impetus expressing
itself in many directions: for instance,
railroads, water works &amp;c.</p>

<p>Given these facts, it will be
conceded that, as a factor to advance
our foreign trade it is necessary that
<catchwords>it</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0025.jpg"/>

it should be cultivated in this direction.
While as a means towards this end a
Consulate here is of significance, the 
first consideration should be the Consul.</p>

<p>When the interests of our country
are placed in the hands of a trader, they
must suffer, more particularly in a district
such as this, where his whole duty is such
as relate to the advance of our foreign
trade.</p>

<p>A trading Consul not only is
at times prejudiced in judgement and
dependent in action, but he also often
finds occasion to make the performance
of public duty give way to private interests.</p>

<p>Induced by these opinions I 
have desired to keep myself in that 
position which would cause me to think
it my first and only duty, and enable me,
through influence and independence to
protect and advance the interests of
American trade and to protect American
citizens in their property, but I have
failed, and I find that unless
<catchwords>some</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0026.jpg"/>

some way is found for supplementing my
income. I cannot remain here.</p>

<p>This being the case I would
respectfully ask from the Department
its favorable decision in its consideration
of either of the following requests: Viz,</p>

<p>1º A recommendation to his Excellency the
President for my transfer to Liberia
as Consul General (see papers on file
in Dep't.),</p>

<p>2º Leave to visit the United States for
the purpose of forming such business
connections as will permit me to
remain in charge of this Consulate</p>

<p>3º Leave to return to the United 
State for the purpose of tendering
my resignation.</p>

<p>I regret that necessity
forces me into this position but I have
no option. It is better for me to "grasp
my nettle," than it is to seen the
risk of discrediting my government
as I am sorry to say, has here
and before by United States
Consuls here laboring under the <catchwords>same</catchwords>

<p>I have the honor to inform
the Department, that an expedition of
land and sea forces under the command
of Señor João Antonio de Brissac das 
Neves Ferreira Captain of the Frigate Gov.
of Congo; have taken military occupation
in the name of the King of Portugal
of a tract of land north of Loanda
and Ambriz, in the neighborhood of
parallel 7º S, and known as Ambrizette.</p>

<p>'Tho the strong natural
limit of Angola i.e., as regards climate
fauna and ethnology is from the Congo
River to Cape <unclear extent="one word"/>, yet the country occupied
by the Portuguese, until this later addition,
was only from Ambriz to Mossamedes.</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0030.jpg"/>

The natives inhabiting this
part of the coast are called "<unclear extent="one word"/>"
The natural effect of the slave trade was
to encourage them into indolence but
since all hope of it being again established 
has passed away, the development of
produce in this district and from the
interior has been great, and premises
to become much of greater and very important
in amount.</p>

<p>At present most of the 
produce comes from the interior. The system
of trade differs from that of other points
and is complicated and curious. All 
produce-except ivory are being brought
to the trader is weighed and price
<unclear>agued</unclear> in English "<unclear>longs</unclear>" in Portuguese
"<unclear>pecas</unclear>". This "<unclear>peca</unclear>" or "long" is the unit
of exchange to which all articles of
barter are refused: for instance, 3000
blue glass beads; 6 yds. common cotton
cloth: &amp;c. are equal to a "<unclear>long</unclear>" or "<unclear>peca</unclear>",
articles of greater value are more <unclear>longs</unclear>
each.</p>

<p>Being <unclear extent="one word"/> to allow
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0031.jpg"/>

the natives to enter the factories, the buyer
gives the seller a paper with the number of "<unclear>longs</unclear>"
or "<unclear>pecas</unclear>" written on it, which the holder
presents at a window of the store when he receives
its value in goods. It can be imagined what
shouting and noise there must be when hundreds
are gathered before one under each clamoring
to be paid first, but practice has enabled
the trader to become so expert in the handling of
these people that the chattering crowds seem
to melt away as by enchantment</p>

<p>The principal products are coffee,
pea nuts, fibre, sesumum seed, red gum copal
white angola gum, india rubber, palm kernals,
palm oil and ivory.</p>

<p>Several menial deposits
of more or less value, are known the
most important are, one of mineral pitch
and another of Malachite, but the natives,
through fear of annexation, have made 
these deposits "fetish," and as they are
reached via the beautiful Ambrizette
river, unfortunately navigable only by
canoes, the natives allow no white men
to go further towards its source than
<catchwords>a</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0032.jpg"/>

a few miles.</p>

<p>This expression of the policy of
the Portuguese is in accord with their many
efforts to promote the interests of the province,
giving them an added influence in the 
Congo and making Angola more interesting
to the commercial world.</p>

<p>The reports of the officer who
commanded in this expedition has not yet
been published but through the kindness
of the Governor General I have been able
to see the original of which the enclosed
is a translation.</p>

<p>Translation</p>

<p>The most Illustrious and Excellent Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to announce to your
Excellency, that in obedience to orders, I arrived
at this place on the 22d of the current month,
between the hours of 10 and 11 in the morning
and after seeing that the forces had their mid-day
meal. all other things being in readiness, I
gave the necessary order to disembark which operation
commenced at 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Knowing the harbor because of former visits,
I allowed the Bark "Cabinda" to near the shore, while,
the Steamer "<unclear extent="one word"/>" was 400.00 from the beach.
The Steamer "Massabe", having been ordered to 
follow in sailing order in the rear, did not
arrive until later when during the calm hours 
of night, she took the "Cabinda" in tow and moved
her seven miles to the point of <sic>disembaration</sic>.</p>

<p>Disembarking my forces, I sent in the
first boat the Resident with some workmen and
native servants with instructions to care for boats
as they arrived: Having done this I next sent ashore
by squadrons the 1st platoon of a Company of
infantry, giving ashore myself I caused the
troops to occupy, at quick step, a commanding
position on an elevation to the south of a village,
which rested on the edge of a swamp, and to
the rear of the English factory of Hatton &amp; <unclear>Cookson</unclear>.</p>

<p>The other platoon of infantry having landed
by squadrons, the artillery supplied with one 
section of camp equipments and baggage.
Thus disembarkation was compelled during the
<catchwords>night</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0034.jpg"/>

night and happily without loss, for in order to
prevent accidents I detailed a few sailors as a 
rescue corps and to assist in landing. Simultaneously
with the disembarking I directed the cantonment
of the troops and the posting of the necessary 
sentries for the night.</p>

<p>The following morning I planted a mast
brought from "Cabinda" for the purpose, then amidst
the sounds of trumpets; the beating of drums; the
military salutes of the of the infantry, the national salute
from the artillery and from the vessels of the fleet
<unclear extent="one word"/> in a holiday array of flags, I raised and
gave to the breeze the national emblem of our country,
and declared, in the presence of "Bocca de Rei" and
other native princes summoned by me to be present,
that I took possession of the country in the name
of Portugal's King; but that our intentions were
amicable and meant no wrong to them yet
a continuation of this kindness depended upon 
the future actions. Attempting to remonstrate,
they said that our flag could not be displayed
without the permission of their monarch for
reply, I told them, that I did not summon
them for the purpose of asking permission from
their King, but as witness to my act, and
that it mattered not whether permission was
given or not. These natives before taking their
departure mentioned a time for returning where
at a conference they would advise me as to
their King's decision. On the 26th they returned
and informed me that their King had decided
to accept what he could not prevent .</p>

<p>No disturbance has been caused business
having been carried on as usual at the factories
so that, I can report, without answering for
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0035.jpg"/>

the future, that now Ambrizette is occupied and
that the Portuguese flag is flying over the land.</p>

<p>God save your Excellency.</p>

St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
February 14th, 1888.</p>

<p>To the President,
Your Excellency:</p>

<p>Although it is the
good fortune of the negroes in the United
States to be brought under the influence
of a people whose example is leading
them towards higher levels, a knowledge
of the peculiar conditions which surrounds 
their history, prevents the supposition 
that it is possible for them, at 
this early date, to have reached that
situation where they can, as a rule,
be independent of pecuniary reasons
for endeavor.</p>

<p>This being allowed
it becomes easy for me, without prejudicing 
myself, to enter into a relation
of circumstances surrounding my present
situation, from which I desire to be
relieved.</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10005.jpg"/>

The public value which attaches 
to a Consulate is derived from many
sources, at some the duties are almost
only clerical, at others they become
judicial, at others diplomatic and,
so on until we touch that class
that find great, and important work in
laboring for the augmentation of our
foreign trade and this last mentioned
class is divided by the difference which
is between Consulates engaged in the enlargement 
of trade relations already
established and those whose duty it
is to open up new trade connections. The
opening up of new trade does not apply
only to those places where commerce 
already exists, but, also to those places
having a possible future commercial 
value.</p>

<p>That our growing industries
are finding new outlets in West Africa
the evidence of our exports, proves, but
these markets are open to improving cultivation 
and, under the case of Consuls
who are American Citizens, able, because
<catchwords>compensated,</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10006.jpg"/>

compensated, to confine themselves to
the performance of the duties of their
office, their value would soon be expressed 
in the most happy results.</p>

<p>Opposed to a Consul endangering 
his official usefulness and weakening
his influence or placing himself in a 
position preventing independent and 
unprejudiced action, by being engaged
in business, I took charge of this Consulate 
with the hope of being able to 
live upon my salary, but now after 
and in spite of every economy. I
find that it is impossible, and, unless
I can secure a larger income it will
be necessary for me to leave this service
of my country.</p>

<p>Recognizing an extended
field on this coast for the expressions
of such intelligent action as would
benefit our commercial interests, I
am anxious to remain. Familiar with
the commerce of my own country, its
industries and manufactures, I am
confident, if opportunity is given
<catchwords>me</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10007.jpg"/>

me to utilize the knowledge which
I have of Africa, its people and its 
trade, that I will be able to do
something towards, adding to our
foreign trade.</p>

<p>Because of the reasons as
before stated, I respectfully ask to
be transferred to Liberia as Consul
General, and I hope your Excellency,
that this request will meet with your
approbation and induce favorable
action in the premises.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>

May 16th, 1888</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the department
that Mr. Henry F Downing late U.S. Consul
at this place sailed for America on the
Portuguese mail steamer of March 15 on
thereabout and that I was appointed by
him to act as Vice Consul, my appointment 
dating from March 31st as will be 
seen by enclosed copy of letter to the
governor general of the Province of Angola
(Enclosure No 1)</p>

<p>The above mentioned enclosure 
was duly presented to the governor 
and received the proper official
recognition from him, and I assumed
the duties on the same date mentioned
in said copy of enclosure.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing carried the official
stamp and seal of the Consulate to
Cabinda the place where I was then
residing and delivered them to one
on the 18th day of March, but I could not
enter upon my duties before the day
specified in my letter of appointment.
<catchwords>Mr.</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10013.jpg"/>

Mr. Downing requested me to execute
a bond in the sum of $2000.00 (two
thousand dollars) which bond he returned
to me from St. Thomé with enclosed letter,
(Enclosure No. 2) upon finding it improperly
made out.</p>

<p>The general behavior Mr.
Downing during his short stay here was neither
commendable to himself nor creditable to
the government of the U.S. I am also
very sorry to say that his conduct here as
U.S. Consul was left if anything but
long and pleasant for his successors</p>

<p>1st.</p>

<p>He took all kinds of advantages of the 
confidence not to say ignorance of the Portuguese
here, such for instance, as paying his bills
with bogus drafts headed "U.S. Consulate"
which gave his victims the impression that
what said drafts possessed national value
with our government. Some of <unclear>two</unclear> drafts
or one of them at least has given for more
than $700.(seven hundred dollars)</p>

<p>Upon my arrival at Loanda I
<catchwords>found</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10014.jpg"/>

found:</p>

<p>That Mr. Downings creditors had signed
everything belonging to the Consulate.</p>

<p>I at once complained to the governor
generate who informed me that he would
take no action in the matter as Mr. Downings
victims had been led to believe the U.S.
government was responsible for Mr. Downings
debts.</p>

<p>The governor general advised me to
pay off the endebtedness, recover the Archives
and other effects, and report the entire 
affairs in detail to my government.</p>

<p>This I could not do and I had not
enough money, but I concluded to recover
the Archives, and leave the flags writing
material and other paraphernalia until
I could get instructions from the department.</p>

<p>It cost me 136 mil reis or $147.68
one hundred forty seven dollars and 68/100) to
recover the Archives, the receipt of which
I forward a certified translation
(Enclosure No. 3) I think that

<pb facs="ViewScan_10015.jpg"/>

that</p>

<p>Mr. Downing took away with him
the Consular regulation and most of
the despatches received during his incumbency 
of this office, as they cannot be
found.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have no forms
nor instructions of any kind by which
to be governed <del>by,</del>, not even precedents, as
the Archives have been loosely kept and
but very few things recorded.</p>

<p>There is no office furniture
belonging to this consulate, not even a
receptacle for the Archives.</p>

<p>I have found it necessary
to draw on the Treasurer for $50.00 in 
favor of Mr. John Hass Lisbon, which
I hope will be allowed, as I cannot
live at this place without money and it required
the greater joint of what I brought here
with me, to recover the archives.</p>

<p>I beg of leave to say
that if there in any irregularity the peculiarity 
of the situation here must
explain it away, as I cannot do things
of this nature <catchwords>properly</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10016.jpg"/>

properly</p>

<p>Unless I have the necessary
instructions and I would like to say further 
that if the department sees fit to
appoint me here as Vice Consul and
will furnish the proper instruction etc.
I will endeavor to do my duly not
as much promptitude and regularity as
my ability will permit.</p>

<p>I would be glad to have information
as to affairs rent furniture, etc.
as the expense for these things cannot
possibly come out of $1000 per annum
and furnish a man to live here, even
half way respectable.</p>

<p>It is thought here <del>that</del> that the
smallness of the salary is the reason
that the U.S. Consul sent here generally
resort to financial tricking and intrigue
and almost invariably leave in disgrace</p>

<p>Not understanding anything
about making drafts on the department
and having no resource from which to
learn &amp; have placed the above named
drafts to miscellaneous expenses, there
may be no such expenses. I 
<catchwords>beg</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10017.jpg"/>

beg</p>

<p>that the department will regulate
this properly for me so that there will
be no inconvenience attached to the
matter, because should there be <unclear extent="one word"/>
as to its immediate payment it will have
an injurious effect upon the next attempt I
may make in disposing of <sic>of</sic> a draft</p>

since my incumbency more all of

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform
the department that on my departure 
from my Consular district to visit the
United States on leave, because of the
absence of Vice Consul Newton at Madeira.
I was forced to entrust Mr Julius L. Judson
with the property of the United States
in any charge and he trusting that 
my recommendation for his appointment
as Acting U.S. Vice Consul would be
favorably acted upon is now performing 
the duties of the office and when 
so instructed will forward to the
department his bond.</p>

<p>Mr Judson is a citizen of the
United States, a graduate of one of our
colleges and a man of intelligence and
<sic>proberty</sic> and is worthy if the favorable
consideration of the department.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>

16th June 1888</p>

<p>The Honorable<lb/>
G. L. Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have to inform the department
that as Mr Henry F. Downing failed
record his official correspondence
in the despatch book I am unable 
to number my dispatches and I
consequently leave them un-numbered
until the numbering is correctly
adjusted by the department.</p>

<p>Since the receipt of the Consular
regulations from the department, I
have learned that the Consulate is,
with the exception of the archives
(an inventory of which I forward
here with) wholly without the proper
legal belongings of the office</p>

<p>As I informed the department in 
my communication of the 15th ultimo
all belongings of this Consulate were
seized by Mr Henry F. Downings
creditors, between the 15th and 30th of 
last March, while he was in transit 
to America, and before I assumed
the duties of the office.</p>

<p>After presenting my credentials to
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10031.jpg"/>

the Governor General of the province
I requests his interference in 
relation to the delivery of the 
Consular effects into my hands, and
his advice to me was to the effect
that I should pay the indebtedness
and take charge, as he had no grounds 
for interference considering the fact
that Mr Downing had led his creditors
to believe that the United States were
responsible for his debts and doings
out here.</p>

<p>Having no other alternative I
went so far as to redeem the
archives, as the whole affair was
being very disgracefully talked about
and knowing also that the state
archives were not for the hands
and eyes for the outside world.
For the redemption of the archives
I paid one hundred and forty seven
dollars and sixty eight cents $147.68.</p>

<p>I have here at present one
discharged seaman in the hospital
and one deserter also besides another
deserter whom I will send to the
Cape Verde Islands by this mail.</p>

<p>I have also ordered for the
Consulate four (4) chairs, one ordinary
table, one large receptacle for archives
to protect them from insects which
are very destructive here until the
department furnishes something
better. I have also ordered a 
<catchwords>flag staff</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10032.jpg"/>

flag staff to be erected, the cost
of which is 116 mil reis or 
$125.28. I have an old flag of
my own which I will use until
the department furnishes me with
another more appropriate.</p>

<p>The department will please also
furnish me with stationary and
office furniture, as it cannot be
purchased here, as cheaply as in
the United States, transportation
and all considered.</p>

<p>I desire to have a boat
also, if the department will be
good enough to supply one, as it
costs over $1.50 for the hire of 
a boat every time I visit a ship.</p>

<p>I drew on the treasury in last
month for $50 a draft in favor
of John Hass but not having any
regulations I find it was improperly
made out but from the nature of 
the circumstances I cannot but
hope that it was honored never-the-less.</p>

<p>I have the honor<lb/>
to be Sir<lb/>

<p>Hon G. L. Rives<lb/>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of department's
despatch dated June 15th as well as a 
printed paper, "instructions to 
Consular Officers on leave."</p>

<p>Referring to said despatch,
I would report that I left my
Consular district on the 5th of
April, 1888. As regards the terms
of agreement between Mr. Judson
and myself, they are in effect, to
allow me to draw all that may
be due the Consulate until such
time as I may return to my post,
for this Mr. Judson has already received
an equivalent. The rules contained
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20004.jpg"/>

in above mentioned instructions to 
Consular Officers on leave, have, today,
for the first time come under my
notice. Therefore, having no knowledge 
of any rule which made it necessary to have
a written agreement, to be furnished in
duplicate. I have failed unfortunately, to
provide one and am force to ask the Department 
to accept my statement as a fact.</p>

<p>I, having received no intimation
from the Department, that it had acted
favorably on my recommendation of
Mr. Baines as Vice Consul, although his
Bond was forwarded at the same time
as my despatch recommending his appointment.
I thought it advisable to not
leave Mr Baines in charge, and await
an expression from the Department
relative to his appointment as permanent 
Vice Consul.</p>

<p>U.S. Consulate<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda<lb/>
Washington, June 28, 1888</p>

<p>Hon. G. L. Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Referring to certain changes
contained in despatch of Acting Vice
Consul Julius L. Judson of St. Paul
de Loanda dated May 16, 1888, I have 
the honor to inform the Department,
that leaving Loanda on the 17th of
March I arrived at Cabinda on the
19th of the same month where I found
Mr. Judson and delivered to him the
Consular Seal and Stamp with instructions 
to proceed immediately to
Loanda, but not to assume the duties
of his office until the 31st, when 
I would be leaving St. Thomé, the
Northern limit of the Consular district
which place I desired to visit for
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20006.jpg"/>

the purpose of gathering information
which might be of commercial value.</p>

<p>It is true that I returned to 
Mr Judson his bond. My motive for
doing this was not so much that it
was not properly made out, but
that, having no knowledge of the 
sureties named in the instrument,
I was not satisfied as to their responsibility, 
and I judged that by 
making it necessary for him to 
provide another, he would be forced 
to have it certified to by some of
the Portuguese authorities and thereby
give reason to believe in its value.</p>

<p>Against the charges as to my 
general behavior while in Loanda, I
do not know how to defend myself,
unless they are specified, but will 
say, that wherein any action of more
as U.S. Consul at Loand, has been
subject matter for criticism, i have
to learn.</p>

<p>1st So far from being able
to take advantage of the "confidence
<catchwords>not</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20007.jpg"/>

not to say ignorance of the
Portuguese" for instance, by "paying
my bills with bogus drafts." I found
it impossible to get them to accept
good, honest government drafts, for,
with one exception, viz. Messrs Newton
Carnegie &amp; Co. There was no house
doing business in Loanda that
would handle an U.S. Consular
draft of any kind, and furthermore,
If Mr Judsons statements are to
be considered, value should be given
to that part of his despatch which
I here quote, "It is thought here
that the smallness of the salary,
is the reason that U.S. Consuls
sent here generally resort to financial 
treachery and intrigue and 
almost invariably leave in disgrace."
If this has been the experience of 
the Portuguese in Loanda with U.S. 
Consuls it is would seem that
they must be fond of having
their confidence and ignorance
again and again taken advantage
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20008.jpg"/>

of.</p>

<p>To my knowledge there has
been no business done by me with
paper, except with the well informed
houses of Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co. and
Baines, Lauer &amp; Co. and neither of
these houses are Portugese.</p>

<p>Referring to the statement
that on his arrival at Loanda, he
found that my creditors had seized
every thing belonging to the Consulate
I would respectfully inform the Department 
that in accordance with
arrangement entered into between
me, Baines Lauer &amp; Co. and my creditors,
Messrs Baines, Lauer &amp; Co. relieved
me from all other creditors but themselves, 
by taking upon their house
my debts and the seizure, I think,
will resolve itself in a matter of
an owner taking possession of 
what he was authorized by me 
to take. This is explained as follows:
I had certain furniture from
a dealer, for household use, for
<catchwords>which</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20009.jpg"/>

which I was to pay 40 mil
reis per month. To protect himself, 
Mr Quadra, the owner just
before my departure furnished 
me with an <unclear>inreceipted</unclear> bill of
sale and requested me to attach
a note to same stating in set
terms that the property was his,
and that he was authorized
to remove some at such time
as best suited his convenience.
This I did, and I suppose that
Mr Quadra acted upon his rights.
Mr Judson was cognizant of
this arrangement for he, with
me, called upon Mr Quadra and 
arranged with this dealer to carry
the contract over, on the same
terms. Mr Judson at the same 
time called with me on the owner 
of the house where was located
the Consular office, and contracted
to continue my lease. Therefore,
that this property was taken away
may be true, but, that the property
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20010.jpg"/>

of the United States was seized
I fancy a statement that should be
viewed with suspicion, particularly
that part which refers to the action
of his Excellency the Governor General, 
i.e., in refusing to take cognizance
of the matter. From my knowledge
of this Portuguese gentleman, I think
that he is too careful and well 
informed an official to subject
himself to reprimand or recall,
by encouraging an infraction
of the Treaty between the U.S. and
Portugal. Furthermore, how could
my "victims" be led to believe
that the U.S. Government would
be any more responsible for my
debts of Consuls who preceeded
me. If this view of the case is
accepted, it will seem that 
the payment of my debts, means the
purchase of household furniture
by Mr. Judson, for his personal use.</p>

<p>I would respectfully
<catchwords>inform</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20011.jpg"/>

inform the Department that
one copy of Consular Instructions
of 1881 as well as all correspondence
properly docketed and filed away,
as well as furniture somewhat in
excess of what is allowed is or 
should be at the office of the
Consulate.</p>

<p>Referring again to Mr
Judsons statement, that he has
no Consular Instruction no forms,
no products or anything I would
say that Mr. Judson was a guest
at my home there fore quite
two weeks when I tried to educate
him into the duties of the office,
and it seems quite a coincidence,
that he could so happily name
the right acct, "miscellaneous
expenses." for his draft in favor
of Mr Hass of Lisbon.</p>

<p>Mr Edmond A. Baines
may not be in Loanda, but he 
is then in Cabinda where Mr 
Judson resided, but, Mr Baines
<catchwords>should</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20012.jpg"/>

should be in Loanda no later than 
August.</p>

<p>In connection with the
above, I would respectfully submit
the enclosed letter from Mr Judson
to me which I find, bears the same
date as his despatch to the Department.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of the Rev.
Mr. Judson, from others, that can 
reflect unfavorably, upon his
character, I have confined myself
to facts.</p>

June 30, 1888</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
G. L. Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I beg leave to make the following
statement to the department viz
I have been for several weeks very sick
with rheumatic fever, have had the doctor 
nearly every day for the past three weeks.
Most of the returns and Consular Correspondence 
for this quarter I have had to arrange
while in bed suffering most excruciating
pains, and only getting a little help occasionally 
when visited by an English friend
Mr. Downing's disgraceful career here has also
rendered it very hard here for me as I can
find no one here willing to honor a draft
on the U.S. government. I have consequently
exhausted all the means I brought to Loanda and
have drawn on all the ready money I had in
Cabinda to meet the expenses of this quarter, to say 
nothing of my own doctors bill and medicine.
The disorder from which I am suffering is very
prevalent here and seems to beyond the power
of the Portuguese doctors.</p>

<p>I have the honor also to beg the department to
excuse this paper and that upon which most
of my returns are made as it was impossible to
procure other of the proper page. All the Consular
visiting material being still in the hands of Mr.
Downing's creditors. I promise the department
<catchwords>that</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20014.jpg"/> 

that 
as soon as I am furnished with proper forms and
instructions I will endeavor to render my accounts
as neatly and as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>I note the Governor General a second time concerning 
the Consular effects held by Mr. Downing's
creditors referring him to the treaty between the U.S.
and Portugal, he immediately advised me to <unclear extent="one word"/>
legal proceedings in the local courts for their recovery.
This will of course entail expenses which 
have no authority to make, which expenses may 
amount to several times the value of the 
effects in question, please advise me as to this.</p>

<p>Mr. Downing carried with him
all the forms for making out drafts except two
or three which he had partially spoiled.
Consequently two of mine made out on unofficial
paper as I could do no better notwithstanding
this, I hope you will honor or pay them, if you
dont, and force me to wait until I can get
forms, etc. I will starve here in Loanda.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton the English Vice Consul and former
U.S. Vice Consul returned here a few days since from
Madeira where he has gone for his health and to meet
his wife upon his ascertaining that Mr. Downing had
also defrauded him off a large amount, he told me
that he intended to let the next Consul sent here
starve as they would all have done had he not
cared for them</p>

<p>I write this <del>by</del> in bed on board the Portuguese
mail steamer on route for Cabinda where I will remain
three or four days to see if I shall not get better.
Of course I would not dare forward the department
such a mutilated dispatch under ordinary circumstances
but I have not walked in a month. begging your leniency</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge

<p>I would respectfully advise
that deprived of opportunity, because of
distance to secure information, I have no
connections to make as to statement of 
facts as therein mentioned, but I
regret that it was not in the power
of the Department to assume the position 
it now takes before I had now further

in a precurring way. Since my arrival

and paid $170.00. acct. salary, also

This latter draft I am able to and will
withdraw. Referring to other drafts
drawn by me I understand that
with the exception of two, they have 
all been paid. These two that were

<unclear>Kopf</unclear> &amp; Co. of New York and Joseph Taylor

their face value. This relieves the
Department from the necessity of 
considering them.</p>

<p>In recommending the 
removal of Robt. L. Newton Esq. as
U.S. Consul at St. Paul de Loanda
I had in view only the performance
of my duty as an U.S. Consul i.e. as
far as it touched the cultivation of
our foreign trade. A vast market teeming
with fast developing riches offering
prizes to commercial enterprise, I
<catchwords>found</catchwords>

found, on my arrival at Loanda,
monopolized by European nations. I 
saw with envious jealousy the vessels
of England, Germany, Holland and 
other European countries emptying that
fertile land of its products and their
citizens growing wealthy through
well directed efforts of their Consuls,
not the least active of whom was
H. B. M's Consul Robt. L. Newton Esq.
knowing that at one time America
had been building up a trade there
growing in importance every day but
had now died. I believed it would 
be wise to find the reason for its
decline. On examination I found
that the withdrawing of American
bottoms from the African trade during
our domestic troubles while interrupting
did not destroy our commercial prestige
in that direction for our exports to 
Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cape 
Town are still making gratifing
advance yet Angola, a province
written the valuable district of 
the

<pb facs="ViewScan_20025.jpg"/>

the Congo with its principal city 
Loanda had been gradually
eliminated from a condition of usefulness 
to our industries until now
commercial intercourse is nil and
the situation is such as allows the
mercantile house of Newton, Carnegie
&amp; Co. to inform the Department through
me that there is no paying <unclear>inducements</unclear>
for the introduction of American goods
there, and this in the face of the fact
that England finds there a growing
and paying market for, not only
her wares, but can dispose of in large
quantities, of petroleum originally
bought from us. Correspondence with
other and disinterested merchants advised
me that only a want of knowledge
of American products prevented their use
I therefore had reason to think that
the competition between nations, which
is finding an opportunity to express
itself so positively in Africa, hindered
a Commercial Agent of the most, aggressive, 
commercially, nation of the
<catchwords>world.</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20026.jpg"/>

world. England from during justice to
the needs of our revising commerce. For
this, with other reasons I recommended the
removal of Mr. R. S. Newton.</p>

<p>When I nominated Mr Baines
I did not know that it was his intention
to be for any time absent from Loanda
Pecuniary embarrassments everyday growing
more serious and prohibiting further residence
made my departure from Loanda <unclear extent="one word"/>
and, acting upon leave as granted by 
the Department, I took such steps in
the absence of Mr. Baines as would. I 
thought: be approved by the Department
and without prejudice to Mr. Baine's
appointment requested the Governor of
the Province to recognize Mr Judson as
Act'g U.S. V. Consul.</p>

<p>Mr Judson's capacity was
beyond dispute and as an ordained
minister of the gospel enjoying the confidence 
of Bishop Taylor and as an
American citizen he was envisioned by
such qualities as naturally earned for
him my confidence, causing me without
<catchwords>hesitation</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20027.jpg"/>

hesitation, to entrust him with the temporary 
change of the Consulate. That he has 
used the powers entrusted with him in a 
wrong manner is to be deplored but, at
the same time, I think that I should 
be relieved from my blame except
such as may attach to an allowable 
mistake.</p>

<p>In justice to myself I must
call attention to the fact that Mr Judson
had no right or, recognizable right, 
to admit that the U.S. Government was
responsible for my private debts &amp; by the
payment of my debts recover Govmt
property. There was a proper remedy
which if applied would have cost
the Government or the Consulate nothing.</p>

<p>I have no thought or desire
to think responsibility for this man's
actions but I regret that earlier knowledge 
in the premises was not mine, for 
then I would not have taken up 
my part of my pay and thereby
would have been much less in debt
to the government.</p>

<p><catchwords>What</catchwords>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>It is my painful duty to have to report to the
Department the death of Vice Consul Judson, who died 
here suddenly on the 8th inst. It would appear that
Mr. Judson went to the government office to get a
passport to go to Cabinda, and was seized with a fit
on the stairs. He was immediately put into a maxilla
and sent to his house which was close by. Dr. Oliveira
was called, and did all he could for him, but he died
almost before the medicine could be had from the Chemist.
Enclosed you will find certificate of death.</p>

<p>Immediately I heard of the occurrence, I went
to the Secretary who is at present acting Governor,
and requested him to allow me to take charge, and
as my appointment as Vice Consul for the United
States has not been officially advised to the Portuguese
Government as having been annulled, he said
he would not interfere. I therefore took charge of the

funeral, inviting only the Consuls of the different Four

following morning at 7 oclok in the English Cemetery

<p>I have taken full charge of all his effects, and of the

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda<lb/>
15 November 1888</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to report for the information of the
Department, that on the 31st October, the first
section, consisting of 45 kilometers, of the Royal
Trans African Railway from Loanda to Ambaca, was 
opened to the public. The inauguration ceremony
was gone through in the presence of the whole of the
commercial community and great numbers of the
native population the religious portion blessing the
engine &amp;c, being undertaken by the Vicar General, in
the absence of the Bishop. After the religious part of
the ceremony was concluded, the directing Engineer
and representative of the company, Major Folque of
the Engineers, spoke on the previous attempts made
to establish a Railway system in the same direction,
of the many difficulties they had had to encounter
(and which they had succeeded in surmounting)
in their endeavours to carry the project to a 
practical commencement; eulogising the enterprise
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<fw type="address">To The Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington D.C.</fw>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20033.jpg"/>

and energy of the Portuguese nation in the
development of her colonies, especially in Africa,
and claiming for this undertaking the making of 
a new era in the prosperity of this large province
of Angola, and in the civilisation of the African
race generally.</p>

<p>The line passes through districts alternating
between large tracts of prairie, wooded hills, and
fertile valleys watered by rivers and streams.
The country about the margins of these rivers is
already cultivated both by natives and Europeans,
and produces fruit in abundance, vegetables,
sweet potatoes, and large quantities of sugar cane.
With the facilities now offered by the Railway for
the carriage of machinery and materials for 
building purposes there is every prospect in the
near future of the large tracts of uncultivated
land being made to yield their quota of agricultural
produce.</p>

<p>There are proofs at hand of the utilizing of
this enterprise to the commercial community
generally, and to the agriculturist in the interior.</p>

<p>Large quantities of coffee are stored in the
district of Cazengo, owing to the want of carriers.
Thus the produce is tied up to the serious loss of
<catchwords>both</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20034.jpg"/>

both agriculturists and merchants here. The
coffee market in Europe is much better now than
it has been for several months, but the merchants
here are simply debarred from taking advantage 
of it, as they cannot get the coffee off the plantation
and in the meantime they not only lose a good
market, but interest is running on the Capital
so locked up. If the Railway were completed
to this district, all such risks would be
completely done away with.</p>

<p>If now that they have commenced, they will
go ahead and carry the line to completion as quickly
as possible, the prosperity of the province would be
assured. They have however, a rather difficult
country to go through before they reach Ambaca,
and there is not much prospect of the line being
completed within three years.</p>

<p>A train runs from Loanda daily over
the open sections, and the natives are already
beginning to make use of it</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Loanda, December 5, 1888.</p>

<p>Honorable G. L. Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to 
acknowledge the receipt of two
despatches from the Department
Nos 19, 20, and dated October 2,
the former requesting me to resume
my duties as Vice Consul of the 
United States at this port in
accordance with my appointment
dated October 17, 1868, which
I have much pleasure in doing,
and as I did as in the interest of
the government on the 8th of
November after Mr. Judson's
death, as already advised to the
Department, I shall date my 
resumption of duties from that
day.</p>

<p><catchwords>With</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30002.jpg"/>

With reference to Despatch No 20
I am unable to give a satisfactory
solution, Mr. Judson having died
as stated on the 8th November, and
on taking charge I found all-
Consular affairs in the utmost 
confusion. I found copies of
some letters to the Department &amp;c
on loose sheets of paper, but nothing
has been copied into any Book
since Mr. Downing left, and I can 
find no copies of Accounts of any
kind, or anything that will enable
me to clear up the items you refer
to. There is a pencil note referring
to a Flag staff, and a large stand
for Archives, which do not exist. As
for a Flag staff I know personally
that such a thing was never erected
on the dwelling occupied by Mr.
Downing and subsequently by Mr.
Judson.</p>

<p>I forward to the Department a
complete inventory of what I consider
as belonging to the Consulate and
<catchwords>which</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30003.jpg"/>

which I have removed to my office
and put into as good order as possible.</p>

<p>No Official paper nor Flag exist,
and I am afraid I shall find myself
short of many useful forms. Everything 
I found in the greatest disorder,
many forms being entirely spoilt by
want of care, and others eaten but
white ants and other insects that 
destroy such things in this climate.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Downing nor Mr. 
Judson have kept up the credit of
the nation they had the honor to
represent, the former having done
all he could to damage the credit
of any future Consul who may be
appointed to Loanda, as no one here
will now take a draft drawn by
an American Consul.</p>

<p>The Draft drawn by Mr. Downing
on the Department in favor of Messrs:
Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co for $244. 12/100
and now in the hands of F. A. Silva
of Charlestown, and which has 
not been paid, was cashed by
<catchwords>my</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30004.jpg"/>

my firm out of pity as Mr. Downing
had no money to pay for board
and lodging and would have been
obliged to leave the hotel, and
it secures to me unfair that a 
Draft for the same amount and 
bearing the same date in favor
of Mr. McDonald should have 
been preferred and paid. The
other draft for $262.50/100 which has
been paid, was cashed to allow
him to pay for hire of furniture
House Rent and Doctor's Bill to
enable him to leave this place,
but I since find he has paid some
of these debts.</p>

<p>With reference to Mr. Baines,
his nomination would have been
of non-effect as he has since become
bankrupt and has left the country.</p>

<p>When Mr. Downing came here
from Liverpool he drew on my firm
a Draft for his passage money £35
without any advice, and without 
any knowledge of or acquaintance
<catchwords>with</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30005.jpg"/>

with my firm, or my firm <unclear extent="one word"/>
which shows he had us conscience
where money was concerned.</p>

<p>In your despatch to Mr. Judson
also dated October 2, you say
Mr. Downing states he had a 
verbal argument with him to
draw the salary having given
Judson an equivalent. This I
believe was not the case, as I
was led to understand that Mr.
Judson paid him a certain amount
for the right to draw the salary.</p>

<p>I also know that Mr. Downing
tried to make similar arrangements
with another party here best did
not succeed.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Judson he has 
never been well received by
the Portuguese. He was fond of
low company, wining after with
the lower classes and convicts and
drinking with them.</p>

<p>Here $151.28/100 for Furniture and
Flag staff I have already explained
<catchwords>that</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30006.jpg"/>

that wove of these articles exist.</p>

<p>Item. $147.68/100. I have seen
Mr. Quadrio who seized the archives
and who says Mr. Judson promised
to pay him but never did so, so I 
cannot see that his Draft is justifiable.</p>

<p>Item. $158 48/100 For relief of destitute
seamen. I can give no explanation 
of this as I can find no document 
relating to it. I only know that 
he had one or two sick sailors in
charge for some time</p>

<p>With reference to the Despatch
to Mr. Judson relative to the seaman
John Hass I can give no explanation
as I see nothing in the archives
referring to it.</p>

<p>I have notified to the acting
Governor General my resumption
of the duties of the Consulate, who
in his reply expresses his great
satisfaction that the Consulate of 
the United States of America will
resume its regular functions in the
hands of one who knows how to
<catchwords>maintain</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_30007.jpg"/>

maintain the dignity of the country
he represents.</p>

<p>As I have no record of prior
dispatches of Mr. Judson's I cannot
follow on his numbers, I commenced
therefore on November 15, last,
at No. 1</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit
to the Department the Inventory
of the private effects of the lake Mr
Judson which I value at about
$100.00/100 to $120.00/100 if sold here.</p>

<p>His debts, as far as I can find
and through an advertisement I 
put in the papers here, are as

<p>I think the rest of the Consulate

and the Funeral Expenses (paid by
me) ought to be repaid to me by the
Department, the house having been
rented in the name of the Government, 
and I having assumed
the responsibility of the burial,
however I await the reply of the 
Department authorizing me to draw 
for the same.</p>

<p>A Mr. Steele has presented
himself from Cabinda, as co-manager
with Mr. Judson of Bishop Taylor's
mission there, Mr. Judson having 
been Superintendent of same. They
were also engaged in a small business
there together. Mr. MacLean of
Bishop Taylor's mission here, certifies
to the above description of Mr. Steele
and as he has a better opportunity
of selling the effects for better prices
there than we can get here, I intend
handing over to him such effects for
sale, he guaranteeing to hand to me 
the proceeds, as sold. I hope I
have done right in this as I am
<catchwords>afraid</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_300010.jpg"/>

afraid if I were to sell them here
they would not bring the valve I
have placed on them as old clothes.</p>

<p>A wooden box also exists
belonging to a Sailor of an American
Whaler, name unknown, also a 
tin trunk marked No 5, supposed
to have been left by a man named 
Cameron when on a journey into 
the interior, and not yet claimed,
contents as per inventory.</p>

<p>I can find no account book

is owing to him, or if he had any

no one has offered to pay me anything

but to one a little more salubrious, venture
to beg of Your Excellency the appointment as
representation of the United States Government
at some other place should there be a vacancy.</p>

<p>When passing the Cape de Verde
Islands I had the pleasure of meeting the
American Consul there (at St. Thiago) who
told me he had suffered greatly of late
through fevers, and did not feel at all satisfied,
and desired to leave as soon as possible.
Should this be the case I may say that
Your Excellency could rely upon my faithfully
fulfilling the duties of that post, I being
thoroughly conversant with the Portuguese
language, and well acquainted with the
inhabitants of that Island, and where am
<catchwords>very</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_300022.jpg"/>

<p>During my stay with Messieurs
Newton Carnegie &amp; Co at Loanda I had ample
time to study the duties of the Consulate, and
often performed same under Vice Consul
Robert Scott Newton's supervision.</p>

<p>It has long been my earnest
desire to serve the American Government and
should Your Excellency deem it advisable to
grant me an appointment at S Thiago or 
any other port. I can only say that I
shall always have the interests of the
Government at heart, and endeavor in every
way to prove myself worthy of the honor, conferred
upon us. I am 25 years of age, and

interview I shall be only too happy to cross

<p>Honorable<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In reply to the circular from
the Department, dated November 25,
I have the honor to report:</p>

<p>1st. There are no refrigerators
in this Consular district.</p>

<p>2nd. Being unacquainted with 
the construction of them or their
operation under different conditions,
I cannot say if any peculiar
feature would be requisite for
this district, unless it might be 
that the machine ought to be an
ice-making one and refrigerator
combined.</p>

<p>3rd Answered in first paragraph.</p>

<p>4th " " " "</p>

<p>5th There are a few, not more
<catchwords>than</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_400013.jpg"/>

three or four small French ice-machines 
in use here, and not 
one of them is capable of turning
out more than may be, two or
three kilos of ice per day. They
are seldom put to such use however,
the cooling of water being the
usual content of their services.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the charge
would be per 100 lb of ice if that
quantity could be produced here
for sale. I can however say that
for about a quart of lemonade
made of lime-juice, sugar and
this machine cooled water a charge
of thirty cents is made. Value of lime
juice and sugar
5 cents.</p>

<p>A machine turning out 100 to
200 kilos of block-ice per day,
(refrigerator combined) would
meet the present wants of this city.</p>

<p>The principal hotel proprietor
of the place. Mr F. Frugier, is 
anxious to purchase such a
machine, but not at prompt
payment, as his capital is very,
<catchwords>limited</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40014.jpg"/>

limited. He suggests payment of
a certain proportion on delivery
and rest by instalments.</p>

<p>I would suggest that catalogues
with designs be forwarded to me, 
stating price, cost of working
to produce 100 to 200 kilos of ice,
and in fact such necessary
particulars as will enable me 
to lay the matter clearly before
people who might become purchasers.</p>

<p>There are no means here of
preserving food and liquids
and if the cost does not bar the
<unclear>way</unclear>, the introduction of refrigerators
would be a boon to many, as meat
turns bad here in twenty four hours.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the
Department that my leave of absence
expires on the 30th inst, and as my
health will not permit me to 
return to the Coast for some time,
I feel it my duty to tender my
resignation as Vice Consul.
From my experience of the two last
Consuls sent to Loanda, I take
the Liberty to suggest to the
Department that it would be
advisable to have a resident
Vice Consul of experience at
Loanda, whether another Consul
may be appointed or not, and

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, November 19, 1890</p>

<p>Honorable W. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
 Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your despatch dated
September 11, 1890, enclosing a copy 
of a letter from Mrs Adelaide W
Holmes to the Department of
State in which that lady claims
the sum of <unclear>Rs</unclear> 360.00 for property
belonging to her late husband
and alleged by her to have been 
robbed from the Cabin of the barque
"Sea Fox" (of which vessel he was
Captain) when the arrived in Loanda
and was placed in the charge of the 
officials of the Port. This claim she
makes on the ground of the "inefficiency
or <del>incompetency</del> neglect" of the Consul at
Loanda.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40023.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 2 -->

<p>The whole of the Sad circumstances
attending the explosion on board
the vessel in question were reported
at the time by Vice Consul Newton
to the Department. I will therefore
confine my reply, to the allegations
contained in the claim set forth.</p>

<p>1st "That with the assistance
of a Portuguese national vessel
their <unclear>lying</unclear> in or near Equimina
the "Sea Fox" was taken to St. Paul
de Loanda."</p>

<p>The Portuguese national
vessel took a number of burnt
and wounded men to Loanda
but had nothing to do with taking
the ship there. The Vice Consul
sent a man by the Earliest opportunity
to bring her to this port.</p>

<p>2nd "That at the instance of said
consul or through his agency, Customs
officers were put on board the said
"Sea Fox""</p>

<p>The Customs officers were sent
on board by the Director of Customs
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40024.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 7 -->

verifying the truth of such 
alleged conversation. Considering
however the character of Mr
Newton, the conscientious manner
in which he performed the duties
of this Consulate for a period
extending over twenty years as
I gather from the archives, and
his willingness at all times to
assist in getting justice done
even where he is not personally
concerned, confirm me in the
opinion that either the whole
truth regarding such reply of
his as alleged, is suppressed, or
that it is entirely imaginary
on the part of Captain Luce
or whoever is responsible
for the statement.</p>

<p>To establish the claim I again
submit that it is necessary
for the claimant to produce
the list "as scheduled by the
Consul or his Agent" duly
authenticated by the signature
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40025.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 8 -->

of such Consul or Agent; and 
in conclusion would ask if 
the Consul is responsible to the
owners for safe delivery of property
from the time their agent takes
change in a foreign port until 
he delivers such property in the
home port. If any robbery was 
committed it may have been
done in such interval.</p>

<p>I trust the Department
will accept my assurance 
that all the foregoing is simply
in answer to the claim and the
terms in which it is made, and
I should regret very much if
any single phrase should be
construed as showing a want
of the high respect due from 
me to the Department.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your most obedient<lb/>
servant<lb/>
Ed Bannister.<lb/>
Vice Consul.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40026.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 3 -->

<p>as is done according to law in every
case of arrival of a vessel in port,
and the Consul has nothing whatever
to do with such proceeding.</p>

<p>3rd "And that during the 
time the ship was in charge of the
said officials, the Captain's entire
effects, previously scheduled by the
Consul or his agent, and consisting
of clothing &amp;c, &amp;c. were stolen and
taken from the ship."</p>

<p>When the vessel arrived here
the V Consul was at Mossamedes
very ill, and the writer acting
for him, immediately proceeded
on board and found the entire
space which had once been occupied
by the Cabin, a black, foul smelling
hole without a vestige of Cabin
from side to side and from deck
to Keelson, the result of the explosion,
and the fire consequent thereon
which the crew said raged for
some time.</p>

<p>Burnt and otherwise mutilated
<catchwords>portions</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40027.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 4 -->

portions of written matter,
unrecognizable as documents
of importance or otherwise, were 
<unclear>lying</unclear> scattered about the desk
which was shewn with wreckage
caused by the explosion. On my 
asking if anything belonging
to the Captain had been saved
(simply with a view to secure
for his friends some souvenir),
the reply was in the following
terms as far as my memory
serves me, and I know that at 
the time if made a great impression
on me, considering the awful
circumstances: "My God
Sir, do you think any one thought
of anything else when he recovered
from the shock but putting
out the fire and saving the
ship from going right down
under us"</p>

<p>There remained more than
20 men of the crew, and they
demanded to be taken ashore

<pb facs="ViewScan_40028.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 5 -->

and provided for. I had to
make provision for them (they
had neither food nor place to 
sleep in), and also provide
for the ship's safety and that
of her cargo. The man who 
brought the vessel from Equimina
said he would not have gone
for her if he had known what
he would have to put up with.
He had to sleep (when he could)
on the open deck, there was 
no food except a little fish
and sweet potatoes, and when
he arrived here he was in a
high state of fever.</p>

<p>I would ask respectfully
if under such circumstances
the Consul's duty was to hurt
up a few trinkets or other articles
(which I am firmly convinced
did not exist), or do his duty
by the ship, her cargo and the 
crew?</p>

<p>"The Captain's entire effects
<catchwords>previously</catchwords>

<pb facs="ViewScan_40029.jpg"/><!-- PAGE 6 -->

previously scheduled by the
Consul or his agent."</p>

<p>I will refrain from making
any comment on this assertion,
but respectfully ask the Department
to demand from the concocters
of this claim the list of effects
"scheduled by the Consul or
his Agent" with the signature
of the Consul, or his agent attached.</p>

<p>4th. "And that upon representation
of the robbery being made to the 
Consul by the Captain who had
been sent to St Paul de Loanda
to bring the ship to her home
port, the Consul replied that
nothing could he done about"
it".</p>

<p>This of course implies that
a list as set forth in the claim
and "as scheduled by the Consul"
or his agent" really existed. Let
them produce it. In the
absence of Mr Newton, late 
Vice Consul, I have no means of
<catchwords>verifying</catchwords>    </p>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
of St. Paul de Loanda, <unclear>Vineland, N.J.</unclear> June 20, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>As suggested by you, I have written a brief
Report on the need and possibility of direct
steam communication between the United 
States and Africa. This report I enclose 
with a request to submit it to the Post-Master 
General who in considering the 
question of encouraging the formation of
a line of steamer to Africa.</p>

<p>With the report I also enclose a biographic 
sketch of myself, which may qualify
the credit to be given to the information contained 
in the report, and the opinion
of Mr. Stanley on trading between the U.S. 
and Africa.</p>

<p>All being well, I expect to sail from New
York on the 27th inst. My New York
address is: 118  E. 45th St.</p>

<p>Report
on the need of direct steam communication 
between the United States
and Africa.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>General Facts and Conclusions</p>

<p>(1) The industry and commerce of the U.S. 
need: (a) raw material for the factories 
(b) a market for the overproduction 
of manufactures.</p>

<p>(2) A look at Africa's extent and untapped 
resources prove that it will be,
in the near future, the greatest producer
of raw material, the greatest consumer
of foreign manufacturers, and the best field
for skilled labor.</p>

<p>(3) The U.S. has the advantage over
any other nation in its possibilities as
a consumer of African produce and a producer 
of material needed for the upbuilding
of Africa's civilization.</p>

<p>(4) Geographically, the distance between
the U.S. and W. Africa (south of the
Sahara) is not greater then that between

<pb facs="ViewScan_50007.jpg"/>

England or Germany and West Africa.
Nor are the Cape Verde Islands any
farther removed from the U.S. than
are England and Germany.</p>

<p>(5) Within five or six years the tonnage
between England, Germany, Portugal,
and W. Africa has more than doubled,
while France and Belgium, and also
private firms, leave added new lines
to said coast.</p>

<p>(6) The U.S. shipping to Africa, which
was considerable previous to the river, has
steadily decreased, solely because steam
has not been added to sail, and
because other lines from Europe have 
been allowed to draw the trade
over the doubly long route of England
and Germany.</p>

<p>(7) The present exchange of productions
and movement of passengers between
American and Africa, including what
goes via England, Portugal and Germany 
would suffice to warrant the
establishment of a modern line of steamers, 
but the best would follow its <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50008.jpg"/>

<p>(8) At present it takes letters from
Angola and Congo from six to eight
weeks to reach New York. A line
of steamers going direct to Cape Verde
Islands, and thence down the Coast
at the average rate of trading steamers
would reach Liberia in a fortnight
and the Congo and Angola in eight
to twelve days more; that is in
half the time now required.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Personal observations</p>

<p>(1) I have sailed, or rather steamed, 
four times along the West Coast of
Africa, seeing all points of any importance 
between <del>the</del> Madeira and
Mossamedes, at the southern extremity 
of Angola. Never had I a chance to
travel on an American trading vessel:
the first outward-bound voyage I made
(in 85) by the British and African S.S.
Line, the second on the U.S.S.
"Pensacola"; the first northward trip
I made on Portuguese man of war
"Africa" and the second on the Portu-

<pb facs="ViewScan_50009.jpg"/>

guese packet to St. Vincent (Porto Grande)
and thence by tramp-steamer to Philadelphia.
The first voyage from Liverpool to Loanda
took almost eight weeks. The last voyage
from Loanda to Philadelphia took <del>about</del>
twenty one days; exclusive of 5 days stoppage
at S. Thomé and three days at St. Vincent.</p>

<p>My mission being scientific and <unclear extent="one word"/>
only such commercial facts as forced
themselves on me were noticed and 
can now be collected. A special study
would reveal much more hopeful indications.</p>

<p>(2) The Cape Verde Islands</p>

<p>At St. Vincent, Mr. Randall, father,
who was a long time U.S. Consular Agt
remembers the time when Port Grande
was a miserable hamlet of fisher-huts.
Now it is a large town and one of the 
guest harbors of the world. Nearly all
the houses are covered in shingles, and
these as well as the timber come from 
America.</p>

<p>Here the bark of Mr. <unclear>Betman</unclear> of Boston,

<pb facs="ViewScan_50010.jpg"/>

of W. H. Mitchell, N.Y. and probably
that of Yates and Porterfield, touch
at regular intervals on their way to
Dakar, Goree and Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>The Cape Verde Islanders, as many 
of them told me, are more American
than Portuguese. Every man, who gets
a chance, wants to see the U.S.A.
great many are U.S. citizens, having 
been nationalized as sailor on American
vessels. I know of a sailing vessel that
<unclear>salled</unclear> at Brava and got there a
full cargo of passengers at 50 dollars.
A direct line of steamers can reckon
on a regular supply of passengers to 
and from the U.S. and Cape Verde Islands.
As a winter resort some of these Island
will soon vie with Madeira, the Azores
and the Canaries. Americans would no
doubt soon prefer them to Madeira at
the Canaries.</p>

<p>The reports of the U.S. Consul at Santiago 
ought to show that there is now 
some direct and indirect export from
Cape Verde Islands to the U.S.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50011.jpg"/>

<p>(3) Senegambia and Sierra Leone</p>

<p>The above mentioned American firms
are constantly sending there some bark
and I suppose the Department is better
informed than I on the business they 
do.</p>

<p>(4) Liberia</p>

<p>The connection of this colony of ours
with the motherland and European
nations is too well known for me
to dwell on it. Liberia alone would 
furnish enough passengers and freight
movement to support a small steamer
and many others to follow, if the 
custom barrier between mother and
daughter were lowered.</p>

<p>(5) Gold Coast, Niger, Cameroons,
Gaboon, S. Thomé, and Congo</p>

<p>Wherever I have been, at all
points of the Coast and Islands I
have found the same desire of
traders wishing to get goods direct
from America, of shipping produce
in the same way, and of educated
nations wishing to get passage to the

<pb facs="ViewScan_50012.jpg"/>

"big country" not to settle there, but
to learn its ways.</p>

<p>There is no conception in America
of the immense resources of all 
kinds stood up in those regions, nor 
of the mysterious, magnet like, power of attraction
this republic exerts on the minds of
Africans the moment they emerge from
tribal isolation. </p>

<p>(6) Angola</p>

<p>In this province, which is regularly
visited by the monthly lines of Germany 
and France, the tri-weekly of England,
and the bi-weekly of Portugal, the 
need of direct steam communication
with the U.S. seems to be realized 
with the clearest consciousness, especially
since the recent troubles with England.
One Jewish firm charting every year
a few sailing vessels to bring lumber,
kerosene, flour, furniture etc. from
the States and the profits it realizes 
are larger than it is willing to confess.
The Schooner "Horace Scudder" that 
used to visit all ports of Angola

<pb facs="ViewScan_50013.jpg"/>

yearly, will a mixed cargo of American 
goods, has been greatly missed for this
last few years. A whole batch of
traders used planters are already now
writing to me of their intention to visit
the Chicago Fair and to see with
with their own eyes how best to establish
and extend direct commercial relations
with this country.</p>

<p>As soon as I reach my post, I
hope to be able to give exact statistics
of the important agriculture and trade
and of the immense resources of that
large province.</p>

<p>(7) Cape Colony (and South African
Republics</p>

<p>Considering that the water route
between the U.S. and the Cape and
that between England and the Cape
are practically equal, there is no
reason why this country could not
compete on that promising market
in all those articles in which it
does compete in Europe.</p>

<p>Nor should the deep sympathy

<pb facs="ViewScan_50014.jpg"/>

between the <unclear extent="one word"/> United States
of South-Africa and their model
on this hemisphere be forgotten.</p>

<p>(8) Summing my observation
on all the West-Coast I may state</p>

<p>(a) that all this lumber, kerosene,
flour, and canned meats that is used
on the West-Coast comes directly or
indirectly from America.</p>

<p>Lately, however, Norwegia is has begun to seriously
compete with America in the lumber
trade.</p>

<p>(b) In cotton-goods (which form the
most important article of importation
in Africa), preserved fruit and meats
(especially corned beef and salt pork)
in machinery for agriculture, tools
and implements of all kinds, rolling
stock for railways, cheap clock and
watches, cheap furniture, notions
and intentions of all kinds, patent
<unclear>mediums</unclear>, etc. the United States
can compete with other nations as
soon as the goods have not to
travel over England and Germany.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50015.jpg"/>

<p>(c) The main produce of Africa, as it
is now, india-rubber, ivory, pea-nuts,
skins, wax, dye stuffs, ginger, <unclear>cainwood</unclear>, 
coffee, cocoa, kola-nuts &amp; fibres, etc.
are all wanted in the U.S. as much
as in Europe.</p>

<p>Whether palm-oil would find here
as good a market as in Europe I
cannot say but I don't see why it
should not.</p>

<p>(d) As to the quantity its sufficiency is proved by the fact that
steamers have rapidly increased in
size and number so that now there
are ten regular lines of steamers, besides
a number belonging to Coast trading firms
when six or seven years ago there
was only the English line with
the then modest beginnings of the
now powerful German line.</p>

<p>(9) American missionaries in Africa</p>

<p>Exclusive of the United Presbyterian
in Egypt, who would never use
the Africa lines, there are now
in Africa American missionaries
representing 18 religious organizations</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50016.jpg"/>

<p>1. The United Brethren, with their prosperous,
Colony-like mission among the Mende
of Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>2. The Kansas Soudan Mission of the Y.M.C.A.
with coast-station at Sierra Leone</p>

<p>3. Wesleyan Methodists at Sierra Leone</p>

<p>4. Free Methodists in Sierra Leone, and
Liberia, and East-Coast and going to extend to Congo
and other parts.</p>

<p>5. African Methodist Episcopal in 
Liberia</p>

<p>6. Methodist Episcopal in Liberia, Congo,
Angola.</p>

<p>7. Protestant Episcopal in Liberia.</p>

<p>8. Lutherans in Liberia.</p>

<p>9. Mormonites in Liberia.</p>

<p>10. Southern Baptists in Yorubaland</p>

<p>11. Northern Presbyterians in German
Cameroons, and French Gaboon and
Spanish Corisco.</p>

<p>12. Southern Presbyterian on Congo</p>

<p>13. Northern Baptists on Congo</p>

<p>14. Christian Alliance on Congo</p>

<p>15. American Board in Angola, and
East-Africa, and Zululand</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50017.jpg"/><!-- START HERE -->

<p>16. Swedish Lutherans on Congo.</p>

<p>17. Friends in Madagascar</p>

<p>18. Roman Catholics, in different fields.</p>

<p>To these should be added a 
number independent missionaries.
The total number of these missionaries
is set down as 204; but it is really
considerably higher, for the women 
are not included in that enumeration.
These American missionaries are 
assisted in their work by more than
600 native evangelists. The money
expended on these American and native missionaries 
is more than 250,000 <unclear>1/100</unclear>
per year.</p>

<p>There are enough indications to make
it almost certain That next year
will see an unprecedented rush of
American missionaries to African so
that the above number will soon
be doubled and trebled.</p>

<p>Now, almost to a man, these missionaries 
with their families travel via
England and bring their outfit and
that of their stations in Europe,
simply because there is no direct
line of steamers</p>

<p>U.S. Commercial Agency<lb/>
at St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
Lisbon, July 24, 1891</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>
to the Hon. William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to report my
arrival at this port, en route to
St. Paul de Loanda, and to mention 
some of the difficulties met 
on this route.</p>

<p>1) The shortest, or rather quickest,
route to Angola (St. Paul de Loanda)
is that of the Portuguese mail,
provided one is able to find suitable
communication between England and

<pb facs="ViewScan_50024.jpg"/>

Portugal. I had read of the project,
or decision, of having steamers sail
from Lisbon to Loanda on the 21st
and 6th of each month; but not being
sure, I determined to inquire in
New York. Here the Portuguese Consul
knew only of the departures on the 6th;
Cook's Agency <unclear>idem</unclear>. I sailed to 
England by first opportunity in
order to find out there, both about
the Lisbon packets for Loanda and
the steamers from England to Loanda.</p>

<p>2) In England I learnt that there 
is indeed a steamer leaving Lisbon
on the 21st and there I might
catch it by one of the Southampton
steamers, all of whom were due in Lisbon
about the some time.</p>

<p>3) The time for the connection being

<pb facs="ViewScan_50025.jpg"/>

very limited, and the required
custom house despatches and visas
of Passport taking to much time,
the steamer of the 21st was missed
and I must wait for the next 
one of the 6th of August, which is
due in Loanda about the 1st of
September.</p>

<p>Besides the visa of the American
Consulate I was obliged to get
another from the Police of the Port
which cost 2.800 reis <unclear extent="one word"/> that
is a little over three dollars. My
baggage had to go through the same
process as that of non-consuls, and
I found that <del>most</del> Portuguese officials think
a Commercial Agent is nothing more
than a Consular Agent.</p>

<p>The result of my experience is that

<pb facs="ViewScan_50026.jpg"/>

although the British and African lines
from Liverpool to Loanda is not the 
most direct nor the quickest in
theory (in the time actually spent
at sea) yet it is the most convenient 
both as regards speed,
comfort and economy, because the
correspondence between the steamer
from America and that going to 
Loanda can easily be arranged
from America, and there is no
custom house delay nor pass-port
expense etc., to the English
steamers do not call at Lisbon.</p>

<p>4) I am improving the fortright I
am forced to spend here, in getting
useful information on the subject
of commercial possibilities between
my consulate and <del>Angola</del> America, and

<pb facs="ViewScan_50027.jpg"/>

on the plains and purposes of the
colonial centre at Lisbon with regard
to this African colonies. In the present 
crisis, however, nobody knows
what may happen in the nearest
future.</p>

<p>I found the people at Oporto
deeply and seriously excited and
here the highest and lowest clans 
are, so to say carelessly, in response on the "<unclear extent="one word"/>"
looking out for "somebody to do
something or anything", but no one
knows who is to do it, nor what 
is to be done.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to enclose the Report
 on U.S. Coaling stations in Africa
 referred to in our interview when I 
 left Washington, and to beg you to trans
 mit the same to the Navy Department</p>

<p>This Report tries to show what points
are most desirable as coaling-stations
and may possibly be acquired by 
the United States.</p>

 <p>Enclosure no. 1
Report on U.S. Coaling-stations
in Africa, their desirability,
possibly and suitable points.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50031.jpg"/>

<p>Report
on Coaling-stations in Africa.</p>

<p>(1) The desirability of coaling stations
for the U.S. Naby on several points
of Africa is best understood, no
doubt, by the Navy Department, and
needs not to be dwelt upon.</p>

<p>(2) Some of the desirable, and prob
ably acquirable, points are the following:
 a)Fayal, or some other point on 
one of the Azores.-The whole popul
ation of the Azores would rejoice to
see the U.S. acquire some land in 
their islands, and the Portuguese gov
ernment might not object persistant
ly in the present state of affairs
 b)Some part of the Cape Verde Islands,
where the whole population is also</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50032.jpg"/>

<p>most favorably disposed toward the
United States.
(c) An island, or the whole, of Portuguese
Guinea. The sale or abandonment of 
this colony, which has given Portugal noth
ing but trouble and expense, has often
been demanded by Portuguese statesmen
even when the national finances were
in a relatively flourishing condition.
If anything could be got for for it, there
is little doubt that the Portuguese govern
ment and "Cortes would hail with
joy an honorable opportunity of
parting with that <unclear/> colonial
appendage. Under American admin
istration there would need be no fear of 
rebellions like that which the Portu
guese have recently had to deal with.
I think that possessions is both the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50033.jpg"/>

<p>most promising for a good administrat
ion, and the one that can be obtained
on the most favorable terms. The Navy 
Department is the best judge of its
excellency as for a geographical
situation and anchorage are concerned
The climate is, whatever some may
say,not a bit worse than that of 
the British and French possessions
to the north and south of it.
d) Some land might be obtained
on the Principe and St. Thomas Islands,
but Cabinda, just north of the
Congo, mouth, is by far the most
desirable point of the whole coast
and could probably be acquired
either as a whole or, at least, in
part. Portugal has already spent
more money on it than it is worth</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50034.jpg"/>

<p>to a nation that holds so much
valuable lands, and there is no pros-
pect of Portugal extending is as
the expense of either the Congo State
or France. The American fleet of <unclear/>
vessels has for many years make
Cabinda this gathering point, and
the sea-faring Cabindas are well
acquainted with American ships.</p>

<p>This concludes the list of the
available places under the Portuguese
flag and instated on the West-Coast
I know from personal friends con-
nected with more Portuguese states-
men and from the discussion of
the subject in the "Cortes" that
the best solution ,(if a solution be
possible) of the present financial
crisis would be found in these</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50035.jpg"/>

<p>sale of superfluous colonies or terri-
tories, and that the United States
would have the preferences. Only
it is considered inconsistent with
the national dignity to make the
first other. But overtures of the
U.S. on this subject would be wel-
comed, and the mission of Sr. Arroyo
to the U.S. for other objects could
be utilised for negotiations of this 
sort.</p>

<p>It does not look as though there
would be any insuperable difficulty
in obtaining from the Portuguese
some harbor of their East-African
possession.</p>

<p>e) Of the Spanish posession in
West-Africa, which have no prom-
ising future before them unless they</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50036.jpg"/>

<p>fall into better hands, a point of
Fernando Po might be ceded to the 
U.S. as well as to Germany, who
already has a coaling station on that
large island. But Corises, and Benito where
the missionaries of the American
Presbyterian Church (North) have been,
and still are, the only pioneers of
civilization and Christianity, and where
important congregation of converted
have already been gathered, would
seem to be every way a more bearable
site. The island of Anno Bom,
too whose most regular <unclear/> 
our American whaling ships, and
which is to Spain a more source
of expense, might prove to be a 
good place for the object in view.
 f) Finally Liberia, our world</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50037.jpg"/>

<p>and the light-house of the rising
African (native) states, would probab-
ly welcome the moral support which
the pressure of a U.S. coating station
would offer it. Still, some of the
preceding points seem to be preferable,
principally Portuguese Guinea (Bissau
and <unclear/>) Cabinda or Corisco.</p>

<p>The present crisis or Portugal
which cannot last long, at least
in this acute stage, often the
best, and possibly the last,
opportunity for the acquisition
of desirable points for coaling-
stations on the route from America
to Europe (Azores) South Africa,
India and Australia. One 
of the Azores, Portuguese Guinea
and Cabinda would form a</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50038.jpg"/>

<p>splendid <unclear/> both for our
navy and our coming merchant
navy to Africa.</p>

<p>I shall gladly furnish any
more information that may be

<p>No. 10
Consulate of the United States,
at St. Paul de Loanda, Sept 1st, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
 I have the honor to inform you
 that I arrived at my post yesterday
 Aug. 31st by S.S. Ambaca exact
 ly 62 days after sailing from New 
 York and that I have taken charge
 of this Consulate to-day.</p>

<p>The Governor General of Angola had
 already announced my appointment
 and permission to act in the official
 Bulletin of Aug. 22nd.</p>

<p>The archives of the Consulate were trans
ferred to me by Vice-Consul Ed. Ban
nister, and we have together made the
enclosed inventory of the same accor-
ding to the directions contained in the Con
sular Regulations.</p>

<p>Pending the choice of a definite location </p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50041.jpg"/>

<p>I have taken a temporary office at
the house of a reliable friend. The 
partition in Mr. Newton's office, which
was formerly used for the U.S. Consulate
I found already occupied by the British
Consulate.</p>

<p>I also have to advise my drafts
on the Hon. Secretary of the Treasury,
one of the $82.90, for the period of in
structions and another, of $136.99, for my
transit, both in <unclear/> As you already know, it was
not possible for me to reach my
destination within the determined
50 days, nor have my predecessor, that
I know of, been able to do so.</p>

<p>In spite of two years of drought and
consequent scarcity of food, I find Loanda
much improved and commerce flourishing
This is due to the railroad and the 
good prices fetched by native produce.</p>

<p>The political crisis is becoming so
acute, that a joint movement of Por-
tuguese and natives for Angolan inde-
pendence is imminent nor is it prob-
able that the Lisbon government would</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50042.jpg"/>

<p>or could seriously oppose such a
change.In a great meeting,
the leading man of Loanda, irres-
pective of party or color, have pro-
tested against teh cession of the Lunde
to the Congo State, and resolved to
frustrate the permission given the
same State to contract 500 natives
in Angola. And they have done
it so effectually that the Congo State
Agent has withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Department shall soon hear
more on these subjects.</p>

<p>As, to my knowledge, there
is no American Consul on the Congo,
I take the liberty to inform the
Department of the decease of Vivi,
on the 12th Aug. of Christian
Borella a native of Denmark
and naturalized American citizens.</p>

<p>After a long cover of usefulness
in and out of the employ of the
New York Seamen's Missionary 
Society, Borella sailed about
three years ago, for Liberia Fever-</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_50043.jpg"/>

<p>worn he took a trip to Cape-Town,
and <unclear/> came to Loanda, whence
he went to the infant stations of
Bishop Taylor's Mission. He was 
appointed Captain of Bishop Taylor's
steamer on the Lower Congo, and
went there, though debilitated.
On Aug. 10th he was seized by 
<unclear/> fever, and on the 12th fol-
lowing, at 4 a.m., he breathed his
last. Bishop Taylor was with him
on Vivi. hill, and nursed him; but
in vain.</p>

<p>Living and traveling at his own
expense, full of love to all man,
humble, studious and hardworking,
Christian Borella was cherished
wherever he went, his death and will be
lamented by many,in Africa as
well as in New-York.</p>

Your most obedient servant

<p>No. 11
Consulate of the United States,
at Loanda, Sept. 30, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
 Washington,D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have to acknowledge the receipt of instructions
no 7. stating that any report on direct steam
communication with W. Africa had been received
and copy transmitted to Postmaster General.
 I have also received the circulars, dated
June, 20, 23, 26, 17, 25, July 1, 14, and 
duly noted contents; I will answer the
queries made in two of them, as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>During the portion of quarter ending this
day and beginning Sept 1., date of my assu-
ming my duties, no American Vends have
entered or left this port and no fees have
been received at this Consulate .</p>

<p>For the same period I enclose Form
no. 25, 90, 103, 109, 117, 118, &amp; 119.
 The balance of my account for salary</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60002.jpg"/>

<p>and contingent expenses is $82. 91/100 for
which amount I have drawnon the Hon.
Secretary of the Treasury in favor of Messes.
Bywalen, Fanqueray &amp; Phayse, 17 Broadway
New-York.</p>

<p>As the officials and people here constantly
conformed a Commercial Agent with a Consular
Agent, it will be well to have my title
changed to that of Consul as soon as possible.</p>

<p>From a letter of the Treasury Department
to Mr. Downing, it appears that he was al
lowed ninety days salary for period of 
transit. Based on this precedent, if <unclear/>
I take the liberty to ask the Department,
if possible, to allow me my salary for the 
days (exceeding the fifty drawndrawn for) which
I necessarily spent on the way to this port.
I sailed from New York on july 1st, arrived 
in Loanda on Aug. 31 took charge on Sept

 I have to acknowledge the receipt of
your Circular dated July 17, 20, 27
whose intents were duly noted.</p>

<p>Enclosed I have the honor to trans
mit to the Department:

<pb facs="ViewScan_60004.jpg"/>

<p>Report on present State
and Needs of U.S. Consulate at
 St. Paul de Loanda</p>

<p>From the Inventory sent last march, The Dep
artment, could infer, to some extent, what this
Consulate has and what it lacks; but a de
tailed report on the present state and needs
of the Consulate is merely not out of place.</p>

<p>1) The Office
This used to be in Mr. Newton's office, in 
a corner partitioned off by a common wall about
8 feet high, and when I took charge, That corner
had been evaluated in favor of the British
Consul (newly appointed) and the U.S. archives
were piled up in Mr. Newton's business office.</p>

<p>As the Department probably known, Mr.
Newton has retired to Europe and his business
here is in charge of clerk. Mr. Ed Ban
nister is no longer connected with Mr. Newton's
firm. Whether the two Consular archives, American
and British, and to be kept in the same room
or partition, I am not sure of, but think they
were.</p>

<p>Until a better place can be found, I
have hired two rooms as the American 
Mission, me myself. The other for office</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60005.jpg"/>

<p>The letter is on the ground-floor, has a door
to the point front of the house, and another door opening 
into the schoolroom which is only used on Sundays.
A partition will reaching to the ceiling, separates
the office from the store-room of the mission.
MY bed-room is up-stairs.</p>

<p>2) The furniture
As appears from the Inventory, nothing was 
turned over to me but the maiden remains of
a few chain, and two ruined book-cases, which
letter Mr. Bannister was not sure belonged to
the Consulate.</p>

<p>I furnished the office with some of my own,
and borrowed chain, table, and repaired me
small book-case. To these I added a table
and book shelves, which I made myself
from old boxes. The walls I adorned with
African and other maps of my own, so
that the office, the poorly furnished,
book pretty decent and comfortable.
 Considering, however, the rapidly grow
 ing importance of this port and the 
 nation represented at this Consulate, its 
 office should, in justice,be properly fur-
 nished. Furniture is very dear at Loanda;
 so I propose to the Department to either
 appropriate a sufficient seem to buy said</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60006.jpg"/>

<p>furniture here (counting the cost here to be
at least 100% more than it would be in the 
States) or to send a full supply of office 
furniture from the States.</p>

<p>If this Consulate be henceforth part in 
charge of decent men, and detailed inven
tories required of them, the Department may
be sure that the furniture will be properly
cared for.</p>

<p>3) Office paraphernalia 
Of these nothing was turned over except what
is mentioned in the Inventor (Two stamp,
a few waifers, sheets of paper and envelopes).
The stamp mentioned as "handstamp" bear
the inscription "Commercial Agency" and is
therefore no longer correct, nor is it in good con-
dition. Letter-files needed.</p>

<p>Just now I have received from the Depart.
ment a supply of forms and stationary, but 
as ink nor string. These shall have to buy
The press, mentioned in former inventories,
has not been transformed and may have
disappeared in Judson? time. One ought
to be sent by first opportunity. As there is 
no bookbinder in this place, it would seem
admirable for the Department to send some
material wherewith the officer might that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60007.jpg"/>

<p>himself what things require binding (and thre
are (some). Packing paper, too, which, here, is
rather high, should be not but not with myself lot.</p>

<p>4)The Archives
a)Forms. Of these, more than
half were obsolete, but no mixed up, that 
it took me several days' hard work to
sort the antiquated from the good and
to sort and arrange the latter.</p>

<p>The result in that the Forms lacking, even 
after arrival of those such with stationary to
me, are Nos: 1 to 12 incl. 88 &amp; 89
 1593
 1997-99 incl.
 26-32 incl.104
 34 &amp; 35-106-111.
 40-67114 &amp; 115
 69-78125
 80 &amp; 81 131-137
143-144
146-152 incl.
160-166</p>

<p>Any of these that are deemed by the Depart
ment to be of sufficient importance shall be
seat, in moderate numbers, by first opportunity.</p>

<p>b) BooksThe list of those extent is found 
 in the Inventory.
The set of books pertaining tot he S. Thomé
 consulate is all blank. It might serve for 
 a Consular Agency in that island when one
be established. That me will have to be estab:
lished there is sure as soon as direct co-
munication between W. Africa and states 
be apst. S. Thomé &amp; Principe are un
for the production for coffee, cocoa and fine timber.
They also offer a good market for higher clan
goods, such as are produced by America.

<pb facs="ViewScan_60009.jpg"/>

<p>The Record-Book was used by Downing to copy some
extravagant letters to high personages, and since, by
Newton's clerks and Bannister, to why letters and
documents said from subjects to Department </p>

<p>There is nothing in it previous to Downing &amp; 1888.
The Letters sent has a few writings in 1883, a few
in 1888 and regular ones since 1889,
The Letters received contain entries since and
of 1888
The Two old Dispatch Books mention in Inventory
contain one; Arthur Libal's &amp; Newton's dispatches
between oct. 1864 and march 1878, Jackson's 
from letter date to April 1878, the Newton's
to march 1879.
The other: Newton's dispatches from April
 1879 to Dec. 1879 and after a last of 3 years, there from june 1883 to
 June 1885
 In a thrid, unbound, volume are dispatches
 and letters from Sept. 1885 to oct. 1887

 and official letter from Jan. 1880 to oct. 1887 (Du

<p>Record-Book Lacking:
A Letter Book, into which to copy official letters
 apart from Dispatches to U.S. Departments.
A Miscellaneous Record-book, though the
 old are, mixed as its contents are might
 continue to be used for its <unclear/> purpose.
A Record of Commercial Returns
A Quarterly Account-<unclear/> Book
An Index-Book.</p>

<p>As may being informed from the above the
two latter Records were never kept, which 
made it most to impossible to find anything
dating book to a predecessor.</p>

<p>The Inventory tells what printed
books there are, and in what condition. from
it can be inferred what book may be
lacking</p>

<p>The Consular Reports were never taken
care of; so the collection is most important</p>

<p>C) Correspondence
 This I found in utmost confusion except
the latest, sent to Bannister since he had 
sole charge.
 It took me a long time to sort what</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60011.jpg"/>

<p>there is, and now all the letters are chrono,
logically arranged in different packages, <unclear/>
thing binding.</p>

<p>The division is:
Package (1) Instruction from State Dept.
(incomplete but beginning ink a few
 addressed to Anchor Libra)(2) Circular from State Dept.
(same remark)
 (3) Letters from Treasury Dept.
 (4) Official letters from other 
Consulate
 (5) Official letters from Portuguese
authorities 9such as on left)
 (6) Letters and documents concerning
crews and ships
 (7) Letters and documents concerning 
missions
 (8) Judson's private letters &amp;
accounts (a most <unclear/>
 bundle).
Excepting Newton's and Du Verge's, though
both incomplete, scarcely any correspondence
has escaped.
It is high time to bind what is left.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60012.jpg"/>

<p>5)Flagstaff and flags.
As stated in last mail, Newton's clerk
 said they were not sure whether the flagstaff
 belonged to Consulate or not. I chowed
 them since the letter of the Department
 authorizing Mr. Newton to spend $25.-
 on purchases and erection of me and they
 said that did not prove that Mr. Newton
 actually got the money, and that I should
 get Mr. Bannister (now <unclear/> from
 Newton, Carnegie's) to declare whether the
 money was received or not. I have not
 yet been able to find Mr. Bannister 
 since that time and so the matter is
 standing, until I see Mr. Bannister,
 when, no doubt, the matter will be satis
 factorily decided.</p>

<p>Still, for either the removal and erection
 of trades or the purchase of a new staff, I beg
 the Department to allow me to spend,
 in first can not more than five dollars,
 and in the latter case teh maximum of
 twenty five dollars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have, on convenient occasions
hoisted the flag on the flag staff of the 
Mission House when the Comander office temporarily located</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60013.jpg"/>

<p>As to the flags, the boat-flag though some
what moth-eaten will yet do for the rare occa
sion of this port; but the large flag, already
torn at the corners, needs being <unclear/>
as fast as another box comes fro the De
partment. It would be wise to send with 
the flag some cones of <unclear/> to ward off
insects.</p>

<p>6)Consular Officers
The arranging of the consular correspond
 ence and its <unclear/> have given me, toge
 ther with what I gathered here from conver
 sations, a very fair idea of the history and 
 work of each successive Consular officer.</p>

<p>The impression, that history leaves, is most pain
 ful for an America. Excepting Archer Libra,
 who was the most popular and generous
 trader Loanda had in this century, all the
 Americans who have held these port were fit
 for the penitentiary and the gallows rather
 than for the office of representatives of the
 United States. Of Jackson I know nothing
 as he was here but as a passenger.</p>

<p>That the only one to maintain the dignity
 of the office in all that line, should have
 been an Englishman, Mr Newton, is rather
 humiliating; and not less humiliating</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60014.jpg"/>

<p>is the fact that he used to give the American
consulate openly or tacitly as part-salary to
one of his clerk.</p>

<p>Now, as Angola is being more and more 
occupied by American Missions, as its commercial im
portance is fast growing, and as there is no
doubt that are long it will form a power
ful independent state with strong sympa
thies for the United States, it is of the 
highest importance, that, should I be replaced
from decision any other cause, the standard
of this Consulate, which I shall have raised
out of the mud, be never again lowered
by sending here men who are a disgrace
to their country and to mankind, even in darkest
Africa.</p>

<p>But this improvement in the personal
of the Consulate depends shiftly on the
Salary. While I, who have got a repu
tation as a philanthropic Diogram can
manage to live and do some good with my
salary there is no doubt but that an
ordinary man, requesting the society of the
other consuls and Consular agents can impi
sibly get along with the salary of the post.
The price for a poorly furnished room
and board (two meals a day, as any one
of the two or three better hotels of the place so</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60015.jpg"/>

<p>2.75 per day, if taken by the week or month,
and the extras entailed by living in such a hotel
make the expense of an additional 50¢ to one dollar
per day necessary.</p>

<p>The only way for a Consul to keep out of debt
would be to accept a situation as clerk or to 
go into business with some capital. Thus the
Department in confronted with this dilemma; 
either have a trading Consul who will take care
not to have American competition in the Province
&amp; these hinder rather than advance the commercial
interests he is supposed to promote, or have
a consul, who will give his time and talents
to the consular business, and pay him enough
to enable him to do so. Angola, with its 600.000
square miles of the best land in the world, and Loa
anda, whose custom <unclear/> cleared last year, in
writer of all struggling 550.000 $00, deserve some
thing better than a last-class Consulate.</p>

<p>In a city like Loanda a salary of two 
thousand dollars should be the minimum for
Consul for Schedule B.</p>

<p>Heli Chatelain
U.S. Cml Agent
P.S. I would also beg teh Department to allow
me 5 million (5$40) for <unclear/> to the "Future F Angola"
and the same for the "Mercantil" another leading papers of Loanda.

<p>Report
on Present Political Situation
of Portugal &amp; Angola.</p>

<p>As promised in my first dispatch
from Angola, I now lay before the Department a
detailed account of political movements within
my Consular District. And first of all, allow
me to state what i noticed on the way from
Lisbon to Loanda.</p>

<p>1) Voyage on S.S. Ambaca
We had on board over 300 Portuguese West-Africa,
but chiefly to Angola. This was only the first batch 
of the crowd to foloow on the by-weekly steamers
of the <unclear/> Nacional. The lot of the "Ambaca"
hailed from OPorts and consisted of hungry work
ingmen all revolutionary Republicans of whom the 
Portuguese government was more or less afraid. As soon
as they were on board these men showed what could
be expected of them. The municipality of OPorts had 
promised all the residents of OPorto a present of
5 <unclear/> =$5.40, but when the agent began to
distribute the money, on board the "Ambaca" and
returned to give that amount $ those who were not
on his list of OPorts-men, the whole crowd resolved
&amp; declared, they would not sail unless all got</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60017.jpg"/>

<p>the same amount. The minister of Marine ordered
to delay the departures of the ship, as company of <unclear/>
Marines was sent on board and the steamer was
surrounded by tugs and launchers from the Marine
Arrival. On the seventh however, the government de
cided to give all men equally 5 <unclear/> and
the "Ambaca" was allowed to sail, after a new
company of marines had been put on board with
a lot of ammunition.</p>

<p>On the way out, however, it soon became evident
that the missions were worse than the emigrants
and during the whole voyage the <unclear/> passages
practically rule the ship. Every time launches went
ashore with cargo there emigrants would simply 
find the ship's officers aside and <unclear/>
boats and have a jolly time ashore. If no accordance
happened, it is due to the Captain and first class
passenger who being all Republicans, let the 
poor fellows have their own way.</p>

<p>As Principe (Prince's Isld.), some of the
emigrants walked up to a plantation where one
of the exiled OPorts rebels is working and made 
him an<unclear/>. There as at other places when the
boats would bring the passengers back in the coming
a red flag would fly on the first launch &amp; the
crowd would sing the "Portuguese" the new
Portuguese Marseillance which the government</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60018.jpg"/>

<p>tried in vain to prohibit in Portugal. Rer the ship
sailed from Principe, a big bon-fire was lit on the
hill when the exiles' plantation his, and the immi-
grants answered with land "vives" for the exile,
pistol-shots and the singing of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>S. Thomé
Here the whole white population was highly
indignant against the Portuguese government and
has just held an excited masking to protest
against following means of the government
1) The change in the export duties by which it
seems almost impossible to export coffee and co-
coa direct &amp; foreign ports, and in the import
<unclear/> which by forcing all foreign goods to from
through the laws of Lisbon agents creates a
rise in the prices of next to all goods.
2) The premium granted to the Congo State
to contract (i.e to buy) 500 natives of Angola,
at a time when S. Thomé a Principe cannot
get a sufficient number of (slave) laborers for
its coffee plantations.
3) The Cession (as it is called) of part of the
Loanda empire to the same Congo State.
 The population of S. Thomé &amp; Principe whose white
population is intimately connected with that of
Angola is now one with the latter in the opinion</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60019.jpg"/>

<p>that the home government is the worst <unclear/> of the
colonies and that the time in come for the latter
to free themselves from the Lisbon magnates.</p>

<p>Kabinda
Here I saw no sign of political excitement,
but admired the magnificent barracks of the 
battalions statement here and the beautiful palace
of the governor. I talked with some of the soldiers
and found that most of them are from the dis-
strict of Loanda; as for back to the interior as
Kasanji (600 miles);who were pressed into the
service. As Kabinda they take native women,
&amp; so the Kabinda race is being rapidly mixed
with the Angolan. Soon all the Kabinda women 
(who hitherto only <unclear/> Fiste or Kongo) will
know Kimbandu (or Angolan) which most men
already learnt is Loanda or other ports, and vice
verse a great number of Angolans are learning 
Kongo so that when the day of independence
comes, the people of Portuguese Kongo will fuel
one with those of Angola, south of them. Unwitting-
ly, the Portuguese government is doing everything
to mould the greatest of modern black nations</p>

<p>Commercially, I noticed that the great Dutch

<p>Banana business, and those escape to some extent the
vexation taxation and regulation of the Kongo State</p>

<p>As the Portuguese steamers no longer
Banana and the Portuguese port at S. Antonio
has no great importance, I saw little of the state
of affairs on the Congo, and what I heard the
Department may know from its agent out there (?).</p>

<p>Ambiz
 This place lives entirely from the coffee which
the rations bring from the interior, and owes its
importance and prosperity to the fact that its tariff
is very moderate compared to that of Loanda.
I heard that Mr. Newton has obtained a concession
for a company to work again the old and rich
copper-mines of Bemba, back of Ambiz</p>

<p>Loanda.
 Here I noticed immediately that a new
life has come into the old city and that it
will soon count among the great parbon of the
world. The change that has taken place in the
18 months of my absence is wonderful. Politically,
the spirit of indpendence has <unclear/> from the
natives to which and the question is colored
in the minds of the leaving men. Be it sufficient
to state that the first thing, on <unclear/>
again, which the two first men of Loanda
(the first lawyer &amp; the director of the Bank) told</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60021.jpg"/>

<p>me in a whisper was : Things are in but shape
in Portugal, are they not? The Republic and
the independence of this are not for. Both these
men have about 20 years residence in Loanda, &amp;
have made up their minds to finish their careers
in these parts. One of them is already limited are
is the future President.</p>

<p>Shortly before my arrival, all the leading traders
of Loanda, at the call of native leader, had held
a great indignation-masking and rearbred to protest
against the cession of Loanda and the contracts
allowing the Congo State to buy 500 natives
of Angola. As I already wrote to the Depart-
ment, they also effectually hindered the
purchase of any natives for Kongo State service,
and the agent of the Kongo State, after being
this reason from the shock &amp; the abuse of mor-
phine, had to return to the Kongo without having
obtained anything. It must also be noticed
that the people of Loanda solemnly declared,
and stick to it, that they maintain their <unclear/>
to the part of the Loanda country allowed to the
Kongo State, and they <unclear/> to enforce it as
soon as they see an opportunity.</p>

<p>Annexed to this are 1) The protests
of the capital (Loanda) against the two
contracts with the Congo State, in which</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60022.jpg"/>

<p>protect they declare that for them the Portuguese
parliament does not represent the natives, but is 
only a body of mercenaries 2) The letter of 
thanks of the same meeting to Ex-Governor
terrain do General for his speech against those
contracts with the Kongo-State 3) The protest
of the Commercial Association of Loanda, to which
all the leading firms belong.</p>

<p>These three documents have been largely signed 
by all the whites and natives who are not in the
employ of the government.</p>

<p>I have not the time to translate them; but as
the Department his a translator who knows Portu-
guese I advise that those important documents
the precursors of the declaration of independence
be translated by him and duly noticed</p>

<p>Gringo Andongo
 I also enclose a no. of the Future &amp; Angola
continuing an important article As paiz &amp;
the protest of the municipality of Pengo An-
dongo a large town some 300 miles in the inte-
rior. It is remarkable that four of the 
fire members of the municipal board are
natives and the <unclear/> the Resident, declares that
his wife and children being born Angolans, his
sympathies are with them. The protest of the
municipality though crushed in the most rebellions</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60023.jpg"/>

<p>has <unclear/> was signed by most of the whites of
Pengo Andongo. On sending the protest of the
Loanda papers for publication the president of
the municipality states that of the governor
dissolve the municipality all in ready to <unclear/>
it.</p>

<p>Dondo
Not long ago,the exiled journalist Joao Chagas
(of the Oports Rebellion) was invited to visit Dondo
about 6000 population) &amp; get from the Governor
General the permission to go. On his arrival, the 
municipality went in a body to receive him at
the steamer; a grand reception was given him in
the town, Republican speeches were made and 
a street was given the name of Joao Chagas.
The Governor treatment to dissolve the muni-
cipality, but on learning that it was sure to be
re-elected, he contended himself with suspending
the government "Chefe" for not suppressing that
manifestation. As to Joao Chagas he was sent,
for punishment to the delicious climate of Mos-
sammedes where he continues his propaganda.</p>

<p>Mossamedes
 What happened or was going to happen here
is still somewhat mysterious; but one thing is
known namely that a sargeant &amp; some of the
new immigrants had made a plot to seize <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60024.jpg"/>

<p><unclear/> Governor and make a revolution.
his companions and these were shipped to Portuguese
Guinea.</p>

<p>The annual war with the natives in the interior
of Mossamedes, on the Kunene River has in it appears,
<unclear/> not a failure for the Portuguese, this year. After
an initial success in which more than 6000 <unclear/>
of cattle were <unclear/> from the natives, the Portu-
guese (black) troops have had to withdraw and
have moved in Mossamedes in great disorder.
The Governor General has gone there by last steamer,
in order to investigate the two questions.</p>

<p>Sr. Dantes Baracho, the delegate of the Portuguese
government for the delimitation of the Loanda, who
has been here more than two months doing nothing
was also to go with the Governor but at last <unclear/>
mail a telegram came and he returned ashore 
with his baggage.</p>

<p>People here say that if the Delegate of the Congo
State comes, they will not let the two delegates
go to the interior.</p>

<p>The Spanish <unclear/> of war Isabel II
 Though <unclear/> importance, the following fact has its
significance. The Isabel II has been here for <unclear/>
time, and for a few days had the company of
an English flagship and of a German <unclear/>
After the departure of the latter, the fearing <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60025.jpg"/>

<p>of Loanda gave a grand reception to the Spanish
officers, and , ironically, alas invited the English
The morning only , and no they did. As to the Spaniards
and Portuguese, though they said it was no political
manifestation, they could not help letting "it owe"
as the return-ball offered a brand by the Span-
iards, when one of the officers forgot himself &amp;
added to his <unclear/> for Portugal &amp; Spain, the con
trary for England. The "Isabel II"-sails to day
for the Cape.</p>

<p>Summing up, I wish to state that in
Portugal the general feeling is, that the inde-
pendence of Angola is a thing to rejoice in
rather than anything else, provided the Portug-
guese element remains permanent, and <unclear/>
natives who speak &amp; write Portuguese an not yet
<unclear/>from the Portuguese government has a
twofold object in view, in sending out thousand
of immigrants to Angola: 1) to export the revolu-
tionaries of the word type, and thus to present
an immediate popular attack at home, 2)
to introduce so many Portuguese into Angola,
before, by independence, it opens with it doors
to all nations, and thus seems the predominant
of the Portuguese <unclear/> and tradition as</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_60026.jpg"/>

<p>in Brazil. As in all other things, honor, the
Portuguese government goes against its own interests,
for it sends out men, and so few white women,
there these immigrants are going to raise a lot
of mulattoes who are more offered to Portuguese
rule than the blacks.</p>

<p>A hundred thousand hectors of the best land
on the high and healthy plateau of Caconda
and Bike have been granted to a Portuguese
Company who is to establish there a colony
with the hundreds of important <unclear/>
government.</p>

<p>As to trade with the United States and
opportunities for American capitalists to make
grand stipulations this is one of the most
promising fields. The people have fuel
<unclear/> that for the building up of
a great nation in this land no nation
can be more helpful to them than our
United States who are the model and
ideal appear which they are striving.

at St. Paul de Loanda November 21, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
 Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
In accordance with your instruction
No. 3, of March 19, 1891, I have the honor
to submit to your approval my nomination
of Rev. Lancaster C. Burling, as vice 
Commercial Agent, or as Vice-Consul, at 
this port.</p>

<p>The nominee is an American citizen,
of age, an ordained minister of the M. 
R. Church of America and has been two
years at Loanda, as a missionary con-
nected with Bishop N. Taylor's mission</p>

<p>These facts will, I hope, be considered
sufficient evidence that the candidate
is qualified for the office.</p>

<p>As the Portuguese authorities are so much
inclined to see political agents in all
foreign missionaries, I would have pre-</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70006.jpg"/>

<p>ferred a layman; but, there being no other
American available, I had no choice.</p>

<p>As for my reasons in not re-nominating
Mr. Bannister, the principal one is the 
violent hatred of the Portuguese for all 
Englishmen and all that is English, which
makes it unwise to have an Englishman
represent the United States. Then, according
to Regulations, an American, whom equally 
qualified, is to be preferred to an alien.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, 
 your obedient servant
Heli Chatelain
 U.S. Coml Agent</p>

<p>P.S. The exequatur of my appoint-
ment as Commercial Agent, and that
of Mr. Bannister as Vice-Consul, have
at length come and will be presented
to the Governor General on his return from
the South of the Province.

<p>No. 15
Consulate of the United States,
at St. Paul de Loanda, Nov. 21, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State
 Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
 Whereas we now have a U.S. Board
on Geographic Names, whose duty it is to sim-
plify and rectify geographic nomenclature, both
for official and public use, and
 Whereas the official name given in the U.S.
to this city and Consulate, St. Paul de Loanda,
is neither correct nor practical, and has 
been the cause of many petty <unclear/> ances,</p>

<p>I respectfully submit to the Department
for the consideration of afore-said Board,
and eventual action of Congress rectifying
the official name of this Consulate, the
following reasons for suggesting that 
St. Paul de Loanda be rectified to Loanda.
(1) The native name of this city was at
the time of conquest, and has been to this
day Luanda, in Portuguese spelling</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70010.jpg"/>

<p>Loanda, and pronounced by both natives and
Portuguese: Lwàndà.</p>

<p>(2) Because the place was discovered by the
 Portuguese on St. Paul's day (1407), they
as was their custom called it São Paulo de 
Loanda that is St. Paul de Loanda.
The form San Paolo de Loanda, after seen
on charts and on letters, is half Spanish.</p>

<p>(3) And because the place was reconquered
 from the Dutch on the day of the Virgin's
 Assumption (1648) the name of Loanda
 was enlarged to Sao Paulo de Assum-
cao de Loanda</p>

<p>(4) These cumbersome and highsounding
names were, however, never used by the 
residents of Loanda, whether native or for-
eign; they stuck to the plain Loanda.</p>

<p>(5) The English,-ever poor linguists,-in
dealing with this name, made two blun-
ders: 1. On their charts, in their book, and
every where, they preferred to the popular
and plain, the long winded official, name
 2. Owing probably to a confusion of 
Loanda with Loango, north of the Kongo River,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70011.jpg"/>

<p>they wrote and pronounced, instead of
Loanda, Loando.</p>

<p>(6) Now as in conversation at least,
Englishman and Americans do not care 
for long names, many have taken 
the habit to shorten the name not
by dropping the merely historical St.
Paul and assumption, but by learning
our Loanda, and they call the city
St. Paul's. I fthe word is used
with English speaking people, the question
is which St. Paul's is meant, and
if used with any Portguese or other
foreigner no one recognizes Loanda
in that name. Hence misunderstandings,
losses of letters, and other little troubles.
 (7) The Portuguese and Colonial govern-
ments; all the Portuguese and Angolan 
people; the English, German &amp; French
steamers run to Loanda; the German,
English and other European map
makers; in a word, all those who
have to do with, or know something
about Loanda,-have for several</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70012.jpg"/>

<p>,years past, used this name exclusively
and the old <unclear/> St. Paul de
Loando, yes even the correct St. Paul
de Loanda, must be considered practi-
cally dead, or moribound.</p>

<p>(8) Therefore the U.S. Board on Geo-
 graphic Names, and the U.S. Congress,
 (as for to te title of this Consulate is
 concerned would confer a favor on
 all concerned-Post-Offices, Schools,
 Mariners, travelers, traders, geographers,
 and on the U.S.'S representation as
 this port-if they would give the 
 venerable old term an official home,
 and give their official sanction to the
 use of the genuine and modern,
 though immemorial, name
Loanda.</p>

 <p>No. 17 Consulate of the United States,
 St. Paul de Loanda, Dec. 31, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
 Desiring to inform the Department of various
 occurences, each of which is not important enough
 for a special Report,but may be of some use, es-
 pecially to the editor of the Consular Reports, I
 collect them all in one of miscellaneous
 nears.</p>

<<p>I. Rains, sickness,Plenty Lack of the 
demand for unfree labor. After two years of drought,
the first rains (Sept. to Jan.) have been very copious
and this fact is attended by the three following conce-
quences: (1) With the unusual dampen of the season, from 
fevers and other tropical diseases have increased to an 
alarming extent. Nobody escapes the effects of the <unclear/>;
one by one, all are laid on the sick-bed, some
to rise no more, the great majority to ail on for
some time and then resume their normal state
and usual occupations. I been suffering</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70015.jpg"/>

<p>these two months from a kind of rheumatism and
hand have had two review attacks of fever.</p>

<p>(2) With the drought, the dearth to coming an 
end, and 1892 promises to be a your of plenity.
How great the dearth was, may be inferred from
the fact that large quantities of Brazilian manioc-
meal ("farinha de pas") imported into this land
of manioc and sold for about half of the price of the
best native article, while foreign American corn,
rice and beans successfully competed with these
of the country. One good result of the dearth is that
the natives have learnt to eat bread, and having 
once acquired the habit, are not likely to give it
up with the return of cheap native produce. This en-
larged consumption of bread means an important in-
crease in the importation of American flour.</p>

<p>(3)As soon as the showers soften the soil, the natives 
leave the exacting service of the whites and take
the cultivation of their own fields. This causes
a lack of carriers for the rubber and wax of the
far interior as well as for the coffee of the Cazongo
plantation and a general insufficiency of free
hired laborers for the railroad and all other
work depending on them. This shortening neces-
sarily entails an increased demand for unfree,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70016.jpg"/>

<p>or contract, labor. Within a short time, the prices of 
"servicaes" at Novo Redondo/Novo Redondo) and Benguella,
which are now the principal markets, have risen from 
40 to 70 <unclear/> (one <unclear/>=#1.09) per head, and the
prices may rise to double that amount before long.
The dealers say that the Congo State recruiting agent
offers them 750 <uncear/> per man, and make this a 
plea for <unclear/> up the prices of of course the greater
the profits realized in the business the greater also the
activity developed in procuring the merchandise, that
is in "redeeming" slaves from the interior which is 
simply a revised edition, of the old slave-traffic.</p>

<p>II Political News. The Congo State officer, Mons.
Braconnier, who has taken the place of the unfortu-
nate Vandevelde as recruiting agent of 500 Angola
men for the Congo State army is still here at a ho-
tel waiting for the Portuguese residents to relax their 
opposition to this exportation of unfree labor. The
resistance of the colonists to the home government
in this matter has met with the approval of the whole
colonial and liberal press in Portugal. Some papers even 
go so far as to advise Angola to demand self govern-
ment and prepare its independence. The prospect of 
bankruptcy in Portugal inclines the Portuguese resid-
ents in favor of the native ideal of independence.
Rather separation than shame is the motto of every
Meanwhile here as in Portugal, men of action are</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70017.jpg"/>

<p>not to be found.</p>

<p>Aided by friends and officials, the three principal
rebels of the late insurrection at Oports, have manged
to escape from their exile. One went to Gabon; the 
whereabouts of the two others is known only to the friend
who saw them off.</p>

<p>Senhor Dantos Baracho, the Portuguese Commissioners
for defining the Eastern boundary of Angola with the
Congo State has been here, since August doing nothing but earn
his salary, the total of which is said to amount to
twelve Pounds (60 dollars) per day. Nor is there only
sign or probability of his going to his destination
before next May or June. As his salary is charged 
to the Provincial Treasury the dissatisfaction of the
colonists may be imagined.</p>

<p>Every Portuguese packet continues to bring from
50-60 emigrants sent to the West-Coast by the
Portuguese government in order to deplete the
poisons and get rid of dangerous and starving
tramp. While rational colonization would be 
a blessing to the Province and the home-country,
this kind of assisted emigration is a curse and
a source of endless troubles.</p>

<p>III New Line of Steamers. Nothing proves better
the immense resources and growing prosperity
of the Province then the rapid and steady de-
velopment of steam navigation. While our</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70018.jpg"/>

<p>Philadelphia Board of Trade and enterprising men
of Baltimore and New York have talked for years
about a steam ship line to connect America with
Africa, and have not yet reached the print of sending
a trial steamer, the humble Jewish firm of Ben-
chiniol Lobinho (Lisbon &amp; Loanda) has within
five months bought, repaired and run between Angola,
S. Thomé, Lisbon and Liverpool, four old height
steamers, a far trips of which will suffice to pay 
their cost. Without lowering the freight-charged
by the other company without Government aid, the enterprise 
has proved a grand success.</p>

<p>There is some talk of a third Portuguese Company
running steamers between the same ports.
IV-Vita case. About a year ago, a pupil of
the Baptist Mission at Sau Salvador (in the Congo
District of this Province) called Vita, accidentally
shotone his comrades. He was examined by the
Portuguese Resident (who knows neither English nor
the Kongo language) and sent, a prisoner, to 
Loanda, there to be judged by the competent au-
thority. As, after months of waiting, the mission-
aries heard nothing about the lad, two of them 
came at different times to Loanda to find out
his whereabouts and to have him bought to trial
Mr. Ed. Bannister (then acting British Consul)
did what he could for them, but in vain</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70019.jpg"/>

<p>Hearing of my arrival, the missionaries thought my
popularity might be more successful, and wrote to 
ask my intervention on the lad to behalf. I answered,
that, as the lad was a Portuguese subject I could
do nothing officially, but would use my private <unclear/>
in favor of their protégé. Not only was I immediately 
told where the prisoner was, and allowed to see him,
but the "Delegado" who was to judge the case, and
to whom I explained the particulars, released the
poor fellow witht he statement that the papers 
concerning the case had disappeared. The young
man had been kept eight months in jail without
trial and (forgotten as his case was) might have
rotted away there, had not his missionary protection 
preserved to the end.</p>

<p>V. Stars and stripes in Congo State. On Dec. 8
Rev: J. Chester Hyde, of the American Baptist <uncleaer/>
wrote to me as the nearest consul, since the death
of Lieut Taunt, desiring some information on the
right of flying the Star and Stripes in the Congo 
State. . 2nd Nov.(1891) "says her" Governor General
Walms; returning from the interior, visited me,
I flew the stars and stripes in his honor. The
next day the commissary of our district in-
formed me that only consuls were allowed
to display their national colors beyond the
limits of Matado and I was requested to com</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70020.jpg"/>

<p>ply with the laws. Perhaps you may have some instruc-
tions concerning the stars and stripes. I answered
that (1) the Congo State is outside my consular sphere,
(2) but I would communicate the matter to you, and (3) 
in my private opinion the display of flags is a matter
of country, not of right, but that if,in <unclear/>
circumstances, other nationalities were allowed to
display their colors, an American might expect the 
same privilege.</p>

<p>Complainst against over regulation and taxation,
and in room red-tape in the Congo State as general
<unclear/> traders and missionaries of all nationalities.
VI I have just seen,o n his way home, Mr. Faulkner,
a Canadian missionary, who spent a few years in Ka-
tanga, or Garenganza, as it is known through Fred.
A. Arnot's book. He told me how Mudiri, the 
King of Garnganza, was alarmed when he saw Mr.
Sharpe, the agent of the British South Africa Company
approach his capital from the East, "by the back-door"
as he styled it, and how he absolutely rejected 
proposed British Protectorate and bade Mr. Sharpe
leave his countr at once, as soon as he heard that the
British wanted his copper mines. As is well known,
the Congo State has already conceded all those mines
and the whole of Mushiri's Kingdom to the Belgian
Katanga Company, though no Belgian had ever are
there a foot or get permission from Mushiri to exploit</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70021.jpg"/>

<p>his land and mines. Quite recently the Belgian
expedition of said Company and the Congo State
have been at Mushiri's capital and may have 
been more fortunate than Mr. Sharpe.

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
 According to ar 503 Consular Reg-
ulations, the oath required for Form No. 101
is to be taken before a person having authority
to administer oaths</p>

<p>As appears from enclosed note of Mr.
Bannister and my remarks which follows,
the practice of this Consulate on this point
has not been according to the letter either
of Par. 503 or of Portuguese law. To settle
my samples and those of any honest Con-
sular officer in Portuguese Possessions this 
point oght to be definitely regulated by the
Department.</p>

<p>For my first oath to form no. 101, I 
was governed by the practice of the Consulate.
Closer study and reflection made me doubt
its legality and I went for the second with,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_70025.jpg"/>

<p>to notary public, "tabillias". He refused
to administer the oath, stating that he was not
authorized to do so by law. In order to settle 
this point and find out whether any other 
functionary could perform that office, I called
on a judge who knows English and is the 
highest authority in the Province on question of
laws, and I laid the question before him.</p>

<p>His answer was that the Portuguese law
recognizes only two kinds of oaths: (1) the 
oath of office of public functionaries, administrated 
by a judge (2) the judicial oath, administered
by the judge in court. Any other oath is not
legal, and any functionary administering it 
makes himself liable to prosecution. The signed
declaration of a party is as binding as an oath could
be and the only thing a notary public can do
is to legalize the signature, thus prosecuting doubts
as to the genuineness of the signature.</p>

<p>Trusting the Department will either sanc-
tion the course hitherto pursued at this Consulate
or clearly state how that oath is to be taken 
in the future, I have the honor to be, Sir
Your obedient servant

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
Since New-Year the political condition
has remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Every by-weekly steamer continues to
bring some 20-50 <unclear/> and criminals
sent by the Portuguese government to colonize
West Africa. Many die, a few manage
to go home at the expense of charitable people
or captains, the rest setlles down to work, and
tries to make a living.</p>

<p>The telegraphic news, about middle of
January, of the change of government in 
Portugal has quisted the spirits and given 
new hopes to the democratic patriots
The present minister of Colonies, his secretary
and the secretary of the Minister of Foreign
affairs are almost Loanda-people, having
been here so long and two of the being married</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_80001.jpg"/>

<p>to white natives of this city.</p>

<p>In order to get over her financial crisis,
Portugal must find money somewhere, and 
the pawning or the selling of some of her Col-
onies is inevitable. I know from personal
friends in ruling circles from the conversation
of the people, and pigment hints of the frees
of all colors, France or Germany would be strongly
objected to by the people., the pawning or sale of
Macao, or the Agries, or the Cape-Verde
Islands or Kabinda (near mouth of Congo),
all strategic points of unsupposable im-
portance for our navy and our commerce
of the future, to the United States, would 
be viewed with favor, you hailed with joy,
by the majority of the people.</p>

<p>I can't help drawing again the attention
of the Deaprtment even at the risk of ap-
pearing impertinent, to this unique chance
of securing one, a few, or all of those
splendid ports.</p>

<p>Subject:
Official relations between this Consulate
 and the Province of S. Thomé</p>


<p>Abstract of Contents.
(1) Though comprised within this Consular
district, the Province of S. Thome has never
had any official relation with this Consulate.
(2) It seems desirable that, when appointed
the U.S. Consul at Loanda be also introd-
ced, by the Portuguese government to the
Governor of S. Thome.
(3) For complete statistics and better 
reports the Consulate ought to receive
the Official Bulleting of S. Thome, as
it already receives that of Angola.</p>

<p>No. 23 Consulate of the United States,
at Loanda, March 25, 1892.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
 The Islands of S. Thome (St. Thomas)
and Principe (Prince's Isld.), comprised
within my consular district, form a separate
Province, with a Governor of its own, and with
an Official Bulletin, in which all official
communications and statistics of S. Thomé
are published.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the U.S. Consul at
Loanda, when appointed and approved, is
introduced by the Portuguese government
to the Governor of Angola alone, and not to
that of S. Thomé, nor has the Official 
Bulletin of S. Thome inc been sent to
this Consulate.</p>

<p>As the Islands of S. Thomé and Principe
are by their large plantations of coffee,
cocoa and other tropical produce constantly</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_80004.jpg"/>

<p>growing in commercial importance and promise
to haveconsiderable trade relations with the
United States as soon as the means of
communications improve and the production
of either country be made known, it seems
desirable that the incumbent of this Consular
post be officially introduced, by the Portuguese
government, to the Governor of S. Thomé, and
that the Official Bulletin of S. Thomé be
sent to this Consulate as that of Angola al-
ready is.</p>

<p>I therefore suggest to the Deartment
the advisability of requesting those two
favors of the Portuguese government.

<p>U.S. Consulate 
Loanda, April 12, 1892</p>

<p>F.O. St. Clair, Esquire 
Chief of Conslar Bureau
Washington,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
On the receipt of your letter
dated February 16, 1892, I at once wrote to
the missionary in charge at Gabon requesting
him to give me the information you desire
concerning the U.S property at that post.</p>

<p>Pending his answer, I hasten to give 
you what I already know on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham C. Campbell; whom
you mention as having the last, on June 30, 1886,
drawn for salary as U.S. Commercial Agent
at Gabon, has been since then in the
States and is not expected to return to Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph H. Reading, who sent,</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800008.jpg"/>

<p>in February 1887, the last communication you
received from Gabon, has also been in the
States, for some four years past, and will probably
stay there. He published in 1890 as Philadelphia
a description of the West-Coast entitled "The
Ogowe Ban" and was then residing in a 
small town of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Through a Gabon missionary who <unclear/>
on me here about two months ago, I know that
at that time the U.S. coat of arms was still
hung out at the American Presbyterian Mission
house of Baraka near Libreville, the capital 
of the "French Congo"; for this is now the <unclear/>
native of the former Colony of Gabon.</p>

<p>Probably all the Consular archives are
there intact as left by Mr. Reading, the
mission station having been <unclear/>
occupied since his departure.</p>

<p>It is well <unclear/> decided that, owing 
to the prohibition to teach in any but the <unclear/>
language, all the American Presbyterian
Mission Station in French territory that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800009.jpg"/>

<p>be passed over to the Paris Evangelical Mission-
ary Society who has a young work in that region.</p>

<p>The efforts of the American Presbyterian
Mission (North) will then be chiefly directed
to the southern and inland portion of the German
Protectorate of Kameroun, where there is greater 
liberty. The flourishing station of Corisco and
Benita will no doubt be kept up as long as 
Spain allows them to develop peacefully.</p>

<p>As to the expediency of continuing or
discontinuing that consular post, allow me to
suggest that unless they be disinterested
philanthropist, consular officers from America
at $1000.00 in a deadly climate like that
of Tropical Africa, will not in fact can not-
be of a quality to honour their country or 
to give satisfaction to the Department of State.
They will never stay long enough in their dis-
tricts to form an intelligent opinion of their
state and resources, or obtain reliable in-
formation of any sort.</p>

<p>In the present state of Africa, the Dep-
artment of State <unclear/>. Consuls who are or
promise to become, authorities on African questions</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800010.jpg"/>

<p>where and is of greater weight then the accounts
published in daily papers, who ar determined to
make a serious study of their districts, and who
are able to condense the results of their investigations
into readable reports. Such Americans cannot be ex-
pected to spend or sacrifice their lives in tropical 
Africa for $1000.00per annum.</p>

<p>Any one acquainted with modern Africa, who
peruse our Consular reports on this great Continent
South of the Sahara and north of the Cape, must be
struck witht he sad inefficiency of our Consular
in that region, and must realize the need of a 
complete reorganization of that service of it is
do practice to the United State not only morally, com-
mercially and industrially, but on the highest <unclear/>
politically.</p>

<p>Unless our government's adhesion to the
Brussel's Act is to be an empty form, it behoves
the United State to be kept posted by its own agents
on the real state of slavery and slave-trade in
Africa and this cannot be without our Consular
system in said region entailing a new phase.</p>

Angola.

<p>Sir:
Having often had occasion to notice

Loanda, Africa, June 28, 1892.</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir: 
Since my dispatch no. 20, dated February
13, 1892, no material changes have taken place
in the political and commercial situation of this 
Province. Still some events may be of interest
to the Department.</p>

<p>Evasion of the Oports Rebels: Most of the
common soldiers who took part int he Oports Rebellion
of January 31, 1891, and who had been exiled to
this Province and that of S. Thomé have been 
pardoned in the early part of this year and have
returned to Portugal. Of the chiefs of the rebellion
only one is till here, and for the simple reason
that he has no desire at all to Loanda.
All the other leaders of the Rebellion have contrived
to escape to France. One embarked at Mossamedes
on a sailing vessel bound for Gabon and reached 
his destination without difficulty. The Director of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800016.jpg"/>

<p>the Amstrm-House at Mossamedes was censured and
the "Official Bulletin" for conniving with the evasion,
but was not otherwise punished. Two other leading
rebels were at Loanda, put in boxes and embarked on frail
steamer bound for the North. At Ambrig, However,
sea-sickness caused by the usual <unclear/> of
that coast compelled one of the secret passengers
to open the wicket of his box, and led to the discovery,
of the two fugitives. The captain of the steamer had 
them bound with chains and delivered them to the
Portuguese authorities of Ambrig, they were accompanied
to the ofrt by a detachment of soldiers and by a chasing
crowd who hailed in them the matrys of the Republic
after a few days of banqueting with their Republican
friends of Ambrig and recieving 300 dollars embarked
in a far houses by all the leading traders, the rebels 
again escaped on a sailing-vessel bound for Gabon,
where they met their comrade from Mossamedes
and whence all embarked for France. After 
leadng men of Ambrig were arrested and brought
to Loanda in a man of war; but is the whole po-
pulation of Ambrig had openly taken <unlcear/> in the e-
vasion, and the population of Loanda too was favoring
it, the men were again sent home unmolested.
A fourth leader of the Rebellion escaped in the same</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800017.jpg"/>

<p>manner-with the secret assistance of Republican gov-
ernment officials from Principe (Prince's Island) and the accomplices were more seemingly
presented.</p>

<p>Public feeling. The public opinion of Angola which for
a time leaned strongly towards separation from the metaphors;
ceased agitating this question, when the Dias Ferreira ministry
took the helm of government, because many hoped it would
by a coup d'etat "establish" the Republic. Then the tariff
question called public attention to another side, and now 
the presiding feeling is one of discouragement. "Everything
is lost; Portugal is dead" is now a frequent expression.</p>

<p>Commercial situation and the new tariff. The main provisions
of the new tariff are: (1) Most duties are charged according to the
weight of the merchandise (2) Portuguese goods are free or
well-nigh so (3) All foreign imports pay much higher duties,
(4) The duty in foreign alcohol is prohibition, (5) The Governor
has no longer the ferver to exempt any goods from paying
duties, (6) The Kongo District, which enjoyed free-trade
is now, by an agreement between Portugal and the Kongo
State, subjected to a tariff more moderate than that
of the Kongo State. This new tariff does not interfere
much with American imports: machines continue to be free,
kerosene and flour are necessities and Portugal can not
compete in them, and timber pays little more than <unclear/>
as to the general effect of the new tariff, everybody is now
argues that it was mistake, that its only result will
be a rise in the prices of all necessities, and hence
of labor, and the final desertion of these markets by</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800018.jpg"/>

<p>the native trade of this far interior (rubber-trade)
which will prefer the Kongo-route. Of all events,
Angola which had enjoyed unusual prosperity during
the terrible crisis of Portugal is beginning to loss confi-
dence since the new tariff has come, credit is being
withheld and the air is full of fear for the future</p>

<p>Railroad extension. On the 17th of may fulfil the section of the Loanda
railroad was opened to the public. The daily up and 
down trains run now over 220 kilometres. The territories,
Cassoalalae, is on the Lucalla river, near Dondo. The
coffee district of Cazengo, which is the main object of
the railroad, is not yet reached, but every new section
of 20 kilometres will already left the planters to bring
their coffee to the territories of river navigation. The <unclear/>
rates are still to high to compete with the river boats
or to induce the native trader of the interior to make 
of the railroad. Most of the Angolan natives, to, prefer to walk
over the track rather than pay the fare. The railroad
as far as opened, is still far from paying, but the govern-
ment guarantees the interest on all the capital <unclear/>
spent by the company on the road. This is the reason
why the company does not care to increase either the
passengers or the freight traffic; which could easily be 
done by a general reduction. Poorly built and <unclear/>
as this railroad is, it is a decided blessing to the countries
and is sure to pay a good dividend when the coffee
region is fully tapped, that is in three to six years</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800019.jpg"/>

<p>The new trek of Boers. When, last year, the Boers of
Humpeta, in the district of Mossamedes, helped the
Portuguese government to subdue Bihe, they were so
pleased with that cool and <unclear/> high plateau
that they wrote to the Transvaal inviting their contingence,
to come and join them. Now this near trek of Boers, estimated 
at about 200 <unclear/> is daily expected in the south.
The Portuguese government has sent there the officer who
knows best how to deal with he Boers, having married
one of their daughters, and the people and government
hope he will be able to settle the new corners without
conflict. Hitherto the colony of Boers has been a State
within the State, jealously maintaining their own religion,
customs, administration, language race. They elect their
own commandants, carefully and intermarriage with the Portu-
guese, and only go to war for the Portuguese government
when the latter agrees to pay them what they ask. Nor,
have they ever paid taxes. If, on the arrival of the new
trek, the Boers should decide to found a new Republic,
there is no military power in Angola that could prevent it;
and if the Portuguese government should try to subject the
Boers to the common administration, there is no doubt but
that it would hasten the formation of a Boer-State.</p>

<p>It does not talk a prophet to foresee the loss of Portugal
of the highlands of Bihe, Gangda and Ambriola, and
the formation in the near future of a State which European
statesmen never dreamt of, when they partitioned Africa</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800020.jpg"/>

<p>King Mushidi of Katanga shot According to a letter
from Captain Stairs to a missionary in Bihe, King 
Mushidi of Katanga (Garngaza) was shot by an
officer of Stairs, as he was ordering his soldiers to
fire on the approaching column of Stairs' expedition
I already informed the Department of how Mushidi he
coolly rejected the British Protectorate offered him by Mr.
Sharpe of the South Africa Company. It appears he was
going to do the same with the expedition of the Kongo
State; bu the latter felt strong enough to fight, and
so made short work with the King's resistance. <unclear/>
to Stairs' expedition, the King had kindly "recieved the
Kongo-State expedition under Lieut. Le Marinal, whom
I had the pleasure of meeting in Loanda on his
way to Europe. Though Le Marinal, missionaries on 
the spot, and nation just come from there, I learn that
the country between Kasangi (Cassange) and <unclear/>
at the confluence of the Lulua and Kassai, is in state of anarchy
The Kongo-State has destroyed the town of their <unclear/>
prisitgé. Mukonog Kalamba, King of the Bashilanga
and the Makok slave-riders are carrying as 
many humn herds as they can manage, to be sold
as slaves to the middle men who bring the survivors
to the coast, where they are "redeemed" as contract
laborers.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have to acknowledge the receipt
of your instructions No. 12, dated
March 5, 1892, no. 13, dated April
6, 1892, and of your circulars dated
January 21, 30, February 2, 10, 15, 24,
26, and March 6, 9,7, 19,16, which have had
due attention.</p>

<p>I also have to thank the Depart-
ment for sending out new seals and 
furniture for the circular office, which
have reached me in due course
of time. Unfortunately the panes
of the book-case were broken, one because
the weight of the glass had loosened
the wooden list holding inside and which
was not sufficiently <unclear/>, the other
because a board which had been nailed</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800022.jpg"/>

<p>inside got loose.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Governor General used
kindly to exempt Consular effects from
paying duty, but with the new tariff
he is no longer allowed to that, as
all the imports of the government are
now subjected to the common tariff.
 Therefore teh two last shipments above
mentioned had to be pay 20% ad
valorem, which however was not put 
too high.</p>

<p>Washington, D.C., A pril 15, 1892</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
At the request of several gentleman in the Consular service
we have recently examine with care the "Revised Tariff of Official
Fees" as prescribed by Section 598 of the Regulations of 1888, and
have reached the conclusion that several of the items therein speci-
fied are erroneously and illegally classed as "official fees." If we
are correct in our view of the law these fees are personal emoluments
of the Consul and need not be accounted for to the Government. Our
attention was first especially directed to the fee for administering
the oath to emigrants for the free admission of their animals,
vehicles, and personal effects (Form 93), under the Act of 1883,
(Par. 677), but in the examination of the question we found it neces-
sary to consider the whole subject of official and unofficial fees,
and we soon became convinced that under the Regulations many fees 
were accounted for which in reality belonged to the officer.</p>

<p>We are preparing, in connection with the fir of which ex-Sen-
ator Omar D. Conger, of Michigan, is a member, to bring a series of
suits in the United States Courts to test these various questions, 
and would be glad to act for you. If you will authorize us so to do,
by signing the annexed letter of authority, which need not be 
acknowledged, we will examine your accounts in the Department and
advise you as to what particular fees we think we can recover for you.</p>

<p>We will not, in any event, use your case as a test one, and un-
less the Courts sustain our position, we will not even file your 
claim but will return the power of attorney to you.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800024.jpg"/>

<p>We will undertake these cases upon a purely contingent fee and
will not call upon you for any contribution, even towards expenses.
In view of this we think a fee of 33 1/3 per cent. of the amount recov-
ered would be reasonable.</p>

<p>It will give us pleasure, if you desire it, to furnish you with
special references as to our professional standing, etc., but refer
generally to the Columbia National Bank and the Washington Loan and
Trust Company.</p>

<p>Very respectfully,
 Jones &amp; Voorhees.</p>

<p>P.S.--If the enclosed proposition is acceptable to you, please
your reply give us the dates of your consular service, continuous
or otherwise. We wold also esteem it a favor if you would give us
the name of your predecessor and his address, if known to you.</p>

<p>Equator, Congo State, April 27, 1892</p>

<p>There is an edict soon to be issued restraining all other 
than State flags except in martial waters. The Dutch,
French &amp; English flags are not allowed nor inland
of Matadi and at stations on The Upper Kongo, except
when the State flag is given preference at the top.</p>

<p>The French authorities interdict the use of the
state flag on steamers starting from the French side
Even canons without State flags cannot pass Equator
station &amp; a Dutch steamer was fired on for trying 
to thus pas Bangalla.</p>

<p>As for the Belgian flag, it accompanies the
state flag on the Upper Kongo steamers, but is not
allowed on Buildings of the Railroad above Matadi.</p>

<p>I may give you some of my observations during

<p>No. 29 Consulate of the United States,
Loanda, June 29 1892</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
 Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
For the reasons enumerated below
I take the liberty to request the De-
partment to grant me a furlough to
the United States, for the maximum
time allowable and to begin as soon 
as suitable to me in the early part
of 1893.</p>

<p>(1) Angola offers at the present time
one of the most promising fields for
American enterprise. Simple Consular
reports are not sufficient to induce American
capitalists to invest money in a country
so far and unkown. It requires personal 
conversation and to organize commercial
undertaking. The first condition of im-
portant commercial relation between</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800032.jpg"/>

<p>America and Africa is the presence in
Africa of reliable American firms. When 
once set a-nothing the ball will soon be-
become an avalanche. Mr. Hart, of the Geo.
Squir Mfetg.Co. Buffalo, N.Y., has
been here a few weeks, and has already form
The Loanda District alone, orders for more
than $20.000 of agricultural machinery and
the promise much more in the near
future. On similar and other lives, American
firms and individuals could do as well and
better, of will represented on the shot.
Tow German commercial travelers who can-
vassed Angola a year ago got orders for
about $200.000 and since then German
imports are seriously competing with the
English.</p>

<p>(2) The Consular reports from this field
 shall not suffer bymy furlough, as
 by correspondence with my friends here and
 by the papers of the Province, I shall be
 as well informed in America, and able
 to supplement any information in greater
 detail.</p>

<p>(3) The Chicago Congress on African ethnology</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_800033.jpg"/>

<p>in connection with the Expedition_the publication
of my large work on Angolan ethnology, especially
on folk-lore, which is the most important contri-
bution to that branch of science ever yet written,
and which is sure to give haste to the above-
mentioned Congress_and various other scientific
meetings, associations and publications will be 
greatly benefits by my presence, even for a
short time, in America.</p>

<p>(4) Last, but not least, my physical consti-
tution will, by that time need the bracing
influence of a more temperate climate, and
my heart and mind some relief from constant
&amp; close contact with <unclear/> and corruption of
all sorts.</p>

<p>Trusting my request will be granted,
 I am, Sir,

<p>No. 31 Consulate of the United States,
Loanda, June 29, 1892</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
Six weeks ago a partner of Newton,
 Carnegie &amp; Co. showed me in clipping from 
 an English paper a Washington telegram
 <unclear/> that Congress had for the current
 fiscal year reduced the income of this
 Consulate, as that of other minor ones in
 Africa, to the fees.</p>

<p>At the same time I was advised 
not to be such a fool as to stayin Loanda
spending money for a government that ceased 
to support me.</p>

<p>There being a probability of retrenchment
in the budget of this Congress, I some-
what expected that my salary would be
stopped after the June quarter, and realizing
the impossibility of my continuing long to
Consul without any support; was awaiting</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90002.jpg"/>

<p>the official announcement of the reduction, in
order to tender my resignation, and shut up
this Consular officer-for without remuneration
as English-speaking person would take is. 
As however, the official advice of the con-
tailment has not yet come, nor do American
papers confirm that news, I have begun to
doubt its correctness.</p>

<p>Still, as this question has set me a-then
King, I have come to the conclusion that,
whether the salary be continued or not, its 
would only be just; in presence of familiar 
circumstances of this port, of the Department
would assume the expense of office-rent,
not to exceed 7 dollars per month. This 
is the request I now respectfully submit
to your decision.</p>

<p>Considering further the fact, that I a
not engaged in business and give all my 
time to the collection and distribution of non-
paying, yet highly useful, information n
this vast Consular district, an appropriate
increase of salary, whcih would per se settle
the office question, would appear yet more
just, and ensure the better standing of this
past.

in Portugal, I have the honor to

<p>Extract no. 1
From the "Seculo" of Lisbon</p>

<p>Translation
 Independence of Angola.
 The newspaper of the important
 colony are again concerned about
 the state of the Province and
 the negligence with which it is
 treated by the government of the
 metropolis. One of them, thus
 finishes are editorial on this
 subject.</p>

<p>Set therefore, the unanimous
and <unclear/> cry of all be
 "the independence of Angola"
In another article, the following may be read
"This cannot, nor shall it, continue. The
government is secretly selling the colonies
and we do not want to be English. Therefore,
the only alternative left us is to proclaim
the independence (autonomy) of the Province,
imploring the protection of the United States
of North-America. This, as is well known</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90007.jpg"/>

<p>would not be difficult; it will be done
the day we want it.It is, however,
to be lamented, that good and loyal Portuguese,
who long for the greatness of their country, and
love their native land, be forced by their 
ill-omened government to co-operate in
the disintegration of the father land."</p>

<p>In another article, mentioning an
injustice committed in S. Thomé, one
roads:"It becomes necessary for us
to change our minds, far from the present
regimen we can expect nothing but injustice
and contempt."</p>

<p>Thus it is that the government by
its favorition and that of its delgates
is estranging the sympathies of the colonies
and pushing them to revolt.
When the thing is done, it will be too late
to repent.</p>

<p>Translation of marked Passage
 "It is one more competent
 &amp; authorisation voice, &amp; demonstrate
 the lack of wisdom with which the
 central government legislate, as a
 rule, for the colonies, and to prove 
 the absolute necessity of granting
 to some of them their administration
 autonomy.</p>

<p>The idea of autonomy has acquired,
 in these last times, a great prominence
"in the minds of these who love their
country with genuine enthusiasm.
By granting autonomy to Angola,
Portugal would reap the enormous
advantages:</p>

<p>(1)The reduction of defeat in
 the colonial budget
 (2) The refund increase of the
 indirect receipts by the development
 of commerce.</p>

<p>The Portuguese government has</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90010.jpg"/>

<p>already admitted the advisibility of self-
government, by turning our the administration
of certain pacts of East-Africa and chartered
companies. But circumstances will force
it to carry out this principle more effica-
ciously, if it will not <unclear/> the risk
of losing, sooner or later, its sovereignty,</p>

<p>P.S. the "Correio de Portugal " of Lisbon,
(devoted to colonial questions) thus begins its
editorial of July 6:"One of the gravest
symptoms is the cry of independence which
is being heard in almost all the colonies.
The Azores, Madeira, S. Thomé and An-
gola already openly raise the banner of
revolt and of annexation to the United States
of America; and in East-Africa, where the
Portuguese element is "scanty"; there is no
dislike of becoming part of the proposed
Federation of South-African States." And
the disaffection towards Portugal goes
on to show that it is justified.</p>

<p>I may add that again and again whites and
 natives say to me, or in my hearing: "Why don't
 the United States try to get us.2"</p>

<p>Honorable Wm. F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State,
 Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I am sorry to have to inform you of
Mr. Ed. Bannister's irregular conduct in
various matters:</p>

<p>(1) In the settlement of Judson's estates
he kept some money (about $100.-) which
I already mentioned in a previous dispatch,
and which I doubt he ever paid to the
Treasury; and he refused to return to me
some papers he had asked of me for said
settlement.</p>

<p>(2) Unbeknown to me he corresponded
 as U.S. Vice-Consul with the Chicago Exhibition,
 bought and sent to them a native cause and
 machila, telling the people at Loanda that
 my appointment as Commercial Agent did
 not interfere with his as Vice-Consul.
 (3) I hear that since my departure</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_90020.jpg"/>

<p>and the closing of the Consulate officially
made known in the government's official 
Bulletin for Angola, he still claim to be
and signs himself as U.S. Vice-Consul.
(4) This is the more reprehensible as Mr.
Bannister is acting British Consul at
Loanda and appointed British Consul for
the Kongo Free State.</p>

<p>It might be well for the Department
to stop Mr. Bannister's unlawful use 
of said title by informing the public of
Angola through the Governor and the Official
Bulletin that Mr. Bannister has no
right to act as, or call himself, U.S.
Vice-Consul.
