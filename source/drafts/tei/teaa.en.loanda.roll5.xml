<p>Sir:
        In reply to your letter of this

<p>To Henry F. Downing, Esq.
     U.S. Consul,
        St. Paul de Loanda,</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th
            inst., with refinance to your Consular drafts; the
            reason we object to your drafts, is that we have
            no business with America, and pay commission for
            collecting and remitting to England, costs
            us a considerable amount, and such drafts
            are of little use to us as a remittance in a 
            commercial way.</p>

<p>         If you could give us drafts on
            England, we should be happy to take <unclear/>
            at par and think the movement will have
            no difficulty in this, having agents in London.
                <unclear/> are dear Sir,
                    Yours truly,
                        Newton, Carnegie & Co.</p>

<p>Con H.L. Rives,
     Assistant Secrtary of State
        Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to submit
    to the Department the following:
        The desire of our people to 
    intend this foreign trade is inducing
    them to look towards this and adjoining 
    parts of Africa as a possible field
    for cultivation. If this is true, it is well
    for them to know that while it is by 
    no means impossible for them to secure
    a valuable market here, there are many
    obstaclces to overcome, the greatest of which
    is inexperience but an examination
    of the methods of other countries will
    teach them much.
        The commercial nations of 
    Europe recognizing that the success
                                    of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0008.jpg"/>

<p>of endeavor in these parts depended
   upon a knowledge of its people, adopted
    a system the wisdom of which is paved
    by their large and successful dealings,
    and, if our peopleact upon the the belief
    that they can conduct their <unclear/>
    under different rules, they are making
    a mistake which will cost them dear,
    for costly experiment will only prove
    the value of England.and Germany's
    methods.</p>
    
<p>     An internale knowleddge of the
    people, their wants and their habits in
    a necessity, this is to be had only by
    contact and American resident represen
    tatives of houses, learning the dialects <unclear/>
    is of first importance; for often, the 
    purchase of produce, ddoes not so much
    defend upon the quality of the goods,
    as it does upon the the <unclear/> of the
    trades.</p>

<p>     As all or any of their habits
    may be of value as guides to a study
    of their character. I have taken this 
    method of describing a few of those
                                customs.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0009.jpg"/>

<p>customs which are more or less general.</p>

<p>     That part of this country
    which is on the coast live and between
    Lat. 5º South, and Lat. 15º 20… South
    contains some twenty different tribes.
    Then again are divided and subdiversed
    and, while in some respects are alike that
    are many points of <unclear/>.</p>

<p>     When referring to the habits
    and customs of these natives, attention
    is drawn to the question of slavery; but
    as practiced by them, it takes a com=
    plexion so mild that it crries with it
    amongst them, no hardships. Their laws
    make it a necessity for the owner to
    give them every care, attend to them where
    sick, food and clothethem, bury and marry
    and happiness in every direction, and so
    little difference is made, that the owners
    in speaking of their slaves, call them,
    son or daughter.</p>

<p>     The peaceful dispositions
    of these coast tribe prevents war from
    beign a <unclear/> for the ranks of
                                slavery</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0010.jpg"/>

<p>slavery, but these are found through
    the workings of their laws, which are
    strict, a plentitude of victims. Offices
    against property are causes for slavery or
    death, any one caught stealing <unclear/>
    be he who he may, chief or subject, the
    property of the one stolen from the most
    trivial things; for instance, spitting on
    another shoe, is looked upon as a heinous
    crime deserving of death or slavery.</p>

<p>     The source from which flows
    the greatest supply is their superstitions.
    Witchcraft is their only belief and all
    crises of accident or misfortune are
    <unclear/> to it. Sickness, death, failure
    of crops are all reasons for consultation
    with a "fetish" man, who, <unclear/> a
    victim changes him with being the course.
    The accused, and often his family, are
    either killed or sold into slavery yet
    they have the right to appeal to trial
    by ordeal. </p>

<p>     Trial with these people is
    an ordeal by poison.This custom is 
    not particular to Angola but, is 
                            common</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0011.jpg"/>

<p>common to the whole West African
   Coast for I have seen the same super
   stitution displayed with slight changes,
   in Liberia and on the Gold Coast. As
   the "modus operandi" of of applying the
   test may be found interesting, I will
   attempt to describe it.</p>

<p>     The poison used in this <unclear/>
   performance is prepared by pulverizing its
   powder the hand, thick bark of a tree
   which the natives call "sani-wood"
   the powder so made, is then dissolved
   in hot water and is taken by the indi=
   vidual in <unclear/> all and frequent doeses.
   unti it acts. It expresses itself either
   as an emetic, meaning innocence, or
   as a laxative, meaningguilt, or causes
   causes a cessation of the pulsation
   of the heart and death.</p>

<p>     The scene surrounding the
    preparation of this poison, called "casca"
    are horrid beyond the powers of description,
    and when seen by one, who in a sense,
    is a descendant of thesepeople such
    thoughts spring to being as suggests grati-
                                    tude</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0012.jpg"/>

<p>tude for causes which have made me 
   what i am.</p>

<p>     THe victim being found, the
   act begins; "fetish"men and assistants,
   with old and toothless hags adjourn
   to the depths of the forestwhere in 
   a place so formed by nature that it
   echos will multiply their howlings,
   they choose a spot and "fetish" it as suited
   to their incaulations. In a central posi-
   tion a mortar containing a pestle is
   sunk into the ground when the head
   "fetish" man, mute and with stealthy
    motions, take a position alongsidethe
    mortar, with his assistants and the 
    old hags forming, a circle around him
    and thus, in immovable silence, they
    remain until the gloom of might
    descends to land, assistance to the
    horns of the scene. Then animation
    takes the place of quiet and, the <unclear/>
    of the forest is polluted by the <unclear/>
    aeal howlings of the savage cries, <unclear/>
    circles of fires spring to life, having
    for a central figure the head "fetish"</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0013.jpg"/>

<p>"fetish" man and the mortar, between
    each of the fires are displayed their
    grotesque idols "fetishes" and "charms," and
    the making of "casca" is commenced.</p>

<p>     The head "fetish" man putting
    a piece of the bark in the mortar gives it
    a blow with pestle.This example is
    followed and repeated by his assistants
    ,and the old <unclear/>. As night 
    grows old action becomes more violent
    until the savages in, drunken, and
    delirious frenzy discard their cloths and
    brutal in their superstition, moisten the
    fatal mixture with blood flowing from
    self inflicted wounds.</p>

<p>     Blood painted savages naked
    in maddened, dance, amongst many
    fires, whose lurid flames, accents
    the forests gloom where echoes in answer
    to the howlings of the yelling throng
    find fitting accompaniment in the
    roaring of the beasts of the woods.
    The flitting bat, and mournful
    cry of the owl, with the moon
    sending her light between the 
                        exchanging</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0014.jpg"/>

<p>exchanging branches of the trees,
   to cast fantastic shadows over all
   farm a scene worthy of "Dante's Inferno."</p>

<p>     The victim, in the meantime,
   has been made the solitary occupant
   of his hut where, during the long
   hours of night, he has been forced
   to listen to the scoldings and threaten-
   ings of the women of his town, who 
   surround it. This is no light inflic-
   tion for many of them have vivid
   imaginations and are celebrated 
   for their descriptions of the powers
   of "fetish."</p>

<p>     The hottest hour of the 
   following day being the time ap-
   pointed for the application of the
   test, the subject is then taken to
   a place which has been "prepared."
   A path, fully exposed to the rays
   of the sun, at both ends of which
   are vesels containing "casca" and 
   lined on both sides with natives,
   young and old, male and female,
armed with all sorts of weapons</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0015.jpg"/>

<p>is a course on which he is to run
   back and forth until the fetish,
   which is given to him alternating at
   each end of the course, works.</p>

<p>     In running he has his 
   advocate, who <unclear/> him with a 
   bunch of palm leaves in his hand
   and encouraging him in these words
   "run, run, run, do not stumble, do not
   fall, you are innocent and "fetish" can-
   not catch you," at the same time he
   is closely pursued by a native holding
   a naked sword, who shouts "fetish"
   pursues you, confess, confess, you are
   guilty and must die." If in running
   he should stumble or fall he is at
   once and with great cruelty killed
   by those that line the path but
   if enduring fatigue, the poison
   asserts itself as an emetic, he is
   declared innocent. if as a laxitive,
   guilty; and either dies or is sold into
   slaver.</p>

<p>     Every town has King
   but he has very little power as it 
                                is</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0016.jpg"/>

<p>is all in the hands of a council com=
   posed of the old men. The crown is
   hereditary bet because of the un=
   certainty of paternity, the natural
   sequence of their understanding of the
   laws of morality it descends to the 
   child of the sister of the King</p>

<p>     When a civilized travellers
   arrives at a native town he is re=
   ceived with ceremony and treated
   kindly. Before entering a town he
   addresses its king of his desire to visit
   him, and after receiving permission
   it is well for to forward
   his compliments to King and council
   by a bottle of rum as well as by
   sending a few glass beads to the
   King's wives after entering the town
   he is at once escoted to a large
   enclosure when he finds the King
   and all his subjects, salutes are
   then given and returned, by clarifying
   the hands in a peculiar manner
   followed by a welcome in words
   replied to in like manner by the
                           traveller.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0017.jpg"/>

<p>traveller, who, after making the
   King apresent or "dash" of cloth
   and rum, is conducted to a hut
   where he finds food and a bath
   already prepared for himas well
   as one of the maidens of the town
   to act as his handmaiden. When
   the time arrives for the traveller to
   take his departure another general
   meeting and more presents the
   King, in return recieving a sheep
   or goat. Bidding farewell to 
   to the King and council some of the
   young men, warriors, conduct
   him a short distance and then 
   leave him free to pursue his journey.</p>

<p>     Theres is no ceremony of
   marriage except mutual consent.
   The man has to make a large
   present to his wife's family and
   on the n ight when his wife is
   delivered, give a "fatuka" or dance.
   If he fails to supply his wife
   who comes to him naked, with
   clothing and house keeping ap=
                           pliances</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0018.jpg"/>

<p>pliances, it becomes her right to
   return to her fathers house.</p>

<p>     Women give birth to children
   with the greatest ease. At one time
   I had occasion to want some rice
   flour, I directed a woman to pre=
   pare it and after putting her to work,
   went away, becoming occupied I
   forgot it. After a few hours I was
   reminded of the want and went
   to find out what caused the delay.
   I discovered teh same woman singing,
   and busily working at the mortar,
   and when I asked why it was not
   finished, received this reply; "<unclear/>
   I been go bush liffa make do some
   ting," at the same time lifting
   from the ground and showing me
   a new born baby.</p>

<p>     The methods of burial are 
   more compliated.The body im=
   mediately after death is put into
   a shallow hole whic has been
   dug in the floor of the hut in 
   which it died. It is then covered
                                with</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0019.jpg"/>

<p>with a thin layer of earth, even which
   fires are kept burning until the body
   becomes hardened. It is then taken 
   out and stretched on a frame and
   suspended over fires until it became
   smoke dried, after which it is stood
   in one of the corners of the hut
   where it remains, one of the family
   for years before final burial.</p>

<p>     The belief of the natives in
   "fetish" engenders a general fear of
   one another, causing them to indulge
   in many strange and amusing prac=
   tices. Hospitality makes it necessary
   that the guest be provided with "need
   and meat." This omittedoffense is given
   and an appeal is made to"fetish." It
   sometimes happens that the unexpected
   visitor finds the <unclear/> empty but
   the host, equal to the occasion,
   sends and borrows a "lent rat,"
   which is a common field rat which 
   is then covered with a paste made
   of mandirea meal and haudled
                            to</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0020.jpg"/>

<p>to the guest, who, careful not to
   touch the meat eats the meal this
   is continued until his hunger is
   satisfied when the rat is returned
   to the owner. The guest has been
   entertained with "meal and meat"
   and the host is relived from any
   fear of "fetish."</p>

<p>     Time being of no value to
   these people they will when <unclear/>
   a market for their products travel
   miles for a difference of a few
   beads or a yard of cloth, or to
   find a trader known to them. I
   remember when I was trading
   in Liberia, that in Bantu for
   a quantity of produce, I gave
   with other goods, a lot of powder
   some two months afterward the
   native who had received these
   goods returned bringing with 
   him all he had recieved, and
   complained that one of the kegs
   powder was light in weight.
   Examination showed that it</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0021.jpg"/>

<p>wanted about 1/2 of a pound the
   mistake corrected he went away
   satisfied. so to recover a value 
   of about twenty cents, he, with
   some twenty carriers, had spent 
   at least six weeks on the road.</p>

<p>     A peculiarity is their
   dislike to trade with strangers.
   They prefer to take less from
   or be cheated by traders when 
   they know and who are familiar 
   with their habits. This prejudice
   is overcome only by contact
   and learning their ways.</p>

<p>     The customs and habits
   as before described are more or
   less common, to Angola and the
   whole of the West Coast. There are
   many more, local in their nature,
   that, or which, may be subject
   matter for future dispatches.</p>

<p>Sir:
            I have the honor to inform

   it is impossible under present arrangment
   for me to live upon the salary allowed

   of a physician and in many directions 
   a departure from that strict economy
   which might bring expenses within that
   amount allowed is the effect of an
   African climate where to this is added
   the expense of providing for a family
   in the U.S., it will be seen that by
   assuming this position at an early
   date. I am not only just to myself
   but am acting towards my government
                                 with</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0024.jpg"/>

<p>with frankness and with dependence
   upon its justice.</p>

<p>         The importance of this Consulate
   is such as is derived from the cultiavation
   of African trade. Cape Coast the daily
   growing in importance, Lagos, Benny, at the
   mouth of the Niger with many other points,
   are valuable; but Monrovia, Gabon and
   this place areand politically and commercial
   ly the important points on this coast.</p>

<p>         Those districts, which are
   watered by the Congo and its affluents,
   since the establishmentof the "Congo Free
   State" by Mr Stanley, under the protection
   of the Belgian Government have gained
   a value in the age of the commercial
   world <unclear/> to no other part of the
   coast. The effect of this has naturally
   given to Loanda, because of its geographi
   cal position an impetus expressing
   itself in many directions: for instance,
   railroads, water works etc.</p>

<p>         Given these facts, it will be
   concided that, as a factor to advance
   our foreign trade it is necessary that
                                       it</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0025.jpg"/>

<p>it should be cultivated in this direction.
   While as a means towards this end a
   Consulate here is of significance, the 
   first consideration should be the Consul.</p>

<p>       When the interests of our country
   are placed in the hands of a trader, they
   must suffer, more particularly in a district
   such as this, where his whole duty is such
   as relate to the advance of our foreign
   trade.</p>

<p>        A trading Consul not only is
   at times prejudiced in jdugement and
   dependent in action, but he also often
   finds occasion to make the performance
   of public duty give way to private inter=
   ests.</p>

<p>        Induced by these opinions I 
   have desired to keep myself in that 
   position which would cause me to think
   through influence and independence to
   protect and advance the interests of
   American trade and to protect American
   citizens in their property but I have
   failed and I find that unless
                                    some</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0026.jpg"/>

<p>some way is found for supplementing my
   income. I cannot remain here.</p>

<p>         This being the case I would
   respectfully ask from the Department
   its favorable decision in its consideration
   of either of the following requests: Virg,
   1º: A recommendation to his Excellency the
        Presidentfor my transfer to Liberia
        as Consul General (see papers on file
        in Dept.),
   2º Leave to visit the United States for
        the purpose of forming such business
        connections as will permit me to
        remain in charge of this Consulate
    3º Leave to return to the United 
       State for the purpose of tendering
       my resignation.</p>

<p>         I regret that necessity
   forces me into this position but i have
   no option. It is better for me to "grasp
   my mettle," than it is to seen the
   risk fo <unclear/> my government
   as I am sorry to say, has here
   and before by United States
   Consuls here laboring under the same</p>

<p>Sir:
            I have the honor to inform
   the Department, an expedition of
   th land and sea forces under the command
   of Senor Joan Antonio de Buisac das 
   Neves Ferreira Captain of the Frigates Gov.
   of COngo have taken military occupation
   in the name of the King of Portugal
   of a tract of land north of Loanda
   and Ambrig. in the neighborhood of
   parallel 7º S and known as Ambrigette.</p>

<p>         'Tho the strong natural
   limit of Angola i.e., as regards climate
   fauna and ethnology is from the Congo
   River to Cape <unclear/>, yet the country occupied
   by the Portugese, until this later addition
   was only from Ambrigto <unclear/>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0030.jpg"/>

<p>         The natives inhabiting this
   part of the coast are called "<unclear/>"
   The natural effect of the slave trade was
   to encourage thm into indolence but
   since all hope of it being again establish-
   ed has passed away the development of
   produce in the district and from the
   interior has been great, and premises
   to become much of greater and very important
   in amount</p>

<p>        At present most of the 
   produce comes from the interior. The system
   of trade differs from that of other points
   and is complicated and curious. All 
   produce-except ivory-<unclear/> being brought
   to the trader is weighed and price
   argued in English "<unclear/> in Portugese
   "<unclear/>". This "<unclear/>" or "<unclear/> is the unit
   of exchange to which all articles of
   barter are referenced: for instance, good
   blue glass beads; a 4ds common cotton
   cloth ; etc. are equal to a "<unclear/>" or "<unclear/>
   articles of greater value are more long
   each.</p>

<p>                Being <unclear/> to allow
                                        the</p>

<p>the natives to enter the factories. the buyer
   gives the seller a paper witht he number of "<unclear/>
   or "<unclear/> written on it. which the holder
   presents a window of the store when he receives
   its value in goods. It can be imagined what
   shouting and noise there must be when <unclear/>
   are gathered before one under each clamoring
   to be paid first but practice has enabled
   the trader to become an expert in the hardship
   these people that the chattering chords  seem
   to melt away</p>

<p>         The principal rpoducts are coffee,
   peanuts, fibre, <unclear/> seed, red gum <unclear/>
   white angola gum india-rubber , palm kernals,
   palm oil and <unclear/></p>

<p>         Several menial deposits
   of more or less value, are <unclear/> the
   most important/are, one of mineral pitch
   and another of malaohite but the natives,
   through fear of annexation, have made 
   these deposits "fetish" and as they are
   reached via the beautiful Ambrigette
   river unfortunately navigable only by
   canoes the natives allow no white men
   to go furhter towards its source than
                                       a</p>

<p>         This expression of the policy of
   the Portugese is in accord with their many
   efforts to promote the interests of the province
   giving them an added influence in the 
   Congo and making Angola more interesting
   to the commercial world.</p>

<p>Translation</p>

<p>The most Illustrious and Excellent for:</p>

<p>         I have the honor to announce to your
   Excellency, the in obedience to orders, I arrived
   at this place on the 22nd of the current month,
   between the hours of 10 and 11 in the morning
   and after seeing that the forces had their mid-
   day meal, all other things being in readiness I
   gave the necessary order to disembark which operation
   commenced at 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>         Knowing the harbor because of former visits,
   I allowed the Bart "Cabinda" to near the shore, while,
   "the Steamer" Massabe," having been ordered to 
   follow in sailing order in the rear, did not
   arrive until later when during the calm hours 
   of night, she took the "Cabinda" in tow and <unclear/>
   her seven miles to the point of disembaration.</p>

<p>         Disembarking my forces, I sent in the
   fisrt boat the Resident with some workers and
   native servants with instructions to care for boats
   as they arrived: Having done this I next sent ashore
   by squadrons the 1st platoon of a Company of..
   infantry, giving ashore myself I caused the
   troops to occupy at quick step, a commanding
   position on an elevation to the south of a village,
   which rested on the edge of a swamp, and to
   the rear of the English factory of Hatton & <unclear/></p>

<p>         The other platoon of infantry having lauded
   by squadrons, the artillery supplied with one 
   section of camp equipments and baggage.
   This disembarkation was compelled during the
                                           night</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_0034.jpg"/>

<p>night and happily wihtout loss, for in order to
   prevent accidents I detailed a few sailors as a 
   rescuecorps and to assist in landing. Simultaneous
   ly with the disembarking I switched the <unclear/>
   of the troops and the posting of the necessary 
   sentries for the night.</p>

<p>            The following morning I planted a mast
   brought from "Cabinda" for the purpose, then amidst
   the sounds of trumpets; the beating of drums; the
   military salutes of the of the infantry the national salute
   from the artillery and from the vessels of the <unclear/>
   gay in a holdiay array of flays, I raised and
   gave to the breeze the national emblem of our country.
   and declared, in the presence of Becoa de Roi and
   other native princes summoned by me to be present,
   that I took possession of the country in the name
   of Portugal's King; but that our intentions were
   amicable and meant no wrong to them yet
   a continuation of the kindness depended upon 
   the future actions. Attempting to <unclear/>.
   they said that our flag could not be dsiplayed
   without the permission of their monarch for
   reply, I told them that I did not summon
   them for the purpose of asking permission from
   their King, but as witness to my act, and
   that it mattered not whether permission was
   given or not. These natives before taking their
   departure mentioned a time for returning where
   at a conference they would advise me as to
   their King's decision, On the 26th they returned
   and informed me that their king had decided
   to accept what he could not prevent .</p>

<p>             No disturbance has bee caused business
   having been carried on as <unclear/> at the factories
   so that, I can report, without answering for

<p>To the President,
    Your Excellency:
                Although it is the
   good fortune of the negroes in the United
   States to be brought under the influence
   of a people whose example is leading
   them towards higher levels, a knowledge
   of the peculiar conditions which sur-
   rounds their history, prevents teh suppo=
   sition that it is possible for them, at 
   this early date, to have reached that
   situation where they can, as a <unclear/>,
   be independent of <unclear/> reasons
   for endeavor.</p>

<p>             This being allowed
  it becomes easy for me, without prejud=
  cing myself to enter into a relation
  of circumstances surrounding my present
  situation, from which I desire to be
  relieved.
                    The</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10005.jpg"/>

<p>             The public value which attach=
   es to a Consulate is derived from many
   sources, at some the duties are almost
   only clerical,at others they become
   judicial, at others diplomatic and,
   so on until we touch that <unclear/>
   that find great, and important work in
   laboring for the augmentation of our
   foreign trade and this last mentioned
   <unclear/> is divided by the difference which
   is bewteen Consulates engaged in the en=
   largement of trade relations already
   established and those whose duty it
   is to open up new trade connections. The
   opening up of new trade does not apply
   only to those places where commercial=
   ready exists, but also to those places
   having a possible future commercial value.</p>

<p>                That our growing industries
   are finding new outlets in West Africa
   the evidence of our exports, proves, but
   these markets are open to improving cul=
   tiation and under the case of Consuls
   who are American Citizens, able, because
                            compensated.</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10006.jpg"/>

<p>compensated, to confine themselves to
   the performance of the duties of their
   office, their value would soon be ex=
   pressed in the most happy results.</p>

<p>             Opposed to a Consul endang=
   ering his official usefulness and weakening
   his influence or placing himself in a 
   position preventing indpendent and 
   unprejudiced action by being engaged
   in business, I took charge of this Con=
   sulate with the hope of being able to 
   live upon my salary but now after 
   and in spite of every economy. I
   find that it is impossible, and unless
   I can secure a larger income it will
   be necessary for me to leave this service
   of my country.</p>

<p>             Recognizing an extended
   field on this coast for the expressions
   of such intelligent action as would
   benefit our commercial interests, I
   am anxious to remain. Familiar with
   the commerce of my own country, its
   industries and manufactures, I am
   confident, if opportunity is given
                                  me</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10007.jpg"/>

<p>me to utilize the knowledge which
   I have of Africa, its people and its 
   trade, that I will be able to do
   something towards, adding to our
   foreign trade.</p>

<p>             Because of the reasons as
   before stated, I respectfully ask to
   be transferred to Liberia as Consul
   General and I hope your Excellency,
   that this request will met with your
   approbation and induce favorable
   action in the premises.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be,

   to me from St. Thomé with enclosed letter,
   (enclosure no. 2) upon finishing it improperly

<p>     The general behavior Mr-

<p>We have all kinds of advantages of the

   here-such for instance, as paying his bills
   with <unclear/> drafts-headed "U.S. Consulate"
   which gave his victims the impression that
   what said drafts-promised national value
   with our government- Some of these drafts
   or one of them at least has given for more

<p>Mr. Downing took away with him

<p>        <unclear/> I have no form

<p>The Honorable
    Q.L. Rives
     Assistant Secretary of State
      Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
        I have to inform the department
   that as Mr. Henry F. Downing failed
   record his official correspondence
   in the dispatch book I am unable 
   to number my dispatches and I
   consequently leav ethem un numbered
   until the numbering is correctly
   adjusted by the department.</p>

<p>     Since the receipt of the Consulat
   regulations from the department, I
   have learned that the Consulate is,
   with the exception of the archives
   (an inventory of which I foward
   herewith) wholly without the proper
   legal belongings of the office</p>

<p>     As I informed the departmet in 
   my communication of the 15th ultimo
   all belongings of this Consulate were
   seized by Mr. Henry F. Downings
   creditors, between the 15th and 30th of 
   last March while he was in transit 
   to America and before I assumed
   the duites of the office.</p>

<p>     After presenting my credentials to
                                       the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10031.jpg"/>

<p>the Governor General of the province
   I requests his interference in 
   relation to the delivery of the 
   Consular effects into my hands and
   his advice to me was to the effect
   that I hsould pay the indebtedness
   and take charge as he had no grounds 
   for interference considering the fact
   that Mr. Downing had led his creditors
   to believe that the United States were
   responsible for his debts and doings
   out here.</p>

<p>Having no other alternative I
   went so far as to redeem the
   archives, as the whole affair was
   beign ery disgracefully talked about
   and knowing also that the state
   archives were not for the hands
   and eyes for the outside world.
   For the redemption of the archives
   I paid one hundred and forty seven
   dollars and sixty eight cents $147.68.</p>

<p>    I have also ordered for the
   Consulate four (4) chairs, one ordinary
   table, one large receptacle for archives
   to protect them from insects which
   are very destructive here until the
   department furnishes something
   better. I have also ordered a 
                    flag staff</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_10032.jpg"/>

<p>flag staff to be erected, the cost
   of which is 116 mil reis or 
   $125.28. I have an old flag of
   my own which I will use until
   the department furnishes me with
   another more appropriate.</p>

<p> The deparmtent will please also
   furnish me with stationary and
   office furniture as it cannot be
   purchased here as cheaply as in
   the United States transportation
   and all considered.</p>

<p> I desire to have a boat
   also, if the department will be
   good enough to supply one as it
   costs over $1.50 for the hire of 
   a boat every time I visit a ship.</p>

<p> I drew on the treasury in last
   month for $20 a draft in favor
   of John Hass but not having any
   regualtions I find it was improperly
   made out but from the nature of 
   the circumstances I cannot but
   hope that it was honored never-
   the-less.</p>

             to be Sir

<p>Sir:
        I have the honro to
   acknowledge the receipt of departments
   dispatch dated June 15th as well as a 
   printed paper, "instructions to 
Consular Officer on leave."</p>

<p>     Referring to said dispatch,
   I would report that I left my
   Consular district on the 5th of
   April, 1888. As regards the terms
   of agreement between Mr. Judson
   and myself. they are in effect, to
   allow me to draw all that may
   be due the Consulate until such
   time as I may return to my post.
   for this Mr. Judson has already received
   an equivalent. The rules contained
                                   in</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20004.jpg"/>

<p>in above mentioned instructions to 
   Consular Officers on leave here, today,
   for the first time come under my
   notice. Therefore, having no knowledge 
   of any rule which made it necessary to have
   a written agreement, to be furnished in
   duplicate. i have failed unfortunately, to
   provide one and are force to ask the De-
   partment to accept  statement as a 
   fact.</p>

<p>     I, having received no intimation
   from the Department; that it had acted
   favorably on my recommendation of
   Mr. Baines as Vice Consul, although his
   Bond was forwarded at the same time
   as my dispatch recommending his appoint
   ment-, I thought it achievable to not
   leave Mr. Baines in charge, and await
   an expression from the Department
   relative to his appointment as prema-
   nent Vice Consul.</p>

<p>Hon. Q.L. Rives
    Assistant Secretary of State
     Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
            Referring to certain changes
   contained in dispatch of acting Vice
   Consul Julius L. Judson of St. Paul
   de Loanda dated May 16, 1888. i have 
   the honor to inform the Department,
   that Loanda on the 17th of
   March I arrived at Cabinda on the
   19th of the same month where I found
   Mr. Judson and delivered to him the
   Consular Seal and Stamp with in-
   structions to proceed immediately to
   Loanda, but not to assume the duties
   of his office until the 31st, when 
   I would be learning St. Homé, the
   Northern land of the Consular district
   which place I desired to visit for
                                   the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20006.jpg"/>

<p>the purpose of gathering information
   which might be of commercial value.</p>

<p> It is true that I returned to 
   Mr. Judson his bond. My motive for
   doing this was not so much that it
   was not properly made out but
   that, having no knowledge of the 
   sureties named in the instrument,
   I was not satisfied as to their respon-
   sibility, and I judged that by 
   making it necessary for him to 
   provide another, he would be forced 
   to have it certified to by some of
   the Portugese authorities and therby
   give reason to believe in its value.</p>

<p> Against the charges as to my 
   general behavior while in Loanda, I
   do not know how to defend myself,
   unless they are specified, but will 
   say, that cohersion any action of more
   as U.S. Consul at Loand, has been
   subject matter for criticism, i have
   to learn.</p>

<p> 1st So far from being able
   to take advantage of the "confidence
                                   not</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20007.jpg"/>

<p>not to say ignorance of the
   Portugese" for instance, by "paying
   my bills with bogus drafts." I found
   it impossible to get them to accept
   good, honest government drafts, for,
   with one exception, viz. Messrs Newton-
   Carnegie & Co. There was no house
   doing business in Loanda that
   would handle an U.S. Consular
   draft of any kind, and furthermore,
   A Mr. Judson's statements are to
   be considered, value should be given
   to that part of his dispatch which
   I have quote, "It is thought here
   that the smallness of the salary,
   is the reason that U.S. Consuls
   sent here generally resort to finan-
   cial treachery and intrigue and 
   almsot invariably leave in disgrace."
   If this has been the experience of 
   the Portugese in Loanda with U.
   S. Consuls it is would seem that
   They must be fond of having
   Theier confidence and ignorance
   again and agian taken advantage
                                of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20008.jpg"/>

<p>of.</p>

<p>     To my knowledge there has
   been no business done by me with
   paper, except with the well informed
   houses of Newton, Carnegie & Co. and
   Baines, Larent & Co. and neither of
   these houses are Portugese.</p>

<p>     Reforming to te statement
   that on his arrival at Loanda, he
   found that my creditors had seized
   everything belonging to the Consulate
   I would respectfuly inform the De-
   partment that in accordance with
   arrangement entered into between
   me, Baines Laurent ¶ CO and my creditors,
   Messrs Baines, Laurent & Co. retreived
   me from all other creditors but them
   selves, by taking upon their house
   my debts and the seizure, I think,
   will resolve itself in a matter of
   an owner taking possession of 
   what he was authorized by me 
   to take. This is explained as follows:
   I had certain furniture from
   a dealer, for household use, for
                                which</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20009.jpg"/>

<p>which I was to pay 40 mil
   reis per month to protect him-
   self. <unclear/>, the owner just
   before my departure furnished 
   me with are <unclear/> bill of
   sale and requested me to attch-
   a note to <unclear/> stating in set
   terms that the property was his,
   and that he was authorized
   to remove some at such time
   as best suited his convenience.
   This I did, and I <unclear/> that
   Mr. Judson was cognizant of
   this arrangement for he, with
   me,called upon Mr. <unclear/> and 
   arranged with his debtor to carry
   the contract over on the same
   terms. Mr. Judosn at the same 
   time called with me on the owner 
   of the house where was located
   the Consular office, and <unclear/>
   to continue any lease. Therefore,
   that this property was taken away
   may be true, but, that the property
                                    of</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20010.jpg"/>

<p>of the United States was seized
   I fancy a statement that should be
   viewed with suspicion, particularly
   that part which refers to the action
   of his Excellency the Governor Gener-
   al, i.e., in refusing to take cognizance
   of the matter. From my knowledge
   of this Portugese gentleman, I think
   that he is too careful and well 
   informed an official to subject
   himself to reprimand or recall,
   by encouraging an infraction
   of the Treaty between the U.S. and
   Portugal. Furthermore, how could
   my "victims" be led to belived
   that the U.S. Government would
   be any more responsible for my
   debts of Consuls who preceeded
   me. If this view of the case is
   accepted, it will seem that 
   the payment of my debts, means the
   purchase of household furniture
   by Mr. Judson, for his personal use.</p>

<p>             I would respectfully
                                inform</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20011.jpg"/>

<p>inform the Department that
   one copy of Consular instructions
   of 1888 as well as all correspondence
   properly <unclear/> and filed away,
   as well as furniture soemwhat in
   excus of what is allowed is or 
   should be at the office of the
   Consulate.</p>

<p>         Referring again to Mr.
   Judson's statement, that he has
   no Consular instruction no forms,
   no products or anything I would
   say that Mr. Judson was a guest
   at my home there fore quite
   two weeks when I tried to educate
   himinto the duties of the office,
   and it sums quite a coincidence,
   that he could so happily name
   the right acct, "miscellaneous
   expenses." for his draft in <unclear/>
   of Mr. Hass of Lisbon.</p>

<p>           Mr. Edmund A. Baines
   may not be in Loanda but he 
   is then in Cabinda where Mr. 
   Judson resided, but, Mr. Baines
                            should</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20012.jpg"/>

<p>should be in Loanda no later than 
   August.</p>

<p>         In connection with the
   above, should respectfully submit
   the enclosed letter from Mr. Judson
   to me which I find, bears the same
   date as his dispatch to the Department.</p>

<p>         Knowing nothing of the Rev.
   Mr. Judson, from others, that can 
   reflect unfavorably, upon his
   character, I have confined myself
   to facts.</p>

<p>         I have the honor to be,
             Sir,
              Your obedient servant,

<p>Consulate of the United States
    of America at St. Paul de Loanda
        June 30, 1888</p>

<p>To the Honorable
    Q.L. Rives
     Assistant Secretary of State
      Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
        I beg leave to make the following-
   statement to the department viz
   I have been for several weeks very sick
   with rheumatic fever, have had the doctor 
   nearly every day for the past three weeks-
   Most of the <unclear/> and Consular Correspon-
   dence for this quarter I have had to arrange
   while in bed suffering most excruciating
   pains, and only getting a little help oc-
   casionally when visited by an English friend
   Mr. Downing's disgraceful career here has also
   induced if very hard for me as I can
   find no one here willing to honor a draft
   on the U.S. government. I have consequently
   exhausted all the means I brought to Loanda and
   have drawn on all the ready money I had in
   Cabinda to meet the expenses of this quarter, today 
   nothing of my own doctors bill and medicine.
   The disorder from whcih I am suffering is very
   prevalent here and seems to beyond the power
   of the Portugese doctors.</p>

<p>     I have the honor <unclear/> to beg the department to
   excuse this paper and that upon which most
   of my returns are made as it was impossible to
   procure other of the proper page. All the Consular
   visiting material being still in the hands of Mr.
   Downing's creditors. I promise the department
                                            that</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20014.jpg"/> 

<p>that as soon as I am furnished with proper forms and
   instructions small endeavors to render my accounts
   as neatly and as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>I note theGovernor General a second time con-
   cerning the Consular effects held by Mr. Downing's
   creditors referring him to the treaty between the U.S.
   and Portugal, he immediately advised me to <unclear/>
   legal proceedings in the local courts for their recovery.
   This will of course entail expenses which 
   have no authority to make, which expenses may 
   amount to several times the value of the 
   effects in question, please advise me as to this.</p>

<p>         Mr. Downing carried with him
    all the forms for making out drafts except two
   or three which he had partially spoiled-
   Consequently of mine made out on unofficial
   paper as I could do no better notwithstanding
   this, I hope you will honor or pay them, if you
   dont, and force me to wait until I can get
   forms, etc. I will starve here in Loanda-
   Mr. Newton the English Vice Consul and former
   U.S. Vice Consul returned here a few days since from
   Madura where he has gone for his health and tomeet
   his wife upon his ascertaining that Mr. Downing had
   also defrauded him off a large amount, he told me
   that he misleaded to let the next Consul sent here
   starve as they moved all have done had he not
   cared for them</p>

<p>         I write this by in bed on board the Portugese
        mail steamer on route for Cabinda wehre i will remain
        three or four days to see if I shall not get better,
        of course I would not dare forward the department
          such a mutilated dispatch under ordinary cirucmstances
        but I have not walked in a month begging your leaving
                            I have the honor to be

<p>Hon. Q.L. Ries,
    Asst. Secretary of State
     Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to inform 
   the Department that i hereby tender  
   my resignation, to take date fro the 
   receipt of this of the office of U.S.
   Consul at St. Paul de Loanda,
   Africa.</p>

<p>     Explanation of this my
   action is found in teh fact that the
   compensation of the office is such as
   will force any one into many em-
   barrassments. This has, unfortunately,
   been my experience both in Africa and
   at home.</p>

<p>     After having been incumbent
   of this office for longer than a year, I
                                        find</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20020.jpg"/>

<p>find that I am compelled to resign
   not only deeply in debt but actually
   without means and with no prospect
   of immediate employment.</p>

<p>     The poignancy of my sorrow is
   added to when I remember that the 
   difficulties surrounding my situation
   does not alone touch me but, threatens
   also my wife and children.</p>

<p>     Praying that my resignation
   will be accepted and thanking the
   Department for its patience and
   great consideration.</p>

<p>Hon. Q.L. Rives
    Asst. Secretary of State.
     Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
        I have the honor to acknowledge
   the receipt of Department's dispatch dated
   the 2d inst.</p>

<p>     I would respectfully advise
   that deprived of opportunity, because of
   distance to secure information, I have no
   connections to make as to statement of 
   facts as therein mentioned, but I
   regret that it was not in the power
   of the Department to assume the posi
   tion i now takes before I had now further
   compelled myself to the government
   in a precurring way since my arrival
   in the United States. I have been allow-
   ed and paid $170.00. acct. salary, also
   under instructions from the Treasury 
                            Department</p>
<pb facs="ViewScan_20023.jpg"/>

<p>Department I on the 2d inst. disposed
   of a draft on the Secretary of the Treasury 
   at 15d/s for $65.1 17/100 residue of salary.
   This latter draft I am able to and will
   withdraw. Referring to other drafts
   drawn by me I understand that
   with the exception of two they have 
   all been paid. These two that were
   returned unpaid I have recovered
   and have satisfied teh parties who
   held them. Viz <unclear/> Dan Lolway
   <unclear/> & Co. of New York and Joseph Laylor.
   of Brooklyn in the amount as per
   their face value. THie relieves the
   Department from the necessity of considerings them.</p>

<p>     In recommending the 
   removal fo Robt. L. Newton Esq. as
   U.S. Consul at St. Paul de Loanda
   I had in view only the performance
   of my duty as an U.S. Consul i.e, as
   far as it touched the cultlivation of
   our foreign trade. A vast market teeming
   with fast developing riches offering
   prizes to commercial enterprise, I
                                found</p>

<p>found, on my arrival at Loanda,
   monopolized by European nations. I 
   saw with envious jealousy the vessels
   of England. Germany, Holland and 
   other European countries emptying that
   fertile land of its products and their
   ciiezens growing wealthy through
   well directed efforts of their Consuls
   not the least active of whom was
   H.B. M's COnsul Robt. L. Newton Esq.
   knowing that at one time America
   had been building up a trade there
   growing in importance every day but
   had now died. I believed it would 
   be wise to find the reason for its
   decline. On examination I found
   that the withdrawing of American
   bottoms from the African trade during
   our domestic troubles while interrupting
   did not destroy our commercial prestige
   in that direction for our exports to 
   Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cape 
   Town are still making gratifing
   advance yet Angola, a province
   written the valuable district of 
                                the</p>

<pb facs="ViewScan_20025.jpg"/>

<p>the Congo with its principal city 
   Loanda had been gradually
   eliminated from a condition of use-
   fulness to our industries until now
   commercial intervene is nil and
   the situation is suc as allows the
   mercantile house of Newton, Carnegie
   & Co. to inform the Department through
   me that <unclear/> is no paying <unclear/>
   for the introduction of American goods
   there, and this in the face of the fact
   that England finds there a rowing
   and paying market for, not only
   her wares, but can dispose of in large
   quantities, of petroleum orginally
   bought from us. Correspondence with
   other and disinterested merchants avised
   me that only a want of knowledge
   of American products prevented their use
   I therefore had reason to think that
   the competition between nations, which
   is finding an opportunity to express
   itself so positively in Africa, hindered
   a Commercial Agent of the most, ag-
   gressive, commercially, nation of the
                                    world.</p>
