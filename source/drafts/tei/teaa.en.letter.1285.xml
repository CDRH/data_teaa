<p>Mr. James Robert Spurgeon,
to

U.S. Pensioner's mail robbed.</p>

<p>No. 46, Consular Series.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia May 14, 1900.</p>

<p>Honorable David J. Hill,
Asst. Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to inform
you that the mail from Mr. S. L.
Wilson United States Pension Agent
at Washington, containing checks
from the Treasury Department
and vouchers for Pensioners
in Liberia has been repeatedly
tampered with from time to time.
Sometimes Pensioners would
receive the envelope contianing
the voucher but the check
would be missing. During
the Past two months there has
been repeated inquiries as to
the reason of Pensioners not
having received any returns
at all from the Pension Agent.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3091.jpg"/>

<p>It appears now that we have
a clue to the matter. An
under clerk in the local post
office is suspected and he has
left for parts as yet unknown.
We do not know to what <unclear></unclear>
this robbery of the mail has
gone on but of the pensioners
Isaac Ketter, certificate 54,773
and Julius C. Taylor 909,720
certificate appear to be the
known loosers. They
employed attorneys and
instituted an investigation.
The result is they are on the
track of parties who have
been seen with the checks.</p>

<p>I would suggest that in
the future all mail from
the department at Washington
containing drafts or checks
or Treasury notes be registered
and sealed officially. There is
great regard here for a letter
impressed with the U.S. seal.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, sir,
your obedient servant,
James Rob't Spurgeon
Charge.</p>
