<p>No. 24.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,<lb/>
Republic of Liberia</p>

<p>J. Milton Turner<lb/>
to the<lb/>
Department of State,<lb/>
Washington;<lb/>
U.S.A.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Reporting carelessness of Hon. G. D. Moore; with reference to safety of Archives.</p>

<p>Inclosures:</p>

<p>No. 1. Mr. Moore to Legation<lb/>
 " 2. Legation to Mr. Moore.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-1126.jpg"/>

<p>No. 24.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, May 1st 1877.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit for the information of the Department the accompanying inclosures showing the correspondence between the undersigned and Mr. Gabriel David Moore, ex Vice Consul General of the United States. That the absolute neglect with which Mr. Moore treated these Archives while entrusted to his official care, may be perfectly apparent to the Department. I will ship to Washington, a box containing twelve valuable books which he 
<catchwords>allowed</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon. John L. Cadwalader<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington U.S.A.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-1127.jpg"/>

allowed the "white ants" to destroy: His neglect must have arisen from indifference. <sic>Borne</sic> in the country, Mr. Moore must have knowledge of the necessity to keep books and papers in Africa well dusted and exposed to the air; which is a simple duty easily performed. The former incumbents as well as the present one of this official post, have kept the Archives of this Legation free from destructive insects; It seems therefore certain that except for positive carelessness the late Vice-Consul General could have done the same. This destruction <sic>befel</sic> the portion of the Archives referred to, between the nineteenth of December, when I am satisfied the German Consul delivered them in safe condition into the possession of Mr. Moore, and my return here from
<catchwords>leave</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-1128.jpg"/>

leave of absence: Had my return been deferred twenty days longer, the destruction of the Archives would have been complete. In view of the nature of the circumstances described; the undersigned does not hesitate to request the Department to decline to cancel the bond of Mr. Moore, until remuneration is made by him for the damage caused. The long delay in naming a gentleman to be Vice Consul General, continuing as it did until the Department's instruction to have that officer named reached the Consul General at this point, was occasioned by the extreme difficulty with which one must meet here in the endeavor to select a person in all respects worthy to fill so important a trust: It is a great satisfaction that the remainder
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

of the Archives are in safe condition.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir:<lb/>
With high consideration and esteem,<lb/>
Your Obedient servant<lb/>

<note>Enclosure No. 1.</note>

<p>Monrovia, April 28th 1877.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to confirm my verbal notice to you, by tendering this as my resignation of the office of United States Vice Consul General at this place, to take effect from date hereof.</p>

<p>I have also to request the return, as soon as practicable, of the bond filed by me on entering upon said office, or a certificate of the cancellation thereof.</p>

<note>Enclosure No. 2.</note>

<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia 1 May 1877.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Under date the twenty-eighth ultimo., I received your note purporting to confirm your verbally expressed desire to resign the office of Vice Consul General of the United States at Monrovia: In that note you also request- "the return, as soon as practicable, of the bond filed by me– you– on entering upon said office, or a certificate thereof." In reply, I have to say: perhaps, I should have, handed you official information prior to this with reference to the condition in which you are 
<catchwords>regarded,</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honorable<lb/>
G. D. Moore, Monrovia.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-1133.jpg"/>

regarded, in relation to that office by the Government of the United States.</p> 

<p>However, in view of the fact that you handed to me upon my return to Monrovia, the Department's despatch No. 10. informing me that the nomination of another gentleman to fill that office had been approved by the Department of State, I have proceeded from the predicate that such information from me to you was altogether unnecessary.</p>

<p>With regard to your request for <sic>cancelation</sic> of the bond <sic>refered</sic> to, I have to say: if I had received from your possession, the Archives of this Legation and Consulate General in a safe condition, which you know from our verbal <catchwords>communications</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-1134.jpg"/>

communications and joint examination was not the case, the return to you of that bond, or the certificate of the cancellation thereof, is a matter fixed by statutory law to be and remain so completely within the purview of the Government at Washington, that in that as in the present case, it would be my duty to refer your request to the Department of State at Washington: which I assure you shall be done at my earliest practicable <sic>oppertunity</sic>.</p>

<p>I am,<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
(signed) J Milton Turner</p>
