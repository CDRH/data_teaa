<ab>Consulate of the United States
at Bathurst 11th August 1859</ab>

<p>Sir;
I have the honor to en-
-close herewith The Secretary No.1
Return of Arrivals + Departures
of American vessels for the Quarter
ending the 30th of June last
also the Quarterly Return of No.2
Fees for the lame period amount-
ing to sixty two dollars and fifty 
six cents.</p>
    
<p>You will also find here-  No.3
-with a copy of the Treaty between
France and England relative 
to Portendia and Albreda, and the 
free navigation of the Gambia, con-
ceded to France by the latter pow-
er.</p>

<p>I have indirectly learned
that Her Majesty's Government
has sent a Despatch to the <unclear></unclear></p>
    
<ab>Honorable Lewis Cap
Secretary of State of the United States
Washington</ab>
    
<pb facs="20170616_095442"/>   
    
<p>Acting Governor of the settlement
the Contents of which are to this 
purpose, that, the House Govern-
ment experienced many difficul-
ties in regard to the right of 
free navigation of the Gambia 
accorded to the French, form which the 
Powers with whom England has
treaties with the "most favored
nation" Lause; that it could be 
agreeable to the House Govern-
ment to have the opening of the 
river to the whole world made 
the subject of a petition from the 
Colonists.</p>    
    
<p>I am inclined to believe that 
the Colonists, particularly the Com-
mercial part of the community 
are opposed to this <unclear/>, as
they also were to the opening of 
the River to the French. and 
not to little purpose.</p>
    
<p>The advantages to the desired
from the force navigations of the 
Gambia, as far as the United-
States are concerned are at</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616-_095449"/>

<p>present, perhaps, important
But I am convinced that the 
future will tend to increase
those advantages.</p>
    
<p>The river is navigable to ves-
sels drawing not more than eight 
feet of conter as far as Me'
Calhip Island the principal
British settlement, and about 
two hundred miles above this.
The puncipal articles of pro-
duce procured in the River are
Governed Weeks (Peamoks), of
which the animal export for 
the past year was 15728 tons
requiring a considerable 
amount of shipping to bring
these here to market.
About 70,000 hides and 100 tons
of Beeswax exported in the lame 
period of time.</p>
    
<p>This carrying trade is now per-
pound by British vessels almost
entirely, Most of the French 
vessels being too large or dread-
ing too much waken to ascend</p>    
    
<pb facs="20170616_095455"/>
    
<p>the river to any distance.
American vessels from their 
perticularly flat build and 
large deer capacity are better
adapted than either British or 
French for this carrying trade.</p>

<p>The British trade as at 
present carried on is not a rely
profitable one. There are Eight
English + three French Houses
enfafed in it from this port.
Perces obtained for goods, in 
the River, are large and remu=
wershice, but the disadvantages
and lopes aside 1st. From 
employing native Mandingors
(in whose language there appoars
to be no such word as honesty)
for traders. I From the <unclear/> 
of small vessels required to bring 
the produce to town, the expense
of which, increases very considerably
the price of the produce.</p>
    
<p>It has occured to me that this
matter would be worthy the con-
-sideration of the United States</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_095500"/>
    
<p>and that perhaps the present 
would be favorable moment
for bringing it before Her Majesty's
Goverment.</p>    
    
<p>Should it be the wish of the Depart-
-ment I should be of ad upon the 
return of the healthy season
commencing in November or 
December to ascend the River
as far as Mo' Caithy Island
and make a report thereon.</p>
    
<p>I regret that my present
state of health requires a chance
of climate and ascending to the 
order of my medical man I 
shall be obligd to leave my Con-
-suate for the coming two months 
and proceed to the Island of Seneieffe.</p>
    
<p>I have appointed 
Mr. Richard Charles Lloyd Acting 
Consul during my absence.
I have the honor to be 
Sir,
Your most obident servant 
Daniel R.B. Upton
United States Consul</p>
