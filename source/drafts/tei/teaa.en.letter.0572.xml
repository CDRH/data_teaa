<p>Gamery Park House
New York 6th of Sept. 1858</p>
    
<p>Sir,
On the eve of my departure 
from Bathrush, River Gambia, for 
this country for the benefit of my
health,- I had the honor to receive
your commerce rashion of the fifth-
<unclear/> of May last informing me,
that the President of the United States
had seen fit to appoint me Com-
mercial Agent for the United States
at that port.</p>
    
<p>I most beg to reclose the 
official bond duty signed, sealed, and Bond
vertified to, by the United States enclosed
Attorney for the <unclear/>

To the Honorable 
Lewis Cap
Secretary of State</p>
    
<pb facs="20170615_161918"/>
    
<p>I was born in Para,
Brazit, and an the sow of Mr.
Benjamin Upton, an American
citizen, lately appointed Com-
mercial Agent for Rosaire, Argentina
Confederation, and have resided
there years in Bathurst and 
received my appointment form 
the State of New York.</p>
    
<p>It is in my opinion 
necessary for the interests of the 
United States, that an evacuation 
be procured from the British Green
-meerch; particularly as there has 
hitherto been no American Consulate
represent a hive at that Colony.</p>

<p>I shall be ready to proceed when 
to my post, by the first conveyanace,
which with he by a vessel of my own
to sail in about three weeks.</p>

<p>It would be well to forward
to new address in this city, the Books</p>
    
<pb facs="20170615_161939"/>
<p>for the same consequence as mother
opportunity may not reoccur for some 
time.</p>
    
<p>The number of American 
vessels at Bathrust during the 
year is about thirty and I would 
respectfully submit to your consider-
ation, whether to lase an American
interest would not warrant the 
establishment of a consulate.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedt. + honorable servant,
Daniel R.B. Upton

U.S. Commercial Agent</p>
