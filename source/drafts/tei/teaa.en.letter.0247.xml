New York, October 31, 1898.

The Hon. John Hay,
Secretary of State,
Washington, D.C.,

My Dear Sir:-

I have the honor to submit to you an additional document 
to my communicarions delievered to you in person in your office Wedensday,
October 19, bearing upon the present condition of the Republic of 
Liberia. This document is a copy of an article that has recently 
appeared in an English paper, and presents so pertinently additional 
matter in reference to the crisis in which the Republic of Liberia 
now finds itself that I deem it important that you should have it.

The Hon. Issac Townsend Smith, Consul in this City for the 
Siam Government, is called to Washington on official business, to meet 
the Minister of that country, and I take the liberity of asking him to 
hand it to you in person. 

Mr. Smith has given large attention to the history and present 
condition of Liberia, and will also be prepared to give additional 
information if so desired.

I have the honor to be, dear sir, Yours sincerely,
J.C. Hawkled 
speak every* to U.S. from No
Liberia Republic 8

Other documents and letters could be added indicating 
serious crisis which has come to the Republic of Liberia and the 
anxiety with which its administration looks to the United States
and Great Britain for sympathy and practical assistance. 
Naturally Liberia turns first of all to America, from which country 
came its founders and which their children have been taught to 
regard with almost filial affection. Next to America stands Great
Britain inthe thought and confidence of Liberia, and if America 
can not give practical aid in this time of need the Republic will 
hope that her Majesty's Government will hear its plea for friendly 
assistance. 

While in London en route from Africa to America, I presented 
my letter from Liberia to the foreign office and her Majesty's 
Government, and was granted a cordial and extended interview.
The result of this interview was to the effect that England was 
friendly to Liberia but felt that it would be proper for her to 
wait for the United States to take the initative in any movement 
which had to do directly with that Governemnt. 

9

I was given to understand that there was but little doubt 
that Great-Britain would co-operate, if requested to do so, in any
initative movement which the United States might inauguarte in
guaranteeing the independence of Liberia, and tender friendly aid in
strengthening its Government and developing its territory.

To say that the hope of the friends of the negro as a 
nationbuilder have been realized during the last fifty years in Liberia 
would not be true; on the other hand, to accept the uncharitable
and unling criticims of the struggling Republic which are heard 
along the coast from among traders and travelers, and even reiterated 
in Europe and America would be doing great injustice to 
the people of Liberia. Liberia is one of the several centres of 
Missionary operations under my official care as the Bishop of 
Africa represneting the Methodist Episocal Church, and in my official 
duties I have made two visits to the Republic and visited 
all its principal centres and sought carefully to study the 
conditions and outlook of its Government and people. When we consider
the difficulties which the Republic has had to meet in a new, and 
hostile clime; their lack of wealth and experience in Government, 
surronded and permeared by multitudes of barbarous heathen 
and subjected constantly to the uncharitable critisms of 
white traders and travelers; the marvel is that so much in the
way of efficient Government and advance in social conditions, has 
been accomplished. True their national domain, rich in mineral 
and agricultural possibilities has as yet been but little explored;
but it is also true that, until within a very few years, but 
little advance has been made by other nations on either coast 
of the continent in extending practical and efficient Government 
among the natives of the Interior. It must also be remembered 
that the advance made the past few years outside of Liberia has
been the result of enormous expenditure in money, backed by 

10

powerful Governments, able to command the best administrative 
talent.

The moral obligation of the United State to Liberia is unquestioned. 
For more than two generations a large number of prominent 
philanthropists and statesmen in America, have done what they 
could by moral and financial aid to help Liberia. Several of the 
great church organizations of this country have expended large
sums of money and sent out scores of missionary ministers and 
teachers for the Liberian people. We have over nine millions of 
negroes in America among whom there is a profound sentiment that 
in some way they are to aid inthe redemption of Africa. This 
sentiment has been inculcated into their minds for generations by American
statesmen and clergymen. Liberia is to-day practically, the only 
open door for the intelligent and aggressive negro men and women 
in America to ebter upon educational and missionary work among
their race in Africa. If Liberia can be assured a stable Government, if
her custom receipts abd expenditures can be efficiently administred, 
if she can have aid in the development of her educational system,
if her domain can be explored and lines of communication
be opened up between different portions of her territory, if her 
mineral and aggricultureal possibilities can be developed; in
short, if United States or England alonf or in co-operation with
each other, will now hear the cry of Liberia for protection, 
encouragment and such practical assistance as can be easily and
properly given, there will be no question not only as to the 
permant success of Liberia as a Government but also the way will
be opened for many of our Afro-Americans to have honorable 
share in the redemption of the land of their fathers.

The request of the Liberian Government is, that a 
treaty be negotiable that will guarantee the indpendence of 
that Republic and the integrity of its territory. Such a 
treaty if once promulgated would end all 

11

anxiety on the part of the struggling Republic as to other nations
who are now anxious to secure its territory; it would greatly improve 
the Republic's financial standing and possibilities; and 
would stregthen every element od its Government, as well as easy,
social, educational and religious endeavor among its people. 

Among the practical results likely to be assured from such a 
treaty might be named the following:-

(1) The Naval vessels of the United States would visit 
the Liberian ports and ther would be such interchnage of National 
and Social amenities as would have a large moral effect upon the 
surronding heathen tribes.

(2) If thought desirable on the part of the United States 
a coaling station with suitable adjacent lands could be
established at Cape Palmas or Monrovia.

(3) Scientific eploring expeditions with the co-opertation 
and possible direction of Americans or Englishmen could be 
carried out.

(4) American capital would be encouraged to enter Liberia 
and would no doubt find profitable investment 

(5) A very great impetus would be given to educational 
and church work throughout the Republic new being carried on by 
benevolent and church organizations in America. 

Africa, outside of the Republic of Liberia. which Republic is about as 
large as the state of Nebraska, is rapidly passing under the rule 
of European white Governments. Liberia the offspring of American
philanthrophy and co-operation is the only civilized Government in
Africa, controlled and manned by negroes, and upon that Government 
the friends of the negro throughout the world have looked with 
great anxiety. America is morally bound to co-operation in every 
way possible to insure the success of the experiment. Recently in

12

the most marvelous manner America has assumed broader and larger 
relations to the world and its people outside of her own domain, 
and this appeal from Liberia comes at a time when the responsibilities 
and duties of America to the needt of other lands, have been 
most powerfully impressed upon the National heart and conscience.

I will sail for Africa within a few weeks and my first point 
of Episcopsl visitation will be Liberia. Any service which it is in my
power to render in behalf of Liberia to you, my dear Sir, as 
representing the United States, shall be gladly given. and may I 
not hope that I may be permitted to bear to the Liberian Government, 
assurances that in the near future steps may be taken looking to 
the establishment of a treaty such as has been suggested.

I have the honor to be, my dear Sir,
Sincerely yours,
J.C.Hawkeld,
British of Africa and 
speak Every on behalf of
Liberian Government

LIBERIA 

From our Liverpool Correspondent 

The sad murder of two French travelers in the territories of the 
Liberian Republic has provided the French Government with a powerful and 
singularly opportune weapon in the furtherance with a powerful and 
encroachment upon that Negro State. The German Emperor has recently 
shown to the world to what excellent use, in the shape of territorial 
aggrandizement, the assassination of a few missionaries may be pit; and 
although Messrs. Bailly-Forfillere and Pauly were not missionaries, their 
deaths may be turned to an equally good account, for, both with the 
Chinese Empire and the Republic of Liberia, the possibilities of a
successful resistance to preposterous demands for compensation are not 
perceptible.

I do not know whether the French Government has demanded compensation 
from the Republic. But the designs of France on Liberia have become 
so palpable during the last few years that it would be displaying 
a crass stupidity not to take very serious notice of this incident in
light of the consequences to which it may give arise.

As most people know, Liberia is an indpendent Negro Republic 
which owers its inception to the philanthropic insitincts to the people of
the United States, following in the wake of our own somewhat similar 
efforts in Sierra Leone. A colony of freed American negroes was gradually 
formed at Monrovia and various other points on the Grain Coast, and 
in 1847 the colonists were endowed with the consitution of the United 
States. Ever since, the Liberian Republic has eked out a somewhat 
miserable exsistence, falling every year deeper into debt, and 
conclusively providing in a thousand ways that the American negro lacks the
elementary principles of self-government, being deficient in the very
essentialties of constructive administration. certain foreign powers

1

have endeavored to take advantage of the utter incapacity of the 
Liberians, and their motives in doing so are not far to seek. Not only 
are the territories owned by the Liberian Republic quite exceptionally 
rich in West African products, but it so happens that the Liberian
coast is the home of the very best labor which West Africa can produce. 
The fame of thr Krooby is proverbial; without his magnigicent muscles 
and his cheerful willingness to work, our colonie would suffer most 
severely; it would be almost impossible for merchants to carry on several
deprived, to their disadvantage, of native firemen and stokers.
French and Geerman Intrigues.

It must be perfectly obvious to all those who are in any way 
interested in this question that for years past two great Powers, France 
and Germany, have been silently, and without undue osentation, working 
to get Liberia under their control. Whether there be collusion between 
them in this particular case is uncertain, but as Franco-German interests 
work harmoniously together in other parts of Africa, the hypothesis is 
by no means an unlikely one. However, that may be, France as is 
customary with her, is seeking to attain her ends through political 
action; Germany principally by commerical transactions on a large scale.
The former hopes to estalbish, if, indeed, she has not already 
established a sort of right of pre-emption over the whole of the Liberian
territory, filching here and there a slice when the opportunity presents 
itself. Germany is endeavoring to get the finances of this unfortunate 
State into her own hads, and, what perhaps is more dangerous still, 
trying to obtain a monopoly over Kroo labour throughout the territories
of the Republic. 

2

French intrigues in Liberia are not of yesterday. In 1879 a 
very definite rumer arose that France had offered protections to Liberia,
which would probably have been accepted by the latter had not the 
American Government, ever mindful of its inexperienced offspring stepped 
in and intimated to the French Government that such a course would be 
viewed with disfavour in the States. In 1884 the rumours were renewed,
and we find United States informing M. Roustan (French Minister at Washington)
that "Liberia, although not a colony of the United States, 
began its independent career as an offshoot of that country, which bore 
to it a quasi- parental relationship, which authorized the United States
to interpose its good offices in any contest between Liberia and a 
foreign State, and that a refusal to give the United States an opportunity 
to be heard for this purpose would make an unfavorable impression 
on the minds of the Government and the people of the United States."
Again, in 1887, on the reported French aggression in Liberian territory,
the United States were compelled to draw attention of the French 
Government to the fact that their relations with the Republic of Liberia 
had not changed, and that they still felt justified in employing their 
good offices on her behalf.

The Treaty of '92.
For five years the French desisted from their efforts. But on
December 8, 1892, they succeeded in inducing the foolish legislators of 
Liberia to accept a treaty by which France, while making some so called
concessions in the interior, which the French knew would be no more use 
to Liberia than tot he Emperor Menelik, grabbed a large slice of Liberian
territory between the San Pedro and Cavally Rivers, substituting the 
latter river for the former as the boundary between the French possessions

3

on the Ivory Coast and Liberia. By this means a valuable portion
of Liberia territory became French. And, to accentuate the irony of 
the situation France is now repudating her 'Concessions" in the interior 
to Liberia, on the plea that added geographical knowledge has materially 
altered the conclusions upon which the arrangement was based.

But the treaty did more than that. There can be no doubt as to 
the motives of the policy which dictated Article V. of the Franco-Liberian 
Agreement, nor that M. Hanotaux, in getting it accepted, showed his 
usual diplomatic skill. The translation of Article V. (the text is in 
French) reads as follows:-

In recognizing to the Republic of Liberia the limits which 
have now been fixed (after stripping Liberia of part of her 
dominions France graciously allows her to retain the rest) the Government 
of the French Republic declares that it only intends building itself
towards the Republic of Liberia, free and independent, and makes all 
its reserves in case this independence were to be impaired or in
the event that the Republic of Liberia should alienate any part 
of the territories which are recognized to her by the present 
Convention.

The designs of France are at once disclosed in the above Article. 
If Liberia wishes at any time to dispose of a portion of her territory 
to another power, France tears up the Convention, and reserves herself 
the right to take any action which may seem fit to her. In other words,
it is a distinct threat to Liberia never to cede any of her territory 
to anybody but France, under penalty of diplomatic remonstrance, followed 
by physical action, which would obviously entail more land-grabbing.

GERMAN CONCESSION-HUNTERS.

We must now turn to German proceedings in the Republic. Her
merchants and her traders have been worming themselves for years past 
into the very vitals of Liberia. Rubber concessions, coffee concessions,
territorial concessions of all kinds obtained by the judicial expenditure 
of "palm pil"; loans contracted; a gradual but steady grip closing 
round the finances of the country; and now the boldest stroke of all,
the purchase by a German firm of the monopoly of recruiting and shipping 
Krooboys all along the Liberian coast. Small wonder that this latest
barefaced attempt to capture the free labour market of West Africa has 
evoked a spirited protest from the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce.

Now it is necessary that the Governments of Great Britain and of 
the United States should look this matter squarely in the face. I have 
shown, I think conclusively, that the future of Liberia is being gravely 
compromised by French and German action. "Her very independence is at 
stake, and the freedom of her subjects imperilled. Are the statesmen 
of the United States, who in 1879, in 1884, and again in 1887, forbade 
outside interference with Liberian affairs- are they prepared in 1898 
to acquiesce in Liberia becoming an extension of the French Ivory Coast?
As for Great Britain her duty is clear. She should refuse peremptorily 
and at once to countenance any sort or kind of arrangement which places
restrictions on the free recruiting of Krooboys on the Liberia Coast.
That done, London and Washington must arrive at an understanding which 
shall save Liberia both from the incompetence of her own legislators, 
and from becoming a prety to the cupidity of the Continental Powers.
