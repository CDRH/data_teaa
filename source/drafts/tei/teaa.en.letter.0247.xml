LIBERIA 

From our Liverpool Correspondent 

The sad murder of two French travelers in the territories of the 
Liberian Republic has provided the French Government with a powerful and 
singularly opportune weapon in the furtherance with a powerful and 
encroachment upon that Negro State. The German Emperor has recently 
shown to the world to what excellent use, in the shape of territorial 
aggrandizement, the assassination of a few missionaries may be pit; and 
although Messrs. Bailly-Forfillere and Pauly were not missionaries, their 
deaths may be turned to an equally good account, for, both with the 
Chinese Empire and the Republic of Liberia, the possibilities of a
successful resistance to preposterous demands for compensation are not 
perceptible.

I do not know whether the French Government has demanded compensation 
from the Republic. But the designs of France on Liberia have become 
so palpable during the last few years that it would be displaying 
a crass stupidity not to take very serious notice of this incident in
light of the consequences to which it may give arise.

As most people know, Liberia is an indpendent Negro Republic 
which owers its inception to the philanthropic insitincts to the people of
the United States, following in the wake of our own somewhat similar 
efforts in Sierra Leone. A colony of freed American negroes was gradually 
formed at Monrovia and various other points on the Grain Coast, and 
in 1847 the colonists were endowed with the consitution of the United 
States. Ever since, the Liberian Republic has eked out a somewhat 
miserable exsistence, falling every year deeper into debt, and 
conclusively providing in a thousand ways that the American negro lacks the
elementary principles of self-government, being deficient in the very
essentialties of constructive administration. certain foreign powers
