<p>Liverpool<lb/>
January 31st 1884</p>

<p>Hon. John Davis<lb/>
Assist. Secty of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honour respectfully 
to enclose herewith account
of my transit from my post of
duty to this city where I have
been under medical care ever
since my arrival; copies of Doctors
certificates enclosed.</p>

<p>On my leaving Africa, I was
almost too sick to know what I
was doing, consequently signed
drafts No 7 and eight, in favour of

<pb facs="Scan30015"/> 

Robert S. Newton with the understanding 
that the gentleman
will deduct from said amount
$50 per month for his trouble and
clerk hire, and send me the balance
in a check here; but he has failed 
to do so by the two mails from
Africa, consequently I stopped
payment of check No 7 and 8.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Ls de R du Verge<lb/>
US Consul</p>

<p>51 Grove St<lb/>
Liverpool<lb/>
January 18. 1884</p>

<p>I hereby certify that L. de R. du Verge Esq. Consul
of the United States of America at Loanda has since
his arrival in Liverpool (for more than a fortnight)
been under my medical care, he has had a relapse
of the intermittant Fever from which he has been
suffering in Africa with congestion of the liver,
vomiting, purging, &amp; exhaustion, he has been quite
unfit for travelling, the prostration from which
he suffered, requiring him to remain in bed; I
have advised him not to return to his ordinary
duties at present but to have further respite from
travelling for a time to entirely get rid of the miasmatic
influence he appears to me likely to recover.</p>

<p>36th Rodney St<lb/>
Liverpool<lb/>
Feb 2. 1884</p>

<p>Mr L. de R. du Verge, U.S. Consul
from Africa has been under
my professional care since
the 16th Jan: since that time he
has been confined chiefly to
the house with African
miasmatic fever, congestion
of the liver and spleen inflamation 
of the intestines
and slight dysentery, &amp; consequently
has been unable to
during that time to undertake 
any journey</p>
