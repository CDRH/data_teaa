<p>The African at Home</p>

<p>By Booker T. Washington</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<note>As Mr. Washington illustrates his point that the "education of the native African in the white man's civilization must being much further back," just so he begins to tell herewith the Story of the Negro much further back than he and other writers have hitherto gone. This is as it should be. It has long been wished by earnest friends of the race that Mr. Washington would give an historic resume of  his race. These timely articles, taken from <hi rend="italics">The Outlook</hi>, later to be compiled in book form, not only because of their delightful teaching, but their historical value, should be preserved. - Editor.</note>

<p>Some time during the latter part of 1899, or the early part of 1900, I received through the German Embassy, in Washington, a letter saying that the German Colonial Society wanted a number of students from Tuskegee to go out to German West Africa to teach the natives how to produce cotton by American methods.</p>

<p>While I had been a student at Hampton Institute, Virginia, it was one of my ambitions, as it has been the ambition of a great many other Negro students before and since, to go out some day to Africa as a missionary. I believed that I had got hold at Hampton a kind of knowledge that would be peculiarly helpful to the native Africans, and I felt that my interest in the people out there, vague and indefinite as it was, would in some way or other help and inspire me in the task of lifting them to a higher plane of civilization.</p>

<p>After I went to Tuskegee I gave up my ambition of going to Africa. I had not been long there, however, before I was convinced that I could, perhaps, be of larger usefulness through the work I was able to do in this country, by fitting for the same service I wanted to perform Africans who came as students to America, and by sending from Tuskegee men and women trained in our methods as teachers and workers among the native peoples. The request I received through the German Embassy was therefore particularly welcome to me, for it gave me an opportunity to realize, in a direct way, the ambition I had never wholly lost sight of.</p>

<p>A group of our best students was selected for this African mission. They went out to Togoland, West Africa, and began to establish stations in different points in that colony, and then started in to grow cotton, using the native labor as far as they were able, but necessarily, at first, doing a large part of the work themselves.</p>

<p>They met all sorts of difficulties. They found the American cotton was not suited to African soil, and were compelled to cross it with native varieties in order to produce a hybrid type that possessed 

<pb xml:id="p2" facs="teaa.en.periodical.0070.002"/>

the valuable qualities of both. They had considerable difficulty at first with the native laborers. I remember that John Robinson, one of the party who remained to carry out the work after the others had returned home, told me of an incident which made me see in a way in which I had not been able to see before that the education of the native African in the white man's civilization must begin much further back and with much simpler matters than most of us are likely to imagine.</p>

<p>Among the other things this party had taken out to Africa was a wagon which had been manufactured by the students at Tuskegee. While this wagon was being unloaded and put together, the native porters looked on with interest, never having seen anything that went on wheels before. After the wagon had been loaded ready to start, the attention of members of the party was turned for a time in another direction. When they came back to the wagon, they were greatly surprised to see that the natives had unloaded and taken it apart, and were busily engaged in fastening its wheels and other parts on their heads, preparatory to carrying them, along with the other goods, to their destination in the interior. Mr Robinson explained to them, through an interpreter, the use of the wagon, and tried to show them the advantage of it. They were interested in seeing this curious machine of the white man work, but they were quite positive in their conviction that the good old-fashioned way of carrying everything on their heads was the better. Now that roads have been opened up and the natives have actually seen a wagon worked, Mr. Robinson tells me they take it as a hardship if they are asked to carry anything.</p>

<p>During the time this experiment in educating the native African was going on I followed its progress, through the accounts I received from students on the ground and from the reports of the German Colonial Society, with close attention and intense interest. It was the nearest I had come, up to that time, to anything like a practical and intimate acquaintance with the African at home.</p>

<p>Among the first things the Tuskegee students did in Africa was to build for themselves comfortable houses, to supply them with well-made but simple furniture, to put in these houses not only the necessities, but some of the comforts of life. It was interested to note that within a few months the natives, and especially the women, had the notion that they wanted the same kind of houses and some of the same kind of furniture. The women naturally made their wants known to the men, and before these students had been in Africa half a dozen years the natives in their vicinity had reached the point where, with the training they had received and with the desire they had gained for better homes to live in, better tools to work with, and for all the other advantages which the black man in America seemed to possess over the black man in Africa, they were performing about as satisfactory service as the same class of human beings would have performed in any other part of the world.</p>

<p>Native Africans have been sent from 

<pb xml:id="p3" facs="teaa.en.periodical.0070.003"/>

Africa to Tuskegee. Our Tuskegee students have returned from time to time and made their reports of successes. Thus in a very vital and practical manner has our institution become connected with the progress and civilization of our bretheren in the darker continent.</p>

<p>Some time ago, in looking through the pages of some magazine or book of science, I ran across a statement that, when men first began to study the stars systematically and with telescopes, they discovered a certain class of errors in their calculations which were due to the personality of the observers. One man's brain, acting quicker, would record the stars as moving more rapidly, another would record them as moving more slowly, than their actual movements. It became necessary, therefore, in order to make the calculations correct, to study and take account of these personal aberrations.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me in the course of my reading about the African peoples that it would contribute much to the accuracy of our knowledge if some study were made of the sort of errors that creep into our observations of human beings. Important as it is that we should have a correct knowledge of the starts, it is more important that we should have an accurate knowledge of men. For instance, I have noticed that a man born and reared in the Southern States invariably looks upon the Negro with different eyes than the man born and reared in the Northern States. In their reports and interpretations of the simplest facts they are often widely divergent in their views. Even when they agree with each other about the Negro, for instance, it has often seemed to me that their agreement was due to a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Frequently amusing situations occur in the discussion of the Negro. Many of these have occurred in my presence. It seldom occurs, for instance, when I am traveling on a train, that the discussion does not turn on the question as to what is the physical, moral, and mental effect on the individual when he is of mixed blood. One man will argue very seriously that there should be no mixture of blood, for the reason that he is quite sure that wherever there is a mixture it results in a weakened individual, bodily, mentally, morally. Within ten or fifteen 

<pb xml:id="p4" facs="teaa.en.periodical.0070.004"/>

minutes another man will begin, in the absence of the first, to discuss the same subject, and will, in an equally serious and positive manner, state that wherever in all history the Negro has been able to accomplish anything of value to the world, it has been because he had some tincture of white blood in his veins.</p>

<p>During these discussions I am sometimes reminded of an incident that occurred during my early boyhood, which, because it illustrates a phase in the development of the Negro in America, I may be permitted to mention here. Very soon after the days of slavery, and even before the public school system had been organized, there arose in the community a discussion among our people as to whether the world was round or flat. It lasted for several days, and divided the community into two pretty stubborn factions. During the discussion a colored man came along, a school-teacher, who had very little actual learning, and made application to open a school. The question as to whether the world was flat or round was submitted to him, or rather he was asked how he would treat the question in the school-room, and he replied that he was prepared to teach either "flat" or "round," just as the individual family requested.</p>

<p>The continual discussion of the Negro often reminds me, as I have stated, of this story. The Negro question, like the Negro himself, seems able to accommodate itself to almost any and every shade of opinion. That explains how two men with diametrically opposite views sometimes come to an agreement about the Negro; one thinks he should be flat and not round, the other thinks he should be round and not flat; but both agree that there is something wrong with him.</p>

<p>If it is difficult for people of the same race to understand one another when they are talking about things in regard to which their experience has been different, it is still more difficult for one race to pass judgment upon another, particularly when these races differ so widely from one another as the white man and the Negro. Dr. Franz Boas has called attention to this difficulty in a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science. "As the white race is the civilized race," he says, "every deviation from the white type is considered as the characteristic feature of a lower type; . . . the greater the difference between the intellectual, emotional, and moral processes and those found in our civilization, the harsher the judgment of the people."</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it is natural enough that the black man, who is furthest removed physically from the white man, should suffer more than others from the sort of prejudice Professor Boas describes. With the possible exception of the Jew, no race has ever been subjected to criticisms so searching and candid, to state it mildly, as the Negro. And yet I have found that those who have known and understood the Negro best have usually been kindest in their judgment of him and most hopeful of his future.</p>

<p>For instance, the late Miss Kingsley, an Englishwoman who seems to have entered deeper into the mind of the West 

<pb xml:id="p5" facs="teaa.en.periodical.0070.005"/>

African than most others, says of the West Coast Negro:</p>

<q>The true Negro is, I believe, by far the better man than the Asiatic; he is physically superior, and he is more like an Englishman than the Asiatic; he is a logical, practical man, with feelings that are a credit to him, and are particularly strong in the direction of property. He has a way of thinking he has rights whether he likes to use them or no, and he will fight for them when he is driven to it. Fight you for a religious idea the African will not; he is not the stuff you make martyrs out of, nor does he desire to shake off the shackles of the flesh and swoon into Nirvana. . . . His make of mind is exceedingly like the make of mind of thousands of Englishmen of the stand-no-nonsense, Englishman's-house-is-his-castle type. Yet, withal, a law-abiding man, loving a live lord, holding loudly that women should be kept in their place, yet often grievously henpecked by his wives, and little better than a slave to his mother, whom he loves with the love he gives to none other.</q>

<p>Concerning the affection which the African has for his mother, Miss Kingsley quotes the Rev. John Wilson.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson was born and educated in South Carolina. In 1834 he went to Africa as a missionary, and remained there for eighteen years, in close contact with the civilization of the forefathers of the present American Negroes. he was among the first missionaries to Africa. He remained in the active service of the Southern Presbyterian Church until his death, in 1886. While in Africa he studied the languages and reduced the native tongue of some of the tribes to writing. He says:</p>

<q>Whatever other estimate we may form of 

<pb xml:id="p6" facs="teaa.en.periodical.0070.006"/>

the African, we may not doubt his love for his mother. Her name, whether dead or alive, is always on the lips and in his heart. She is the first thing he thinks of when awakening from his slumbers and the last thing he remembers when closing his eyes in sleep; to her he confides secrets which he would reveal to no other human being on the face of the earth. He cares for no one else in time of sickness; she alone must prepare his food, administer his medicine, perform his ablutions, and spread his mat for him. He flies to her in the hour of his distress, for he well knows if all the rest of the world turn against him, she will be steadfast in her love, whether he be right or wrong.</q>

<q>If there be any cause which justifies a man using violence towards one of his fellow-men, it would be to resent an insult offered to his mother. More fights are occasioned among boys by hearing something said in disparagement of their mothers than all other causes put together. It is a common saying among them, if a man's mother and his wife are both on the point of being drowned and he can save only one of them, he must save his mother, for the avowed reason if the wife is lost, he may marry another, but he will never find a second mother.</q>

<p>Mr. Wilson points out that the Africans of the Grain Coast have long since risen above the hunting life; they have fixed habitations, cultivate the soil for means of subsistence, have herds of domestic animals, construct for themselves houses which are sufficient to protect them alike from the scorching heat of the sun and the chilly damps of the night; they show a turn for the mechanical arts, and in the fabrication of implements of warfare and articles of ornament they display surprising skill.</p>

<p>"As we see them in their native country," he continues, "they show none of that improvidence or want of foresight for which they have almost become proverbial in this country, which shows that circumstances have made them what they are in this respect. They plant their crops with particular reference to the season of the year, and they store away provisions for their future wants with as much regularity as any people in the world, so that times of scarcity and want are less frequent among them than among others who pretend to a much higher degree of civilization."</p>

<p>Referring to the farms of the Kru people, the tribes from which the seamen of the West Coast are drawn, Mr. Wilson says:</p>

<q>The natives of the Kru country cultivate the soil to some considerable extent. Their farms are generally two or three miles distant from the villages, and are made at this distance to keep them out of the reach of their cattle. Nearer to the villages they have inclosed gardens in which they raise small quantities of plantains, corn, bananas, peas, beans, and a few other vegetables.</q>

<p>Of the mechanical skill of the neighboring Ashanti people, whose territory is in the English Gold Coast colony, Mr. Wilson tells us that "they manufacture gold ornaments of various kinds, and many of them of much real taste. They fabricate swords, agricultural implements, wooden stools, and cotton cloths of beautiful figures and very substantial texture."</p>
