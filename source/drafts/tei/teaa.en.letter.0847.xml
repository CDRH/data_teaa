<note>Department of State Received Jun 26 1880</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate
at Sierra Leone<lb/>
May 24th 1880</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst. Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the
receipt of your dispatch (No 13) of
the 8th ulto, with inclosures relating
to the refusal of the Customs Authorities
at this port to grant clearance to the
American barque "Fury" via Matacong to
Boston &amp;c.</p>

<p>The U.S. Consul for this place
having left on his leave of absence,
I beg to state that I have made inquiry
into the above matter according to your
instructions, and I find, that the cause 
of the refusal on the part of the Customs
Authorities here to grant a clearance
to the "Fury" via Matacong thence
to Boston, without returning to this port
is based upon the claim which the
British Government puts forward
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb n="485"/>

to the island of Matacong and there
being no customs establishment at that
place. With respect to the nature and
extent of the British claims to the
island of Matacong, there is a Treaty,
copy of which I herewith inclose, copied
from Vol II Sierra Leone Ordinance &amp;c
Treaty of 1826. and has only of late
been disputed by the French Government
who, last year, erected a fort on the
island, and placed a garrison there,
against which the colonial authorities
here protested and the matter having 
been <sic>refered</sic> to the respective Governments
in Europe, the French Garrison
has been withdrawn, the British
Government being allowed jurisdiction
over the island pending arbitration on
the subject, and I find further that
the British authorities here had
duly issued a notice to all parties
concerned that all vessels touching at
Matacong, from Sierra Leone, would be
required to return to the latter port
for clearance.</p>

<pb n="486"/>

<p>I beg further to add that Messrs
Randall &amp; Fisher (British Subjects)
are deeply interested in the island as
lessees of the same, and have for
several years monopolised the trade
on the island. It also appears that
<sic>Messes</sic> Randall &amp; Fisher as British Subjects
have been specially notified
by the authorities that duties would be
levied on all merchandise or produce
imported or exported to or from the
island and in order to screen themselves
have induced the French authorities
to lay claim to the island;
and in the matter of the "Fury" it
appears that they are desirous of further
complicating matters by drawing the
U.S. Government into the dispute, to which
cause I think, may be <unclear>traced</unclear> Consul Lewis'
unwillingness to act in the matter.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
M. W. Tobey<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul</p>

with their allies the Tura family.</p>

<p>The Tura family, to whom the
throne of the Mandingo country
belongs, and the chiefs and
headmen of the Soombia Soosoos,
anxious to put an end to the
war which has been carried
on for the last twelve years
between Amurat, the present
chief of the Mandingo Country
and the Soombia Soosoos, and
to draw closer the ties of amity
and friendship which exist
between them and the colony
of Sierra Leone, have deputed
for that purpose the Soombia,
Alimamie Dalla Mahammadoo,

<pb n="488"/>

and Sunkie Brama and the
Tura family. Amurat the head
thereof, and his Honour
Kenneth Macaulay, Acting
Governor of the Colony of Sierra 
Leone and its dependencies, being
willing on the part of His
Britannic Majesty to contribute
to so desirable an object,
the said parties have agreed as
follows:</p>

<p>I&#160; There shall continue to be as heretofore,
friendship, amity, and
free intercourse between all His
Majesty's Subjects and the inhabitants
of the Soombia and
Mandingo Countries, Subject to
the Said Chieftains and family.</p>

<p>II&#160; The Soombia chiefs and headmen
and the Tura family give
and grant to the inhabitants
of Sierra Leone and its dependencies,
and to all other Subjects
of His Britannic Majesty,
free liberty and permission

<pb n="489"/>

to form factories or trading establishments
in all parts of the Soombia
and Mandingo Countries, and
guarantee that the said factories
or trading establishments, with
every person, and all property of
whatever description belonging
thereto, shall be free and exempt
from all country palavers and
arbitrary exactions under whatever
plea the same may be made,
and that all persons shall be at
liberty to carry on their trade in
such manner as they may think proper.</p>

<p>III&#160; The Soombia Chiefs and headmen
promise and guarantee to the Acting
Governor of Sierra Leone and his
Successors on behalf of His Britannic Majesty, that there shall
be free and open roads and
paths for all strangers, traders,
merchants, travellers, or others
to pass and repass through
the said territories, with their
retinue, goods, wares, and

<pb n="490"/>

merchandise, between the colony of
Sierra Leone and the interior
countries of Africa; that the said
persons and their property shall 
be protected; that they shall be
rendered every <sic>asistance</sic> in their
legal pursuits; that they shall
not be called upon or made
to pay any duties, customs, or
Sums of money, on any pretence
whatever, except for Such expense
as they may actually incur;
and that the Said chiefs will
in every instance see Justice
impartially administered between
their Subjects and the 
Said strangers, traders, merchants,
travellers, or others;
and further that the said chiefs
will, to the utmost of their power,
obtain the same freedom of 
road and just treatment for
the said strangers, traders, merchants,
travellers, or others, from
all their neighbours and allies.</p>

<pb n="491"/>

<p>IV&#160; The said chiefs and headmen
promise and engage to abolish
the slave trade, and not
to allow any exportation of
slaves from their respective countries,
nor to allow any vessels,
craft, boats, or canoes to enter
into any of their rivers, creeks,
bays, or waters for the purpose
of buying or selling slaves, or
being in any manner engaged
in the slave trade, nor to allow
factories or other establishments
to be formed in their territories
by any persons whatever for 
the purchasing or selling of 
Slaves.</p>

<p>V&#160; For the purpose of rendering
the provisions of this treaty
more effectual, the said Soombia

coasting trade of the country
that the Island of Matacong 
Should be a neutral and free
resting place for the canoes
and craft belonging to all
the Surrounding tribes,

which may exist among them,

<pb n="494"/>

within their respective territories,
they will at all times be ready
and willing to treat for the cession
of the same on fair and
equitable terms.</p>
