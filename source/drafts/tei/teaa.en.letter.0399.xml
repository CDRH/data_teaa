<p>Loango March the 13th 1883.</p>

<p>To the Commander of the French War Vessel
To anchor in Loango <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having heard from several whitemen, that you
had, or were going to take possession of this country, in the name
of the French Government, and having heard also that the Natives
in that case would out of revenge, attack, plunder, and destroy
the several trading houses in the place, and afterwards take to the
bush, I, undersigned a citizen of the United States of North America
doing business in this pace, and in other points near here, having American
and British properly in charge, find myself obliged to <sic>adress</sic>
you the following considerations</p>

<p>That it is almost certain that as soon as the Natives find
out that you are taken possession of their country, they will out of
revenge, attack factories, and plunder and destroy everything, thus
entailing ruin on innocent traders, who have nothing whatever to do
with these questions.</p>

<p>That the presence of your vessel will not deter them from 
so doing, as they will very likely make a right attack, and by <unclear>making</unclear>
it general preclude the possibility of the white men helping each 
other.</p>

<p>That as soon as they have plundered and destroyed the
Factories, killing very likely also some of the white men, they will
take to the Bush, as the loss of their villages is as nothing to them, making
it impossible to find and punish them.</p>

<p>Considering the Circumstances, the Undersigned
thinks it incumbent to him, as a citizen of the United States</p>
