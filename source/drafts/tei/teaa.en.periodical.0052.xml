<p>Late from Liberia
Return of the Stevens-Letters-Extracts from
Liberian papers.
Return of the Ship Mary Caroline Stevens.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>This fine ship, returning form her ninth voyage to Liberia, after a
passage of thirty days, arrived at Baltimore on the 4th of last month.</p>
<p>She left in the port of Monrovia the brig Palmas, of Baltimore,
soon to sail for the leeward; a schooner from Boston, for sale, about
to leave for Sierra Leone; and the Liberia schooners Moses Sheppard,
James Hall, and the Liberia- all soon to leave for the leeward trade.
Several smaller Liberia vessels were also inside the bar in the Mesu-
rado River. The American brig Ocean Eagle, Capt. Yates, sailed
for New York on the 27th of February, with several missionary pas-
sengers to the Gaboon River.</p>
<p>Among the articles brought home in the ship we notice 145 casks
of palm oil, over 100 tons of camwood, 53 blocks of cedar, 6 packages
of ground-nuts, sundry bags and boxes of coffee and ginger, 24 bbls.
of molasses, and one or two bbls. of sugar. In the cabin came as
passengers, Dr. James Hall, his daughter and her friend Miss Sumner,
Mrs. Seys, wife of the Rev. John Seys; the Rev. Mr. Rambo and
lady, Rev. Mr. Crummell and family, of the Episcopal Mission; Rev.
Mr. White, of the Methodist Mission; Rev. Mr. Officer, of the
Mission of the Dutch Reformed Church, and Dr. Roberts, of Mon-
rovia, and the Rev. M.M. Clark, of the Methodist Mission. There
were also one or two stecrage passengers.</p>
<p>The main features of news in Liberia were the operations of the
Liberia troops under President Benson, in settling a long difficulty
between two native tribes in the County of Maryland. It seems that
a powerful and warlike tribe. emerging from the interior. drove a
coast tribe from their towns and took forcible possession. The Libe-
rian Government have vainly endeavored to settle the matter ami-
cably, and to persuade the invaders to surrender their ill-gotten spoils
and territory and retire. The only reply has been, "Might makes
right," setting the Liberian authorities at defiance. President Benson
found it necessary to take one hundred and fifty men and go down
and bring them to terms. Some pretty serious fighting was the
result, and an ultimate yielding on the part of the native chiefs, pay-
ment of expenses of the war, and retiring again to the bush. The
Liberians lost three men only, two privates and Major Pickett. of
Maryland County, who fell while storming a barricaded town.</p>
<p>It was thought Mr. Benson would be re-elected to the Presidency,
though he is warmly opposed by Mr. Yates, formerly Vice President.</p>
<p>The "Congo question," as the Liberians term the introduction of
recaptured Africans, has caused no little excitement. All, however,
is quiet now on that score. Those landed at Sinou have proved
somewhat refractory, but President Benson will no doubt settle all
difficulties.</p>
<p>The Republic is reported to be in a prosperous condition. The
sugar-making is on the increase, as also the culture of coffee, cotton,
and other tropical productions. The multiplication of interior settle-
ments is now under consideration, and a measure so important will
not, we trust, be left long unaccomplished.</p>
<p>No letters from the Liberian authorities arrived by this ship, owing,
it is presumed, to the absence of President Benson, who was engaged
successfully in repelling the hostilities of a native tribe near Sinou.</p>
<p>In our last number we mentioned the negotiation of a treaty with
the Government of Liberia, by our able Commissioner, Dr. James
Hall, under instructions from the Board of Directors, by which the
management of recaptured Africans, after their arrival in that Re-
public, is confided to that Government; which, we are happy to be-
lieve, will adopt a wise and hamane policy for their civilization and
welfare, in preparation for their admission to all the duties and im-
munities of citizenship. We are very happy to publish the following
extracts from a letter from the Rev. John Seys, U.S. Agent; obser-
vations made by that excellent Missionary of the Episcopal Church
the Rev. C.C. Hoffmn, who returned in the <unclear/> to Cape
Palmas, and other communications.</p>
