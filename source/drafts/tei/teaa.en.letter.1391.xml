<p>United States Consulate General<lb/>
Monrovia June 27th 1882</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<p>I have the honor to respectfully inform your that, the American Bark called the Liberia, Capt. John Peterson, cleared from this port on the 24th of June 1882 for Robertsport, a small seaport about 40 miles distant from Monrovia, and within the dominion of the Republic of Liberia; aforesaid Bark, as I learn, sailed from that port for the port of New York U.S.A. and will touch at the English <sic>Colonie</sic>, Sierra Leone. No certificate of Invoice, for the cargo taken in on this coast, has been taken in the different Consular districts, in this Republic by the master or <sic>Supper</sic> cargo of aforesaid vessel, notwithstanding the attention was special called to this requirement, by the U.S. consular officers at the ports of Grand Bassa and Monrovia within this Republic.</p>

<p>I am also informed by a reliable person that the Invoice of the cargo of aforesaid vessel include <hi rend="underline">more than one consignor</hi> to <catchwords>one</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honble J. C. Bancroft Davis<lb/>
Assistt. Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-3050.jpg"/>

one Consignee, in violation of the Circular from the Department of State dated June 20th 1881.</p>

<p>I respectfully call the attention to this fact, that, should the U.S. Consul at the English <sic>Colonie</sic>, Sierra Leone, be permitted, to certify to Invoices of products, originating from the Republic of Liberia, that it will be impossible for the U.S. Consular officers, residing within this Republic, to make a correct statement of the trade between the U.S. of America and Liberia, as it is impossible to get a correct information from the Custom houses in Liberia.</p>

<p>I also have to report of the same vessel, that the master has sailed from here, without supplying himself with a bill of <sic>healt</sic>; while there exist no contagious disease, and a perfect <sic>healt</sic> prevail throughout the country; such actions lead to negligence and deprive the U.S. Government of the Customary consular fees.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir<lb/>
Your obedt servant<lb/>
M. A Aenmey.<lb/>
act U.S. Consul. Genl.</p>
