<p>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
December 14th 1882</p>

<p>Hon: Wm. Hunter
Asst. Sectry of State.
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of 
your desparch No 10, in regard to Agents appointed
by me until approved by the Hon: Sectry of State;
it was and still is with the intention of promoting
Am: Commerce in this part of the world, beside
putting a stop to run away seaman, for abuse
received on board Am: whalers, and while 
enforcing the U.S. law over this jurisdiction, to 
give prompt justice to seamen, masters or officers.
"Mossamedes" will in a few years become important
large fields of wheat, corn, sugar cane, and 
cotton are now in cultivation.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Govt. is organizing small colonies
all over that district, The Boers in "Whilloh"
and "Humpata" are cutting conformity with 
the Portuguese a route from the interior; so 
that their crops, and the result of their <unclear>bounty</unclear> 
such as Hides, Ivory &amp; Ostrich Feathers, can
be carried to Mossamedes: these colonies
as well as the Boers;- and even the natives 
of the interior who seem to follow now the

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0157.003"/>
example of the Boers will soon want
Farming <unclear/> to; and I do not
know if any to be compared with those
of the U.S. for simplicity, denability and 
cheapness. The merchants and large
land bulders will need also steam
mills, and other machinery for making
Rum, Sugar, grinding corn and wheats, 
cleaning and pressing cotton &amp;a&amp;a
Am: Whalers seem to make their head quarters
now at the place, although the best <unclear/>
have been grand to them by the Portuguese govt.
at Loanda.</p>

<p>To understand that nine Whalers were 
there during the last two months. From the 
"Eliza Adams" three seamen ran away, and 
from the " Alice Knowles" a man was discharged
by reason of sickness; these seamen have
been sent to me from Mossamedes at a 
great expense, and I find myself compelled
to keep them until I am able to forward
them to Santiago "Cape de Verde" by mail steamers
which only takes them occasionally, more
as a favor, although I pay to the Capt.
<unclear>pound symbol</unclear> 5.0.0, for each man.</p>

<p>Mr. J. L. <unclear>Povres</unclear> that I appointed until
approved by the Hon: Sectry of State is the 
largest merchant of Mossamedes, a young

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0157.004"/>
man, full of energy, and ambitions to 
promote the commerce and developent
of Mossamedes.</p>

<p>It is only upon close inquiry, as to be;
capacity, intergrity, capability &amp;a&amp;a that 
I appointed him. If the state Dept has
any objections to these appointments, I 
will nofify them at once as not having 
been accepted by the state Dept.
I have never seen either of the gentlemen
at Ambriz, Benguella &amp; Mossamedes;
but I am confident that an agent is 
needed at Mossamedes for the interest
of Am: Commerce and protection of
Am: Seamen and others visiting that 
port.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be 
Sir
Your obedient servant
L de R. du Verge</p>

obtained in Loanda</note>
