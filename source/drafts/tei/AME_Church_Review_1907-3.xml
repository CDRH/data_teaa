              <head>SOME NOTED NEGROES OF THE PAST. </head>
   <p>Besides the men and women fairly well known to the person 
of average information by reason of their appearance,
more or less fully and frequently, in the pages of history or
current literature, there are characters not a few deserving of
public presentation, whose names are hidden away in fugitive
pamphlets, old books out of circulation, or in the memories
of contemporaries still alive, but soon to pass because of age.
These names ought to be preserved to history and to the Negro
race, for it is not so rich in heroic personalities that it can afford 
to let one pass from existence for lack of a biographer, or
at least an index finger pointing to the place in some musty corner 
of an old library where the facts can be found.</p>
   <p>The names of men like <rs type="person">Douglass</rs> in <placeName>America</placeName>, <rs type="person">Dumas</rs> in
<country>France</country>, or <rs type="person">Toussaint L'Ouverture</rs> in <country>Hayti</country>, are safely history's; 
there are others full worthy of an equally honorable,
if not an equally illustrious, page, from whom the obscuration
of the studied silence of Caucasian book-makers must be
lifted.</p>
   <p>It has been said, and is to a degree true, that the Negro

<fw>2                         THE  REVIEW</fw>
is so busy making history that he has not time to write it. It
may state a fact, but it declares a deficiency also; for the men
and deeds, noble though they be, that die for want of a chronicler, 
exercise no influence in fixing the capacity of a race, refuting 
the malicious diatribes of <hi rend="italic">a priori </hi>dogmatists, inspiring
the hopes of following generations, or justifying the faith of
sturdy friends. Men, therefore, like <rs type="person">Daniel Murray</rs> and <rs type="person">Wm.
C. Bolivar</rs>, who are devoting all their leisure moments to the
discovery of such persons and to the unearthing of creditable
records too long buried, are of a class which is doing more valuable 
work for race vindication than most of the men who
regard the deed without the record.</p>
   <p>The writer, acknowledging the inspiration of their example 
and mindful of the mission of the A. M. E. Review,
has, in this series, attempted to "lend a hand."</p>
   <p>The first person to whom the reader's attention is directed is

                      <rs type="person">Robert Campbell</rs>.</p>
<p>   In 1858, a year previous to that made memorable in
American history as the time when <rs type="person">John Brown's</rs> raid at <placeName>Harper's 
Ferry</placeName> precipitated the <q>"irrepressible conflict"</q> that destroyed 
human slavery, a body of earnest humanitarians met
together and formed what they called the "General Board of
Commissioners" to plan and provide for an exploration, scientific 
and anthropological, of that part of <placeName>Central Africa</placeName> occupied by 
the Egbas and Zorubas. The purpose was not avowedly, 
to ascertain the fitness of that region for the residence of

                      <fw>SOME NOTED  NEGROES                          3</fw>
the American Negro, though, doubtless, that had a large unacknowledged 
place in their minds.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen forming this Board of Commissioners
were men well known in their day around <name type="city">Philadelphia</name> and
the North. <rs type="person">William Howard Day</rs>, President; <rs type="person">Matisen F.
Bailey</rs>, Vice President; <rs type="person">Geo. W. Brodie</rs>, Secretary; <rs type="person">James
Madison Bell</rs>, Treasurer; <rs type="person">Alfred Whipple</rs>, Auditor; <abbr type="title">Dr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Martin 
R. Delany</rs>, Special Foreign Secretary; <rs type="person">Isaac D. Shadd</rs>,
who subsequently took Mr. Bailey's place as Vice President;
<rs type="person">Abram D. Shadd</rs> and <rs type="person">James Henry Harris</rs>.</p>
   <p>All of these men had shown a profound interest in the
promotion of the political and general interests of the colored
inhabitants of <placeName>North America</placeName>, especially of the <country>United States</country>
and <country>Canada</country>. After due deliberation, it was decided to organize 
"The Niger Valley Exploring Party" for the purpose
of visiting the <placeName>Niger region</placeName> to make a topographical, geological
and geographical examination of it; to inquire also into the
state and condition of the people of the valley, with such other
scientific inquiries as might be deemed expedient for the
purpose of science and for general information; but it was explicitly 
stated that the expedition had no reference to an emigration movement, 
the board being, in fact, opposed to the idea.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, it would require a stretch of faith not likely
to be exercised by our readers who know of the oppression
and interest of the Negro in America at that time, to ask them
to believe that this party of Negro explorers were going out

<fw>4                          THE REVIEW</fw>
for pure love of science and in absolute disregard of the fitness
of Africa as a haven for their kinsmen in tribulation.</p>
   <p>Among the five chosen for this work was Professor <rs type="person">Robert Campbell</rs>, 
of whom we write. He was one of the earliest
and most eminent scientists produced by the Negro race in
America, holding at the time of his appointment the professorship 
of Science in the famous Institute for Colored Youth,
<name type="city">Philadelphia</name>, recently removed from that city to <name type="city">Cheyney</name>,
<region>Pa.</region>, about 20 miles away, where it still flourishes under the
management of the Friends.</p>
   <p>It was because of Professor Campbell's scientific attainments 
that he was selected for the exploring party, for it was
desired that the observation should not be superficial or hasty,
but thorough and competent.</p>
   <p>He was not a full-blood Negro, but a quadroon, resembling
in personal appearance a Scotchman in cast of face and in his
raw-boned frame. His eye was keen and piercing, his nose
thin and sensitive, well bridged and straight. The mouth was
thin and straight-lined, the chin pronounced and inclined to
be square; the cheek-bones prominent; while a mustache and
scrawny, scattering beard covered his lower face. Altogether,
his was the make-up to undertake the arduous duties assigned
him, and right joyfully did he undertake them, when, having
crossed to <name type="city">Liverpool</name>, he set sail on the second stage of his
voyage June 24, 1859, touching at <name type="city">Funchal</name>, <placeName>Madiera</placeName>, <placeName>Santa
Cruz</placeName>, <placeName>Teneriffe</placeName> and <placeName>Cape Verde</placeName>, before anchoring in the port.
of <name type="city">Bathurst</name>, <country>Gambia</country>.</p>
   <p>We are indebted to his own account of this memorable

                    <fw> SOME   NOTED   NEGROES                 5</fw>
trip for most of the interesting facts we are able to present.
On his return, he published a brief, but very satisfactory, account 
of the country, the tribes and their customs; an account
that loses none of its interest read by the light of more ambitious 
volumes in these later days when <placeName>Africa</placeName> and everything
African is being examined with a microscope and raked with
a fine-toothed comb.</p>
  <p> Landing at <name type="city">Lagos</name> on the <geogName>Gulf of Guinea</geogName>, after a stay of
some weeks awaiting <abbr type="title">Dr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Martin R. Delaney</rs>, his companion
explorer, in vain, he began his journey inland up the <geogName>Ogun
river</geogName>, having for his first objective the native town of <name type="city">Abbeokuta</name>. 
He was fortunate in making the acquaintance of <abbr type="title">Rev</abbr>.
<rs type="person">Samuel Crowther</rs>, the gifted native preacher and scholar, since
made Bishop of Niger by the Episcopal Church—a man as
brilliant as he is black. The two sons, <rs type="person">Samuel</rs> and <rs type="person">Josiah
Crowther</rs>, decided to accompany <abbr type="title">Prof.</abbr> <rs type="person">Campbell</rs>, and together
they set out. In due time they arrived at <name type="city">Abbeokuta</name> and were
given an audience with the King, who regarded their mission
with great favor.</p>
  <p> A digression which Prof. Campbell makes in his narrative 
is of much interest as showing that the idea that Negroes
always pay more deference to white men <hi rend="italic">because they are
white</hi> than to colored men, is false and the result of slavery
rather than any innate sense of inferiority in the black man.
    On this point, he says:</p>
   <p> <q>"The natives generally at first regarded me as a white
man, until I informed them of my connection with the Negro.
This announcement always gained me a warmer reception."</q>
</p>
<fw>6                      THE REVIEW</fw>
  <p><q> "The reader here will permit me to digress to explain a
matter respecting which there has hitherto been some misconception. 
It has been asserted that the native African does not
manifest under any circumstances the same deference for colored 
men as he does for white men; and so fully is this believed, 
particularly in the United States, that both my colleague, 
<abbr type="title">Dr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Delaney</rs>, and myself were frequently cautioned
respecting the danger to which we should be exposed in consequence 
of our complexion. It is indeed true that more respect 
has been accorded to white men, on account of their superior 
learning and intelligence, than to the generality of semicivilized
 Mack men from the Brazils and other places, who
now live in the <placeName>Aku</placeName> country; but it is a great mistake to think
that the same is withheld from colored men similarly endowed
with their white brethren. Let any disinterested person visiting 
Abcokuta place himself in a position to notice the manner
in which such a person, for instance, as the Reverend <rs type="person">Samuel
Crowther</rs>, or even his son of the same name, each a pure Negro, 
is treated, and he would soon perceive the profound respect 
with which Africans treat those of their own race worthy
of it. The white man who supposes himself respected in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, 
merely because he is white, is grievously mistaken. I
have had opportunities to know, that if he should, presuming
on his complexion, disregard propriety in his bearing towards
the authorities, he would receive as severe rebuke as a similar
offense would bring him in <country>England</country>. One of the chiefs of
<name type="city">Abbeokuta</name>, Atambala, was with us. one day when a young
missionary entered and passed him with only a casual nod of

                  <fw>   SOME NOTED  NEGROES                     7</fw>
the head. As soon as he was seated the haughty old chief
arose and said, in his own tongue: 'Young man, whenever any
of my people, even the aged, approaches me, he prostrates himself 
with his face to the ground. I do not expect the same
from you or from civilized men, (oyibo), nevertheless remember 
always that I shall demand all the respect due to a chief of
Abbeokuta. A sufficient apology was given, and the matter
ended, not without, it is hoped, teaching a salutary lesson."</q></p>
   <p>This incident gives us an insight into the distorting effects 
of slavery. Men who have seen white enthroned and
made the standard of all excellence learn to depreciate, if not
despise, black; which, indeed, was the aim of those who deprived 
their fellow-men of God-given liberty. It is a travesty
upon reason and good judgment to distort and deform a human 
being's conceptions by a false system of training and then
point to the resulting product as the outcome of <q>"race traits
and tendencies;"</q> yet this is exactly what American opinion
does.</p>
   <p>Possibly no question has been more hotly debated than
the Negro's ability of self-government. The Reconstruction
regime is always put to do service to demonstrate his inability;
but Professor <rs type="person">Campbell</rs> found a degree of social and political
efficiency among the Aku nation, of whom the Egbas form a
part, that was truly wonderful. Besides, it had the rare
merit of being indigenous to Africa, thus discrediting another
stock explanation of whatever merit Americans see in a Negro
—that of <q>"mere power to imitate."</q></p>

<fw>8                         THE REVIEW</fw>
  <p> Professor Campbell informs us that—
   <q>"Viewed as to its power of enforcing order, and affording 
security for life and property, the government of Abbeo
kuta is as efficient as a civilized government can be, and it 
accomplishes these ends with the greatest ease and simplicity.
Punishment is always summary and certain; notwithstanding,
nobody complains of injustice. The penalty for theft is extreme, 
being either decapitation or foreign slavery. Before
the advent of missionaries and civilized people adultery was
sometimes also a capital offense; now it is modified to heavy-
fines, the amount of which is always proportioned to the position 
and wealth of the offender. Cases of adultery often occur, 
and must be expected until they are taught to abandon
the disgusting system of polygamy.</q></p>
   <p><q>"The tenure of property is as it is among civilized people,
except as to land, which is deemed common property; every
individual enjoys the right of taking unoccupied land, <hi rend="italic">as much
as he can use</hi>, wherever and whenever he pleases. It is deemed
his property as long as he keeps it in use; after that, it is
again common property. This custom is observed by all the
Alois.</q></p>
  <p> <q>"The surviving relatives of one buried on any lot of
ground have a right to that ground, which nothing can tempt
them to relinquish, and from respect to the sentiment, no one
would invade on any pretext, particularly when the deceased 
was a mother or father. <abbr type="title">Mr.</abbr> <rs type="person">S. Crowther, Jr.</rs>, has long desired 
to possess a strip of land contiguous to his place of business,

it, although he is very poor; because his father lies buried
there."</q></p>
   <p>Surely, here is the source of <rs type="person">Henry George</rs>'s single tax
theory which is intended to take from a man all idle land,
leaving him only as much as he can use profitably; yet observe
how filial regard, and respect for the dead, make a beautiful
exception to the general law in <placeName>Africa</placeName> by setting apart forever
burial grounds. Nothing quite like it can be found outside of
<country>China</country>, where veneration for parents approaches ancestor worship. 
Certainly <placeName>America</placeName>, which runs a street right over the
bones of a hero to make way for traffic, cannot match it.</p>
   <p>A little further on, our author gives us an amusing instance 
of that universal jealousy that seems to exist among
physicians of every race and kind. The sprightly recital cannot 
be improved upon. Says he:
   <q>"There are many doctors—physicians, I might have said—throughout 
the Aku country; and they are as jealous of their
profession, and as opposed to innovation in practice as the most
orthodox disciple of <rs type="person">Aesculapius</rs> amongst us can be. Shortly
after the return of <abbr type="title">Mr.</abbr> <rs type="title">S. Crowther, Jr.</rs>, from <name type="city">London</name>, where
he received the training of a surgeon, several of these doctors,
hearing that he was prescribing for many who were before
their patients, assembled <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> in the market place, and after 
due deliberation issued an "injunction" that he should
forthwith abandon his practice. Some of the foremost of them
were deputed to communicate the decree of the faculty. They
were cordially received and heard with patience. After some
conversation, Mr. C. informed them that, he was willing to

<fw>10                        THE REVIEW</fw>
obey, but only after a trial on both sides should prove him to
be the less skilled in the mysteries of the profession To this
they consented. Time was given for preparation on both
sides. In the afternoon the regulars appeared, clothed in their
most costly garments, and well provided with orishas or charms
attached to all parts of their persons and dress. In the meantime 
<abbr type="title">Mr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Crowther</rs> had also prepared to receive them. A table
was placed in the middle of the room and on it a dish in which
were a few drops of sulphuric acid, so placed that a slight motion 
of the table would cause it to flow into a mixture of chlorate of 
potassa and white sugar. A clock was also in the room,
from which a small bird issued every hour and announced the
time by cooing. This was arranged so as to coo while they
were present. <abbr type="title">Mr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Crowther</rs> then made a brief harangue, and
requested them to say who should lead off in the contest. This
privilege they accorded to him. The door was closed, the curtains 
drawn down. All waited in breathless expectation.
Presently the bird came out, and to their astonishment cooed
twelve times, and suddenly from the midst of the dish burst
forth flame and a terrible explosion. The scene that followed
was indescribable; one fellow rushed through the window and
scampered; another in his consternation overturning chairs.
tables and everything in his way, took refuge in the bedroom, 
under the bed, from which he was with difficulty after
wards removed. It need not be added that they gave no more
trouble, and the practice they sought to break up was only the
more increased for their pains."</q></p>
   <p><abbr type="title">Prof.</abbr> <rs type="person">Campbell</rs>, pursuing the purpose for which he was

               <fw>SOME  NOTED NEGROES                       11</fw>
sent out, collected much valuable information about the form
of government, the grades of native officials, native food and
cooking, clothing, skill in iron working, shrewdness in trade,
native notions of honor, slavery, polygamy, military genius and
funeral rites. In almost all of these specifications he shows
the innate ability, ingenuity and initiative of the African who
had not come in contact with Caucasian instruction. The
whole showing is in disagreement with American ideas.</p>
   <p>Those readers interested in philological investigation are
told of the richness of the Aku vocabulary. In methods of
salutation alone they have more than a score of words. For
instance:
   <q>"Equals meeting will simply say, <hi rend="italic">acu</hi>; but one addressing
a superior affixes some word to <hi rend="italic">acu</hi>, thus, <hi rend="italic">acabo</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">acu abo</hi>*)
<hi rend="italic">acuni</hi>, etc. The superior usually salutes first, and when the
disparity of position is great, the inferior prostrates. The
young always prostrate to the aged. Women kneel, but never 
prostrate. Sons, without reference to age or rank, prostrate
to their mothers or senior female relatives. They never suffer
anything to interfere with the observance of these courtesies.
There is an appropriate salutation for every occasion; for instance: 
<hi rend="italic">acuaro</hi>, good morning; <hi rend="italic">acuale</hi>, good evening; <hi rend="italic">acushe</hi>,
for being industrious; <hi rend="italic">acabo</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">acuabo</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">ua</hi> as diphthong),
for returning from a journey; acatijo, for long absence; <hi rend="italic">acujoco</hi>, 
for sitting or resting; <hi rend="italic">acudaro</hi>, for standing or walking;
<hi rend="italic">acuraju</hi>, expressive of sympathy, in distress or sickness; <hi rend="italic">acuero</hi>, 
for bearing a burthen; <hi rend="italic">acualejo</hi>, for entertaining a stranger.

<fw>12                        THE REVIEW</fw>
So rich is the language in salutations, that the above list could
have been increased indefinitely."</q></p>
   <p>So great a variety in the language of politeness would
indicate a Chesterfieldian people, and truly it is so, for we are
informed that not even a Frenchman is more polite than these
untaught Africans. Even two strangers never pass without
saluting, and the most scrupulous attention is paid to the social
position of persons saluted. An old man, whose age and position 
as selector of the successor to the king entitled him, by
native custom, to require the prostration of all who came into
his presence, refused to allow the king to pay this act of deference; 
but the king insisted. Then began what must have
been a most amusing contest between the two, each seeking,
on every meeting, to approach the other unawares and prostrate 
himself first.</p>
   <p>They could frequently be seen stealthily creeping upon
each other, hiding behind bushes or huts, to be the first to
throw themselves on the ground before each other.</p>
   <p>After gathering much valuable data for the General
Board of Commissioners who had sent him out, and pushing
his explorations as far inland as Ilorin, notwithstanding serious 
hindrances from native wars, Professor <rs type="person">Campbell</rs> reached
<name type="city">Liverpool</name> on his return <date when="1890-05-12">May 12, 1860</date>, having been from home
about one year.</p>

session of the International Statistical Congress, over which

<rs type="person">A. B. Longstreet</rs>, delegate from Georgia, retired in high
dudgeon because <abbr type="title">Dr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Delaney</rs> was seated on the platform, a
fact to which Lord <rs type="person">Brougham</rs> called admiring attention.</p>
   <p>It will be remembered that the General Board of Commissioners 
who sent out Professor <rs type="person">Campbell</rs> and <abbr type="title">Dr.</abbr> <rs type="person">Delaney</rs>
disclaimed any intention of encouraging or arranging for emigration 
to <placeName>Africa</placeName>, yet after having made the exploration Professor 
<rs type="person">Campbell</rs> announced his intention to make <placeName>Africa</placeName> his
home. In the wisdom of this course both of the explorers
agreed. Indeed, they proceeded to negotiate a treaty with
the tribes they visited, stipulating four things:
   1.  The kings and chiefs agreed to grant them on behalf
of the African race in <placeName>America</placeName>, the right of settling in any
part of their unoccupied territory.
   2.  These settlers were to be governed by their own laws
and customs.
   3.  The settlers were to have <q>"intelligence, education, a
knowledge of the arts and sciences, agriculture, and other
mechanical and industrial occupations, which they shall put
into immediate operation by improving the lands and in other
useful vocations."</q>
   4.  The laws of the natives were to be respected, and
matters of dispute between natives and settlers were to be settled 
by commissioners equally chosen.</p>
   <p>These few glimpses of Professor <rs type="person">Robert Campbell</rs> show
him to have been a very capable man in his chosen field of
science, observant as a traveler and entitled to some rating as
to statesmanship. Certainly, his love and loyalty for the
Negro stood out above all else.</p>

   <p>We regard war between this country and <country>Japan</country> as pretty sure to
come, though how long delayed no one can say, of course. Our reason for
expecting it is that, notwithstanding the object lesson of military capability 
<country>Japan</country> has given, there is a compartment of obtuseness in the average
Caucasian mind that prevents their profiting by, or acting on, information 
impressed upon another compartment. In other words, the American
mind is like the American Government in that one part need not obey the
other unless it wants to do so. Thus the <region>State of California</region> can plunge
the nation into war and the nation cannot make <region>California</region> quit. So much,

       <head>THE NEGRO SEER: HIS PREPARATION AND MISSION.</head>
               
   <p>I am glad I am not an ox. With Terence, I say, "I am
a man." Man is just a little lower than the angels. He carries 
the impress of divinity; is differentiated from other animals 
by the moral element, the faculty of reason, and a superior 
mentality which is capable of a marvelous development.
These characteristics belong to every variety of the human
race. Nevertheless, in 1861, at <name type="city">Savannah</name>, <region>Georgia</region>, Senator
<rs type="person">A. H. <sic>Stevens</sic></rs> declared that the foundations of the Confederacy 
<q>"are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that
the Negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery—subordination 
to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition."</q></p>
   <p>Beginning with Count <rs type="person">Gobineau</rs>, in 1854, a small school
of anthropologists have undertaken to prove that, by the fiat
of God, there are inferior and superior branches of the human
race. These savants base their arguments upon cephalometry,
orthognathism, that is, measurements of the head, the face,
the jaws, etc. They measure the nose. The longer the nose
the more he knows. The flatter the nose the less he knows.
They measure the height, the breast, the ear, the feet. They

                    <fw> THE NEGRO SEER                       157</fw>
note his color, his eyes, his smell. They bring to their aid
arguments physiological, pathological, psychological. They
argue for polygenesis, denying monogenesis of the human
race. Hence, they have engendered race friction, race hatred,
between the white and the brown, and the black, and often
between branches of the same color. This hatred is one time
turned against the Jews, another, against the Japanese, or
again, against the Negro.</p>
   <p>The causes of the variations in the different branches of
the human race are many and apparent. Action of climate,
diseases, nourishment, mode of life, the whole environment,
the <hi rend="italic">milieu</hi>, as the French would say, are causes of race variation. 
We now know that in Africa there are all kinds of
colors and hair depending upon the environment. The Scandinavian, 
living among his snow-capped hills, is almost colorless. 
The Antisians of Peru, living at the point of rocks, beneath 
a forest impenetrable to the rays of the sun, are whiter
than those of their own blood about them. We are affected
by our geological habitat. As the minerals and moisture of
certain soils produce a small, scrubby forest, so "a granite and
sterile soil producing only rye, buckwheat, potatoes, and
chestnuts" produces a people remarkable for their narrow
shoulders, tight chests, lymphatic temperament. Potassium,
iron, magnesia, lime, sulphur, arsenic, the rays of the sun,
the winds, the forests, the rivers, all affect our size, color,
nose, head, feet, chest, temperament.</p>
   <p>There are to-day, we are told, men of purest Jewish blood
    5

<fw>158                     THE REVIEW</fw>
whose color is the whitest of the white, the brownest of the
brown, the blackest of the black. A careful study of science
and history indicates that the centuries to come will produce
a typical American whose color will be red.</p>
   <p>But moral influence has greatest effect in producing race
variety. <rs type="person">Norton</rs> tells us that Negro children born in liberty
have more beautiful eyes, a more elegant appearance, and an
easier bearing.</p>
   <p>The arguments for the unity of the race are many and
convincing. The blood of a dog injected into the veins of a
Frenchman will destroy the one or both. The blood of a
Negro or Jap may be injected into a Frenchman's veins with
impunity. <rs type="person">Liebnitz</rs>, <rs type="person">Blumenbach</rs>, <rs type="person">Agassiz</rs>, <rs type="person">Finot</rs>, all the leading 
anthropologists of the world, tell us that there is but one
human race. No two black-eyed peas are alike and yet they
are peas.  The babies of all races cry alike.</p>
   <p>There are forward and backward branches of the race
caused by environment But will the backward always remain 
backward? The Japs were backward sixty years ago.
Are they backward to-day?</p>
   <p>The Negro is a branch of the human race, and has, therefore, 
inherently, all the capabilities of the other branches. This
is attested by the achievements of many Negroes of purest
blood. <rs type="person">John C Calhoun</rs> once said: <q>"If I could find a Negro
who knew Greek Syntax, I would believe the Negro was a
huma being and ought to be treated as a man."</q> To-day, in
response to the promise of such distinguished consideration,

             <fw>          THE NEGRO SEER                      159</fw>
we can present an overwhelming array of scholars, publicists,
generals, etc. There were <rs type="person">Clitus</rs>, the black general of the
army of <rs type="person">Alexander the Great</rs>; <rs type="person">Phillis Wheatly</rs>, the little African 
girl, whose poetry extorted praise from General <rs type="person">George
Washington</rs>; <rs type="person">Benjamin Banneker</rs>, the astronomer and friend
of  <rs type="person">Thomas Jefferson</rs>; Congressman <rs type="person">R. B. Elliot</rs>; <rs type="person">J. C. Price</rs>,
the orator; <rs type="person">Edward W. Blyden</rs>, whom Europe regards as one
of the greatest scholars of the world; <rs type="person">J. W. E. Bowen</rs>, the
theologian; <rs type="person">M. C. B. Mason</rs>, the publicist; <rs type="person">Dunbar</rs>, the poet;
<rs type="person">Toussaint L. Ouverture</rs>, the warrior; several distinguished
men wearing the honor of knighthood conferred by <rs type="person">Queen
Victoria</rs>, and legions of others.</p>
 <p>  But you say these are of purest Negro blood; the crossbreed, 
the mulatto, the octaroon, is a failure, weakling physically 
and mentally. Where are the distinguished mixed
bloods? Here they are: <rs type="person">Ishmael</rs>, son of <rs type="person">Abraham</rs> by
<rs type="person">Hagar</rs>; <rs type="person">Menelek</rs>, son of <rs type="person">Solomon</rs> and the African <rs type="person">Queen of
Sheba</rs>; <rs type="person">Alexander Dumas</rs>, the French novelist; <rs type="person">Robert
Browning</rs>, the English poet; <rs type="person">Poushkin</rs>, Russia's greatest poet;
<rs type="person">Ira Aldridge</rs>, the actor; <rs type="person">Sainte-George</rs>, the first vice-president
of the French Deputies; a President each of <country>Bolivia</country>, <country>Venezuela</country>, 
and <country>Mexico</country>; <rs type="person">H. O. Tanner</rs>, who as artist is the wonder of Europe; 
<rs type="person">Edmonia Lewis</rs>, the sculpturess; <rs type="person">Fred Douglass</rs>, America's greatest 
orator; <rs type="person"><sic>W. E. D.</sic> DuBois</rs>, <rs type="person">Booker T. Washington</rs>, and <rs type="person">Alexander 
Hamilton</rs>, America's great statesman, and greatest financier!</p>
   <p>Now, this argument is not made in advocacy of amalgamation; 

<fw>160                        THE REVIEW</fw>
but it is made to show that whether amalgamation or
not, every man, of every branch of the human race, of every
color, who wears the mark of divinity, apart from external 
influences, is inherently as good as any other man. Nor is this
trying to run away from the Negro race. It is the proper exaltation 
of the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> of whatever human variety.</p>
   <p>I have never believed a Negro was superior to the white
man—never! I have never believed the Japanese was superior 
to the Englishman—never.</p>
   <p><q>"Noble blood, bah! What blood is more noble, or so
pure as that of the lion ? And yet he is only a brute. It is
merit, education, virtue, not blood, that lifts men above the
level of the brutes!"</q></p>
   <p>So we may conclude that the Negro scholar, the Negro Seer, 
has <hi rend="italic">inherently</hi> all the possibilities possessed by any other
branch of the human race.</p>
   <p>The world despises a weakling, a coward. Effort is
necessary to growth.   As <rs type="person">Robert Browning</rs> says:

      <q>"No. When the fight begins within himself,
       A man's worth something, God looks o'er his head.
       Satan looks up between his feet—both tug—
       He's left himself i' the middle; the soul awakes
       And grows. Prolong that battle his life."</q></p>

   <p>Great financial enterprises gravitate about thinkers. The
progress of the world regulates its footsteps by the pulse-beats
of the thinker. The X-Ray by which we see the lungs of the
living, the ship in which we sail in mid-heaven, wireless telegraphy 
by which we send our messages through the trackless

                   <fw>THE NEGRO SEER                         161</fw>
air, the submarine boat in which we fight our battles beneath
the waters—these are matters of grey-matter.</p>
   <p>There are no mergers in scholarship. The trusts may
control the landscape, but not the beauty of the flowers. No
legislative enactment can control aesthetic taste, noble feeling,
high thinking, honest effort.</p>
   <p><rs type="person">Benjamin Hill</rs>, Senator from Georgia, is reported to have
remarked that twenty ordinary white men are worth more to
civilization than all the Negroes who have lived in the last
six thousand years. The remark is not true, but is indicative
of a prevalent feeling in many quarters. We are being weighed
in the balances. The test is rigid and exacting. We must
stand up or fall down. We must run or get off the track.
There is no mercy, no quarter. We ask no quarter. All we
want is a fair chance to run. Let us prepare for the contest.
In our preparation we must understand that <hi rend="italic">right will ultimately 
win</hi>. Might is no longer right. Right is right. The <rs>King of Belgium</rs> 
is responsible to all the world for the horrors
of the <country>Congo</country>. <country>Russia</country> must answer to the world for the horrors 
of <name type="city">Kishinev</name>. Individuals and nations are accountable to
the, <q>"parliament of man, the federation of the world." </q></p>

       <p><q>"Truth crushed to earth will rise again,
          The eternal years of God are hers;
        But error, wounded, writhes in pain,
          And  dies among his worshippers."</q></p>

   <p>No man ever followed the path of virtue in vain. Men
and nations ultimately get what they deserve. There is power
in goodness. Greatness is goodness. Goodness wins. Character 

<fw>162                      THE REVIEW</fw>
tells. Character compels. If this be true, <hi rend="italic">God, the source
of all goodness</hi>, should hold first place in our preparation.
What God wills finally triumphs in history. God is not ancient history. 
Was is the wrong, tense for God. God is. God works to-day in the hearts 
of individuals, in the universe.</p>
   <p>As President <rs type="person">Hyde</rs> says: <q>"The man who makes the will of
God the basis of his character and the motive of his conduct,
carries with him the germ of Christianity; for this principle,
rightly apprehended, covers the whole life. The man who
has it will be kind and considerate in his home, upright and
honest in his work, public spirited in civic and political relations, 
socially courteous and sincere, sympathetic with the suffering, 
generous to the poor, helpful to the weak. On the
other hand, he will resist oppression, expose hypocrisy, denounce 
injustice, rebuke fraud, fight for timely and rational
reform. He will do these things whether they are profitable
or costly, popular or unpopular; whether they bring thanks
or curses, praise or blame; whether men strew his path with
palms and hail him with hosannas, or crown him with thorns
and nail him to the cross."</q> We live to make others richer,
happier, better; to elevate the beautiful, to enthrone truth.
<q>"Thus the person who has grown up through faithful doing
of the right into loving devotion to the good, finds every place
a holy place, every bush upon the roadside ablaze with God,
every circumstance, where duty can be done and good can be
accomplished, a gateway to heaven, an approach to the throne
of the Most High!"</q></p>

   <p>The love of God embraces <hi rend="italic">the altruistic spirit</hi>. Our
courses of study should be such that no one should receive a
diploma from any college unless the sweep of his love takes in
all men. Hate kills; kills the hater more than the hated.
Love ennobles; ennobles the lover more than the loved. Some
one has said: <q>"I love a good hater."</q> That's wrong. The
world loves a good lover.</p>
   <p><rs type="person">Jesus</rs> is the incarnation of altruistic love. His character
shall ultimately fill the whole earth; dominate every interest.
Him we should love. Him we should study. We study the
life of <rs type="person">Washington</rs>. We should study the life of Jesus more.
Washington ruled a small segment of the human race.</p>

       <p><q>"Jesus shall reign wher'er the sun,
        Doth his successive journeys run;
        His   kingdoms   spread   from   shore to shore,
        Till moons shall wax and wane no more."</q></p>

   <p>We should cut out of our vocabulary such words as
<q>"sheeny,"</q><q> "dago,"</q> <q>"hill billy,"</q><q> "poor buckra,"</q><q> "nigger,"</q> etc.
They are not fit expressions of a scholar and a gentleman.

   <p>The prophets of evil, of racial wars, the fomentors of discontent,

   <p>The <name type="city">Atlanta</name> riot will be an exception. Ex-Governor
<rs type="person">Northen</rs>, a committee of noble white and colored men are getting 
together to prevent another calamity like that one. Soon
the better angel in all of us will be aroused. Hence, I look
to the future with joyous anticipation. This nation will not
be destroyed in hatred by fire, and shot and shell. Too much
love and mercy and Christ abound.</p>
   <p>We should seek peace between the white and black people
of our country. Peace is essential to mental, spiritual, and
material growth. Without peace all is lost. Why should not
the whites and blacks exercise a little common sense and treat
each other right? That is what we must do and will do.
Racial conditions in the South furnish a splendid opportunity
to test the greatness of the white race. The Greeks secured
liberty to the Greeks; all others to them were barbarians.
The Romans secured liberty to the Romans; all others were
despised. The white American can prove himself superior
to the Greek and the Roman, can prove his religion superior
only if he is strong enough to treat with absolute justice the
backward, undeveloped black man. The black man should
see to it that no blame attaches to him. He sould deserve the
best, be worthy a man's treatment. If he does this, there are

                     <fw>THE NEGRO SEER                        165</fw>
evidences that the white man will give him a man's chance.</p>
   <p>The positive evidence of the sincere friendship of the
white South for the black man is attested by such distinguished
Southern white men as <abbr type="title">Prof.</abbr> <rs type="person">Edgar Gardner Murphy</rs>, who
says: "The educational policy of a genuine patriotism will include 
all the children of the unprivileged, white as well as
black." By Bishop <rs type="person">C. B. Galloway</rs>, who says: <q>"We must
insist that the Negro have equal opportunity with every American 
citizen to fulfill in himself the highest purposes of an all-
wise and beneficent Providence." . . . "Indisputable facts
attest the statement that education and its attendant influences
have elevated the standard and tone of morals among the Negroes 
in the South."</q> By ex-Congressman <rs type="person">Fleming</rs>, of <region>Georgia</region>, who says: 
<q>"Let us solve the Negro problem by giving the
Negro justice and applying to him the recognized principles of
the moral law. This does not require social equality. It does
not require that we should surrender into his inexperienced and
incompetent hands the reins of political government. But it
does require that we recognize his fundamental rights as a man,
and that we judge each individual according to his own qualifications, 
and not according to the lower average characteristics of his race. 
Political rights can not justly be withheld
from those American citizens of an inferior or backward race
who raise themselves up to the standard of citizenship which
the superior race applies to its own members."</q></p>
   <p>In our preparation, we must remember that while we may
not approve race discrimination, it is nevertheless a valuable

<fw>166                          THE REVIEW</fw>
asset. If we cannot get a sleeper, we must rough it, discipline
our temper, harden our character, and save our money. The
refusal of a clerk to fit shoes on a colored girl was the cause
of a prosperous shoe store run by Negroes. The refusal to
rent to Negroes was the cause of the organization of the Metropolitan 
Mercantile and Realty Company of New York, whose
assets run into thousands. The protest against Negro writers
in the Sunday-school literature of the Baptist Publication Society 
caused the organization of the Negro Baptist Publication
Society. It is a fine, exhilerating, strenuous job to be a Negro.
Our white friends ought to try it awhile. One month would
do.  It is calculated to bring out the best in a man.

       <q>"Sweet are the uses of adversity,
        Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
        Wears yet a precious jewel in his head."</q></p>

   <p>In our preparation there should be the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> of <hi rend="italic">sacrifice</hi>.
The Roman exclaimed: <hi rend="italic"><q>"Dulce et decorum est pro patria
mori.”</q></hi> It should be sweet to us to sacrifice for our people.
We should cry with Knox, <q>"Lord, give me Scotland or I die."</q>
We cannot give our millions like Carnegie, but we can do more
important service—we can give ourselves, our love, our
thought, our spirit. Says <rs type="person">Carlyle</rs>: <q>"It is only with renunciation 
that life, properly speaking, can be said to begin. . . .
In a valiant suffering for others, not in a slothful making others
suffer for us, did nobleness ever lie."</q> This is all comprehended 
in the words of <rs type="person">Jesus</rs>, <q>"Whosoever will come after Me, let
him deny himself."</q></p>
   <p>The building of happy homes is the next mission. The

                     <fw>THE NEGRO SEER                      167</fw>
most serious mistake of the Negro to-day is his failure to buy
land.The only fixed and stable citizens of any country are
the land owners. We should buy land anywhere, everywhere,
much or little, rich or poor, and when we get it, keep it. Get
a lot, a few acres, or many acres. On it build a home. Beautify 
the house, plant flowers, set out an orchard, paint the
fence, adorn that house with a few good books; found it
upon honesty, truthfulness, cheerfulness, sobriety, family
prayer, the sweet songs of <placeName>Zion</placeName>; let <rs type="person">Jesus</rs> be the constant unseen 
guest; let love of a dear mother, of a precious wife, of 
innocent, prattling, smiling children sanctify that home; let
patience, tenderness and mercy guide it; let filial love and
parental affection guard its threshold, and you have laid the
foundation of a prosperous and great people. Be it remembered, 
too, that the happiest homes are not always the richest.
The happiest homes are those where dwell love, harmony, kindness, 
unselfishness. Riches? What is mother worth? Don't
you remember when she tucked the cover under your feet at
night, made the tea for you when you were sick, followed you
to the gate when you left home the last time? Riches? What
would you take for that smiling, chirping baby? And wife?
She is the best wife, encourages you, meets you with a smile,
helps bear your burdens. Ah, that is love. That is life.
Here prosperity has its tap root!</p>
   <p>The proper rearing and training of our youth is an important 
essential. We begin to educate our children one hundred 
and twenty years before they are born. The sins of the

<fw>168                  THE REVIEW</fw>
parents are visited upon the children unto the third and fourth
generations. Train carefully, drill constantly the chiild in the
path of rectitude, in its formative period, and when it is old,
it will not depart from the proper path.</p>
   <p>There is a woeful neglect of our youth to-day. It is
amazing that any of our young people master the forces of
evil that would drag them down.</p>
   <p><rs type="person">Luther <sic>Burbanks</sic></rs>, the artisan of the vegetable world, by
tender, thoughtful care, year in and year out, has produced
the pomato from the potato and tomato; has made the rough,
thorny cactus, thornless and edible; has changed the character
of plants whose wretched odor has been offensive for six thousand 
years, into a perfume, the sweetest of the sweet. In
fact, from a lower order of plant life, by diligent care, he is
producing an order of nobility in the plant world. Do our
parents care thus for their children? A mother artist has a
tender flower upon her veranda. Three times a day she waters
it, nurses it, watches it. How she loves it! It blooms. She
calls in her neighbors. How they rejoice! But her own
darling son, blood of her blood, flesh of her flesh, within him
an immortal soul—does she care for him? Does she pray
with him three times a day? Does she till the soil in which
he grows ? Does she take him to Sunday-school and church
with her until he is twenty-one? Does she know where he is
on Sunday? And the daughter—I pity the Negro girl with
beautiful form and face. I must enter this field in auphemistic 
terms.   Often without the watchful care of father or mother 

                      <fw>THE NEGRO SEER                      169</fw>
she is hounded from pillar to post by demons. Notwithstanding 
her temptations, the average girl is permitted to go
about to parties, moonlight picnics, or excursions, church suppers, 
without father or mother, or chaperone. She is too often
kicked about like a foot-ball. To get our mothers and fathers
to hold tight rein upon their children, to regulate the relation
of our boys and girls and our young men and women, in fine,
to give a proper conception of what it means to rear children—this 
is the mission of the scholar, the seer of the race. Unless
we rear our children properly in the home, put them in the
public schools, bring them into the folds of the Sunday-school
and the church, and keep them at profitable, honest labor of
some kind, on the farms, or in the shops, somewhere, anywhere, 
and hold them there until their character is hardened
in principles of duty and righteousness, sad, sad will be their
future. To do this is a task worthy of our best thought, our
best efforts. It involves the divorce question, the sanctity of
marriage ties. This is the main remedy for vagrancy and
criminality. Some say we need a better class of young people.
I say we need a better class of fathers and mothers. The
remedy is a matter of slow growth, of character building.
We must make better men and better women, and then we
shall have less criminality.</p>
   <p>Our people should be taught their civic duties. We
should have pride in our city, county, state, nation. Every
question that affects the weal of our country should concern us.
We are a part of this government. Those who would make

<fw>170                      THE REVIEW</fw>
us pariahs, aliens, outcasts, and disfranchise us are doomed
finally to failure. We are either citizens or not. If citizens,
we must ultimately be permitted to vote, and help elect our
rulers. Sin against any part of our legal citizens will rebound
on the sinner. If the Negro proves worthy the ballot, in self
defense, the dominant party will be compelled to permit him
to vote or else they should burn, up the Constitution of the
Nation. Taxation without representation is no better for the
white man than the Negro. If the Negro population is good
enough to be counted to determine the representation in our
National Congress, it is good enough to help choose that representation. 
This principle will yet win. Hypocrisy and double-dealing 
by the nation cannot live. Hence we look to the
future with a patriotic, abiding faith in our government, with
deep interest in good roads, deep water, purity of the ballot.
Every Negro should pay his taxes. He should be interested
in ail reform movements. He should hold at every possible
opportunity an unpurchasable ballot to be cast for the good of
his country.</p>
   <p>In a recent local option campaign, it was said,<q> "Let the
local optionists speak, sing and pray; we will carry the election. 
We can buy the niggers."</q> Any man who will sell his
blood-stained ballot for any price whatever is not fit to vote,
and should be disfranchised. This doctrine should be preached
from every hill-top.</p>
   <p>We should bear a man's share of the burden of government.   
We should help to make our government pure by first

                    <fw>THE NEGRO SEER                        171</fw>
being pure ourselves. Our influence should be ever against
the saloon, the king-devil of all evils, the worst enemy of the
human race.</p>
   <p>Then our vision and interest should sweep out and take
in world movements. Whatever concerns mankind concerns
us. No man can grow large whose interest does not go beyond 
his own roof-tree. Trembling <name type="city">San Francisco</name>, or starving 
<country>China</country> should find a place in our helpful sympathy. We
rise only as we lift others up. Love increases by loving. The
continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName> should be of deepest interest to every
thoughtful Negro. We need <placeName>Africa</placeName> as much as <placeName>Africa</placeName> needs

                <head>THE LOCOMOTIVE IN CENTRAL AFRICA.</head>
   <p>The work that the African Methodist Church is seeking to do in
<placeName>Africa</placeName>, no less than natural affinity, makes any item or occurrence 
connected with that remarkable land eagerly read by the patrons of the A.
M. E. Review. A few years ago there, was little besides adventures with
wild beasts and wilder men to thrill our blood, but to-day the story of the
rapid advance of civilization and its agents, the railroad and telegraph,
is a far more wonderful one than <rs type="person">Stanley</rs> told when he returned from
finding <rs type="person">Livingstone</rs>. It is this that makes the following recital from an
exchange correspondent so absorbing and so informing:</p>
  <p> In the heart of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, 1700 miles from: <geogName>the Atlantic</geogName>, a little band of
white men, not 200 in all, direct the labors of 5000 negroes in one of the
most remarkable conquests of nature to the credit of civilization. They
press forward step by step, clearing the tropical forests and surveying the
land, throwing up embankments and laying the ties and steel rails of an
iron highway as they go. In front is a country rich in gold and copper and
the diamond fields of the Transvaal. Behind them are 1400 miles of railroad 
and waterway which nine years ago were veiled in the mystery of
<rs type="person">Stanley</rs>'s <q>"Darkest Africa."</q> The scream of the locomotive pierces the
jungles where lions and leopards had their lairs and droves of wild elephants
stripped the palm trees for their yellow fruit. Telephone bells
wrangle with gray parrots. Churning steamboat wheels invade the dwelling
places of hippopotami among the reeds on the river banks. A saw mill
sings at the spot where <rs type="person">Henry M. Stanley</rs>, 20 years ago, heard the horns,
<fw>   7</fw>
<fw>190                           THE REVIEW</fw>
drums and savage yells of the cannibals and told his men they must go
down the river before them or die.</p>
   <p>The story of this conquest of the jungles of the Dark Continent is so
romantic and amazing and the distances are so vast that this greatest
of romances seems like a dream in a land of dreams. The <placeName>Africa</placeName> of the
school books and history must be cast aside. The story belongs to the last
15 years. Turning to the map of <placeName>Africa</placeName> new divisions appear in the territory 
south of <geogName>the Sahara</geogName>—tableland comprising 5,000,000 square miles, or
1,300,000 square miles more than the area of the <country>United States</country>, <region>Alaska</region> and
our colonial possessions. The conquest of the jungle here related refers 
to the very heart of the Dark Continent under the equator, the 900,000
square miles of the <country>Congo Free State</country>, which, if laid on the map of the
<country>United States</country>, would cover the <placeName>New England</placeName> and <placeName>Middle Atlantic States</placeName>,
and extend westward on parallel lines nearly to the <geogName>Rocky Mountains</geogName>. The
topography of the country at once suggests the more familiar contour of
<country>Mexico</country>. They are alike in the strip of low, unhealthy, tropical forest near
the <geogName>Atlantic</geogName> and beyond the mountain chains, with tablelands between
them.</p>
   <p>The heart of this country was indeed "Darkest Africa when Livingston 
cast the first glimmer of light upon it in 1867. Stanley's journeys
across it in 1874 and 1877 and on the <rs type="person">Emin Pasha</rs> relief expedition of 1887-1888 
are so recent that nearly every one remembers how they set the
white man's world by the ears. <placeName>Africa</placeName> was then to the nineteenth century 
what <placeName>America</placeName> was to the fifteenth—a new <placeName>Eldorado</placeName>, a land of
mysteries and wonders.</p>
   <p>"Without a railway I do not value the <placeName>Congo State</placeName> as worth a dollar,"
declared <rs type="person">Stanley</rs> after one of his visits to the Dark Continent. He knew
of the vast riches in the tableland behind the mountain ranges, which commerce 
could only approach along one highway—the <geogName>Congo River</geogName>. It is
second in the great streams of the world; 2500 miles long and seven miles
wide at its mouth. Only the <geogName>Amazon</geogName> is greater in the volume of water;
only the <geogName>Mississippi</geogName> and <geogName>Missouri</geogName> combined exceed it in length.</p>
   <p>The nation that controlled the <geogName>Congo River</geogName>, said <rs type="person">Stanley</rs>, would be
mistress of <placeName>Central Africa</placeName>. Sailing up this waterway from the <geogName>Atlantic</geogName>,
through no miles of swamp and tropical forest, the trader was halted at
the mountains by a series of cataracts. In all they covered avout 200 miles
of the river's course. When <rs type="person">Stanley</rs> said this vast empire was not worth
a dollar without a railway, he meant that bands of steel must pass these
cataracts and others further up the stream before <placeName>Central Africa</placeName> would be
open to the commerce of the world.</p>
   <p>Could such a railway be built? In the face of the obstacles it seemed
to be an enterprise with insuperable difficulties—still the dream of the 
explorer in the,land of dreams. The white man must conquer marshes and
jungles with their wild beasts and serpents, mountains unknown except by
name, and vast tableland, drenched with rains that bore disease and death
in their train, the poisoned arrows of savages, a thousand miles of open
water, cataracts and jungles again.</p>
   <p><rs type="person">King Leopold, of <country>Belgium</country></rs>, listened and dreamed. Then <rs type="person">Stanley</rs>’s
wonder tales inflamed the imaginations of men, and others dreamed. Their
cupidity was aroused. The world is not so large that such an empire, even
under the equator, can be neglected. <country>England</country>'s policy foreshadowed her
approach to it from the valley of the <geogName>Nile</geogName>. <country>Portugal</country> claimed the land south
of the mouth of the <geogName>Congo</geogName> and <country>France</country> that on the north. Englishmen and
Boers were advancing on the south. The interest aroused by <rs type="person">Stanley</rs>'s tale
terminated in 1885 in the Treaty of Berlin, whereby the <country>Congo Free State</country>
became neutral territory for a number of years.</p>
                              <fw> MISCELLANEOUS                      191</fw>
   <p>By the end of the century, or in a brief two years, the steamers 
numbered 100. The largest of them now has a burden of 500 tons The
waterways of the <country>Congo State</country> have been increased to 9500 miles. Telegraph 
lines, begun in 1892, annihilated 800 miles by 1900. The number of
trading posts increased from 45 in 1882, to over 200 1902; the investments
of commercial capital in the same period from $17,000 to $26,000,000 The
white man found that with temperate habits it was no more difficult to live
on the tableland than in any tropical climate—at <name type="city">New Orleans</name> for example. 
He had planted 2,000,000 coffee bushes and 300,000 cocoanut trees
and had cultivated 5,000,000 india rubber plants by the end of 1902.</p>
   <p>The Belgian Company owning the concession for the railways in the
<country>Congo State</country> intended at first to build the lines toward <country>Egypt</country> and the <geogName>Upper Nile </geogName>
in the northwest. Reports of the riches in gold and copper in the
south, however, determined them to push on in that direction and build
the system of iron highways that is now under way. At <placeName>Stanley Falls</placeName> the
course of the <geogName>Congo River</geogName> turns sharply to the south and a second series
of seven cataracts begins. The railroad that has just been completed circles
these cascades from <name type="city">Stanleyville</name> to <name type="city">Ponthierville</name>, a distance of 75 miles.
The river curves like a bow, and the new railroad may be said to take the
place of the  bowstring.</p>
   <p>How was this iron highway constructed 1400 miles from the sea and
in the very heart of the jungle? When the work was started, on January
26, 1903, only 53 white men—Belgians, Italians, Scandinavians and Swiss 
were available, although the number had been increased to more than 100
by the end of last year. Under them were 3000 black men. The expert
machinists, masons and track builders are negroes who came with their
families from <placeName>West Africa</placeName>. In that region the Negroes who were savages
15 years ago are running locomotives, working in machine shops, building
the Congo steamers and serving as crews on the railroad trains. The
Congo steamboats have as their pilots the Bengala who tried to kill
Stanley.</p>
   <p>These skilled workmen are assisted by apprentices from the Government 
and missionary training schools. The road graders, track layers and
common laborers are Negroes recruited from the neighboring tribes.</p>
   <p>Two hospitals were built in <name type="city">Stanleyville</name> for the railroad men—one for
the whites and the other for the blacks. The danger from smallpox is
always great in <placeName>Central Africa</placeName>, and every one, even to the wives and children 
of the common laborers, was vaccinated with virus from a plant
near <name type="city">Stanleyville</name> supplied with cattle from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. Native policemen were
appointed to maintain order among the laborers. Three physicians accompanied 
the party to regulate the sanitary conditions. Repair shops were
built and prospectors were sent in advance to find clay for the many bricks
which must be used and limestone to be burned into lime for mortar.</p>
   <p>These elaborate preparations ended, the army of 3000-odd, with their
wives and children, set forth to conquer the jungle. They clear the forest
for a short distance, as the engineers survey the land. At once the road-bed 
is graded and the tracks are laid, so that the construction train can be
brought to the very end of the line with earth and materials. No great
difficulties are encountered in making the embankments, as the road passes
through alluvial soil that is free from rock.</p>
   <p>As they advance deeper into the jungle, saw mills are erected, and in
these the Negroes saw the timbers for ties, bridges, and warehouses. The
ties are of bomball trees-the <q>"sham cedar"</q>-a tough durable wood cut
from the neighboring forests. The steel rails are brought from Europe the
freight charges being $2500 for a kilometer of track, or $4160 for a mile.

<fw>192                             THE REVIEW</fw>
This expense raised the; cost of the Stanleyville-Ponthierville road to 
between $15,000 and $20,000 a kilometer, or from $25,000 to $33,300 a mile.</p>
  <p> Now and again a stream is reached. It is bridged! with rude timbers
at first, these being replaced by structures of masonry and steel. As the
army advances, step by step, the telephone goes with them, the wires to
Stanleyville being fastened to the trees or to steel rails set upright in the
ground. After the telephone comes the permanent telegraph.</p>
   <p>The wives and children of the Negroes advance with their husbands
and fathers. In a few hours cabins of palm leaves and grass can be built
close to the tracks. They supply all the shelter the climate requires. Thus
the black men live in little tribal villages, moving forward from time to
time as the railroad advances.</p>
   <p>This battle with the jungle lasted three years. The railway around the
second series of cataracts to <name type="city">Ponthierville</name> was opened for traffic on September 
1 last. It was equipped with 14 locomotives and 124 cars. Steam-
boats were launched above the second cataracts and steamed south to
<name type="city">Kindu</name>, along the 186 miles of waterway that had been opened' to them.</p>
   <p>At <name type="city">Kindu</name> another line of railroad was started at once to Buli, 180
miles distant, around the third and last series of cataracts in the river.
Here 16b white men and 5000 Negroes are pressing forward through the
jungle toward the gold and copper ore and the diamond mines of the
Transvaal.</p>
   <p>The vast riches of the Dark Continent thus being laid bare tax the
credulity. The mind can scarcely grasp the meaning of 2,000,000 square
miles of forest, much of it ebony, teak and mahogany, that stretch from
<geogName>Sahara</geogName> to the Cope coal fields more than 1000 miles long, and some of the
richest iron and copper deposits in the world. On the Congo plateau
$8,000,000 worth of rubber is produced every year, not to mention coffee
and tobacco growing wild, pineapples, rice, bananas, corn and cotton flourishing 
in a soil as rich as that on the Lower Mississippi. In the light of
these facts it may well be understood why the stock of the Congo State
Railway, 100 at par, is quoted at 5000. Spaniard never found in America
