<p>Sir,<lb/>
I have the honor to bring to 
your notice the loss of the ship "Joseph
Nickerson" of New York, owned by
Messrs Yates &amp; Porterfield of New York, 
on the 20th December 1876, at Sharks
Point, Congo River.</p>

<p>From the statement of the 
Captain, a copy of which is herewith
enclosed, it appears that she took
the ground in entering the River in 
consequence of the strong current that 
was recurring, attempts more made to 
get her off, and the vessel would 
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.003"/>
in all probability have been saved, 
had not the natives come down
in numbers and cut the stern
hawsers by which she was being 
<unclear>warped</unclear> into deep water.</p>

<p>Valuable and friendly assistance
was rendered by the Agent
and other members of the Dutch
House (<unclear>Afrikaansche Handelsvereniging</unclear>)
from <unclear>Banana</unclear>, about 
eight miles distant. There Agent
here in Loanda, has applied to 
me for information as to their compensation
or salvage, neither the 
vessel nor any portion of the Cargo
was saved, and I have referred 
them to the owners in New York.</p>

<p>Her Britannic Majesty's
steam vessel "Avon" has gone to
<catchwords>Sharks</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.004"/>
Sharks Points, at the request of 
the English consul to enquire into 
the matters. Last year a similar
act of piracy occured in the Congo
River, and the natives were very severly
puunished by the English Commodore.</p>

<p>In granting the seamen a passage
to Liverpool, England, I had to 
take into consideration that there were
no American Vessels in this Port,
and that their detention here at this
time, the most dangerous and unhealthy
to unacclimatized persons, has not
advisable.</p>

<p>I beg to bring to your notice
the name of Captain J. W. Davis,
of the African Royal Mail Steamer
"Ethiopia", who kindly gave the Captain
and shipwrecked nun of the "Joseph
<catchwords>Nickerson"</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.005"/>
Nickerson" a free passage from Banana
Congo River, to Loanda, and he
has also promised to put two of
the men on his articles if he can 
find a vacancy for them on the 
passage home.</p>

<p>I have communicated all
the foregoing circumstances to
the United States consul in Liverpool
to whose charge the men have
been sent</p>

<p>I further enclose the Register
delivered to me by the Captain of 
the "Joseph Nickerson" although I am 
unable to find instructions to do so.</p>

<p>Declaration made before me. Robt.
Scott Newton, Vice-Commercial
Agent for the United States of America,
this twenty-seventh day of December,
one thouand eight hundred and
seventy six, by Captain A. C. Yates
of the Schooner "Joseph Nickerson" of
New York, official No.13252-
letters H. L. K. J. and owned by Messrs.
Yates &amp; Porterfied of New York.</p>

<p>I left Ambriz on the 18th
December and shaped a course for 
the Congo River. On the 20th December
I arrived off Sharks Point.
The Cargo consisted of some Yar, 
turpentine, paint oil, and black heart,
and about 18 tons of coffee shipped
in Ambriz. The wind was light
<catchwords>and the</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.007"/>
and the current very strong running
out of the River; so in order to make
the Port of Banana I was obliged
to hug the southern shore, and the forepost
of the ship took the sand about
12 o' clock in the day. I immediately
 had as hedge anchor carried out by
the "Yawl" under the charge of the chief
officer, and was succeeding in warping
the vessel off, when a number of natives
came of from Sharks Point. I should
estimate them at about between 400
and 500, in about 70 canoes. They
swarmed about the ship, and they 
cut the Hawser I had out to my hedge.
I attempted to get another Ridge out,
but the natives prevented me. Three
men came on board and tendered
<catchwords>me</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.008"/>
me assistance, &#8212; they called themselves
"King Peter's Son," &#8212; "Jack Wash" &#8212; "Walker"</p>

<p>After my Hawser was cut
I endeavoured to make sail on the
ship, thinking that as the ship was
so nearly afloat, the sail could drive
her off, but the natives swarmed over
the ship's side, and with their knives
cut the sails to pieces, rendering them
perfectly useless. Up to this moment
I had recieved assistance from these
three men before mentioned, but after
this all seemed to join in the plunder,
cabin doors were torn off, &#8212;all the
provisions and spare rigging were
taken out of the tween decks. I 
cannot say for certain that these
three men took part in the plundering
<catchwords>but</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.009"/>
but afterwards I saw many things belonging
to the ship in the native
huts, particularly, I wish to mention,
a trunk belonging to Mr. Swanson
the mate, in the King's house.</p>

<p>The pirates cut the coffee sacks
open and carried away as much
as they could. Four of my men and 
the chief officer took the yawl and 
went to Banana to the Dutch House
for assistance, which was rendered
on the following day, &#8212;the agent
Mr. Bloëme and Mr. Yungblood
and about 10 other Europeans or White
men all well armed, came over with
about 100 Kroomen, and drove the
natives out of the ship -- in fact 
the natives ran away when they 
<catchwords>saw</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.010"/>
saw the assistance coming. I left
the ship about 6 o'clock in the evening
of the day she took the beach 
and going in a native came on
shore was upset and nearly drowned.
I consider this was intentionally
done, as I heard one man say,
"if I was drowned there would be
an end of the palaver". The Dutch
men after driving the natives out
examined the remainder of the cargo
and found the coffee so saturated
with oil and tar, that had been
spilled by the natives, as to be 
utterly worthless. I must here
state that in the arrival of the 
Dutchmen I went back on board
of the vessel and found her completely
<catchwords>gutted</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.011"/>
gutted, bulkheads gone, &#8212;copper torn
off&#8212; sails and rigging cut&#8212; in fact
a perfect, useless wreck. I left after 
this, and shortly afterwards discovered
the vessel to be on fire. I cannot
say by whom she was set on
fire. I saved the ship's  papers 
and chronometer, but lost all my
own personal effects. I wish also
to state that when I saw my 
trunk (I mean Mr. Swanson's trunk)
in the King's house, I called his
attention to it, and said, "if you
are not playing me false: how comes
it that this trunk is in your house?
He said in a sharp tone of voice.
"I know nothing about it&#8212; some
man must have brought it in
<catchwords>here</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0107.012"/>
here". I make this statement 
just to show how much one can
believe in the sincerity of their
friendliness. The King also showed
me a Paper made between himself
and Sir William Hewitt R. N of 
Great Britain, in which he was
recommended as a trustworthy 
man</p>
