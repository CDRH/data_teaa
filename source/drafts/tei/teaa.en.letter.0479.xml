REPORT  

Consular Bureau
May 15th,1875

The oath must, in my opinion, is taken. The Act of July 2, 1862 (12 Stats 502) prescribes the "<unclear/> Clad" oath to be taken by every person elected or appointed to any office of honor or profit in the civil military or naval service. That oath has been and is now required from Consuls who are not in the class of persons named in the Act of July 11, 1868 (15 Stats 85) whose Legal disabilities have been removal. These oaths are prescribed by the Revised Statutes sections 1756 and 1757.

The oath must be taken before the appointer can enter upon the duties of his office or be entitled to any part of the salary or other envolvements.
