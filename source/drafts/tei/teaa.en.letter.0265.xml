Gaboon, Jan 21.1862.

Hon.W.H.Seward 
Washington D.C.

Sir,

I had the honor 
to unite you the 23 Dec. respecting 
the death of Capt.R.E.Lawlin, an
AAmerican trader on the River Femantly,
about 150 miles South of Gaboon.
Since the date of my last, Rev.J.M.
Preston has been to Camma with 
the Mg. Barque Riveria, + brought 
away the goods in the factory +
as much other property as he could
ship. It is all stered in the Gaboon
under my care. A full report of all 
our proceedings has been made to 
<unclear></unclear> James Bishoop gbo. of NeW
York, + I wait the arrival od their agent to deliver the property to him.
I have taken considerable responsibility 
in removing the property + paying 
+ discharging the employees of the factory.
But we have no doubt now 
that the course pursued has been 
the only one for the intrust of the owners.

<pb facs="2010615_105525"

I have made no saler of property 
except to pay expenses. I have paid no 
doubtful debts. We trust that we shall 
be ablw to satisfy the Agent who may 
be sent.

Encloses please find a copy of thr 
form od the call of allegiance forwarded 
to their Agency, signd, + certified 
to by the Commander of Gaboon. As
I remarked in my former letter; I 
do need know how far I am bound to 
act in regard to duties coming 
under this Agency. I know not the
boundraies of jurisidiction. But I do 
not wish to act at all, except for 
the interests of <unclear></unclear>

Allow me to suggest suggest that I find no 
form of passport. Certificate, Petition 
Protest, or any paper. No form of 
any kind, + no table to be filled of 
shipping or any thing else. many 
such duties arise forms are safe,
in <unclear></unclear> + convenient in practice.

I am, Sir, Your obedient servant 
W.M.Walker.
