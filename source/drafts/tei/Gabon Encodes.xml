<lines>Legation of the United States
Paris October 5th 1882<lines>

<stamp>Direction

6 OCT. 1882<stamp>

<stanza> On or about the 16th of 
February last, the Captain of the 
French gunboat "Marabout"acting 
under orders, destroyed by setting 
them on fire, certain establishments 
of the African natives on the Gabon
River.<stanza>

<stanza>One of the establishments found
was an out station of the American 
Presbyterian mission situated on<stanza>

Paris.

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.362.002.jpg"/>

<stanza> Negenengue or Ningué Island. 
The "Marabout," it is true [unreadable-2 words]
fire to the property of the Mission
But its hostile course around some
of the native tribes, who rushed [unreadable]
Ningué-Ningue, after the departure
of the gunboat, broke into the 
builiding of the Mission and
plundered everything it contained.
The members of the American Mis-
sion, who are represented by the
Rev. Mr. Walker, had no oppor-
-tunity of saving their property.
They were not notified in advance 
by the French Authorities of any
intended hostilities against the 
natives, and, to their knowledge,
the inhabitants of Ningué-Ningué 
had committed no act which<stanza

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.362.003.jpg"/>

<stanza> could have given them reason
to suppose that any such action
was contemplated. It appears 
that some time before the de-
struction of this village, the 
Captain of the gunboat declared 
that there was no intention of 
proceeding against its people.
It cannot, I think be claimed 
that the French Authorities are
not responsible for the destruction 
of the Mission, as the natives 
would certainly never have
resolved to violence and plunder
if war had not been waged 
against them. During the 30 
years the Mission has existed 
in Gabon, it has enjoyed the 
friendship of the natives, who
were often left alone mi charge<stanza>

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.362.004.jpg"/>

<line>of its building and property.<line>

<stanza>In presence of these facts
the American Mission of Gabon
claims an indemnity of three
thousand, five hundred francs
(3500.frs) for the loss sustained
in consequence of the action of the French authorities of the 
Colony, and I am instructed
by my governent to lay this claim 
before you Excellency.<stanza>

<stanza> The amount of property de-
-stroyed is of no consequence to a 
government like France, but it 
is a large amount for poor 
clergymen who have exiled &
themselves in a distant and
uncivilized land for the cause
of religion and morality.<stanza>

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.362.005.jpg"/>

<stanza>At the time of this un-
pleasant incident, the Rev. Mr. Walker, speaking in the name 
of the Mission, applied to Captain
Blerin. Commanding the Colony 
for the indemnity which is here
claimed. But this officer, through
replying that the claim would
be submitted to the proper
authority, seems to have mis-
-understood its real foundation
and true character.<stanza>

<stanza> I cannot believe that the
French Government, after a full
examination of the facts, will
adopt the defence outlined by
Commandant Blérin that the
mission station trespassed upon
French territory, as such contention<stanza>

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.362.005.jpg"/>

<stanza>would not effect the nature of the claim.<stanza>

<stanza> The simple question at 
issue seems to be whether the
Mission station was pillaged
by hostile natives in consequence
of the destruction ordered by the 
French authorities, and if this 
destruction was called for by 
such an emergency of self defense
as would prevent warning to
non combattants<stanza>

<stanza>In the latter case the French
Government will, doubtless, of its 
own accord, lender indeminfication[?]
tot hese worthy men, who, since 
their establishment in Gabon.
more than a quarter of a century
ago-have held the most cordial<stanza>

<pb facs="teaa.fr.letter.362.006.jpg"/>

<stanza> relations with the Colonial au-
thorities and have been a 
powerful adjunct to the civilizing
and moral tendencies of the French
rule on this part of the African
Coast.<stanza>

<stanza> I avail myself of this occasion
to renew the assurance of the dist-
tinguished consideration with 
which I have the honor to be.<stanza>

<signed> Your Excellency's
Most obedient servant;
L.P.Morton<signed>
