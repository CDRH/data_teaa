<p>The Ethonology of Madagascar
By Rev. B. F. Wheeler, A.M., D.D.
Read Before the New York Ministers Meeting</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>Madagascar, as all are aware, lies off the south-east coast of 
the continent of Africa. To be a little more definite or explicit, 
we may say that by exact measurement it lies between 12* and
25* south latitude, and 42* and 51* east longitude.</p>
<p>With the exception of Borneo, Madagascar is the largest 
island in the worl. It is about 970 miles long and between
300 and 400 miles wide. To get a better idea of its size, it con-
tains an area of 200,000 square miles, which would make it as
large as England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the States of
New York, New Hampshire, Massachusettes, Connecticut and
Rhode Island combined.</p>
<p>The land is low along the coast, and this low, marshy land
extends, inwardly for 30 or 40 miles. In the interior there is a
broad table land. A range of mountains rises from this table
land and extends North and South nearly the entire length of
the island. It does not appear, however, as far as we have been
able to find out, that the structure of these Ankasatia mountains
is such as to make it possible for Madagascar even to be proven
to be a continent, as Australia has been shown to be. Some of
the mountain peaks rise 8000 and 12000 feet above the level of
the sea.</p>
<p>There are abundant beautiful lakes and rivers throughout
the island, but unfortunately none of the rivers are navigable.
Undergrowth and shrubbery all over the island make traveling
exceedingly difficult. There are no roads and it is the policy of
the government never to have any constructed. This shrubbery
and undergrowth furnish a good natural defense they claim, and
make it impossible for an invading army ever to reach Tanana-
rivo the capital of the island. Some of the largest forests in the
world abound in this island.</p>
<p>Tropical fruits of all kinds are found in abundance there;
some of these, however, are not indigenous, but have been intro-
duced by travellers or naturalists. The orange, for example, now
grows in abundance, but it has been introduced by travelers.</p>
<p>Like most tropical countries there are only two seasons in
Madagascar, the wet and the dry,- the former lasting from April 
to November and the latter from December to March. Two
crops may be raised during the year, the one gathered in June,
the other in December. As might be expected, rice, sweet-pota-
toes, coffee and sugar cane are the principal products, and of
these great quantities are raised annually. The island is full of
wild cattle. In fact Mauritius and all the neighboring islands
are supplied with beef from Madagascar. But let this suffice for
a brief description of the island is general and let us now con-
sider more particularly the more important subject, namely:-</p>
<p>The People of Madagascar<!--This to the left is in italics-->.- The People of Madagascar
have received special attention at the hands of ethnologists and
naturalists for a great many years. The great question which
puzzled these learned men most was to prove the race identity
of these people. Had they gone at the matter in the right way,
seeking truth and being governed by the light of that truth, I
suspect they would have had a comparatively easy time in set-
tling the question. But because they have gone at it with con-
victions or prejudices of their own, by which they were deter-
mined to stand, they have had a rather hard time in settling the
race identity of the people of this large island.</p>
<p>When the island was first made known to Europe by Marco
Polo in the 13th century, and as late as the latter part of the
17th and beginning of the 18th century, about 200 years ago,
when Robert Drury wrote of the inhabitants as such savage
cannibals that he was afraid that they would leap upon him and
eat him alive, it was pretty generally conceded that they were
Africans. In fact Madagascar was only thought of as an African
island and its inhabitants Africans. But during the present
century, and especially during the last forty years, when the peo-
ple have made such marvellous strides towards civilization, the
Caucasian historian, ever true to his prejudice, has striven to
prove that the inhabitants of Madagascar are of Malayan origin,
at least, that they were not of African descent. And it is aston-
ishing to the calm, unbiased thinker, to notice some of the
strange and far=fetched arguments some of these ethnologists and
historians have employed to substantiate their theories.</p>
<p>We lay down the broad statement that the aborigines of
Madagascar are Africans, or of African descent. We believe
that a careful study of the subject, on the part of any who have
not a bias or penchant toward race prejudice, will enable them to
reach the same conclusion. Unfortunately so far, the only
ethnologists or historians who have written on this subject have
been Caucasians. And every body knows that the Caucasian
race, as a whole, with all their prejudice against the Negro, is
incpable of treating the Negro, or any Negro descendants fairly,
in anything they may say or write about the Negro. To prove
this statement, we have but to look at the histories of these
United States, the war records of the Nation, the flippant and
after reflections, daily and weekly reports of Negro assemblies,
the unceremonious way with which crimes perpetrated upon
Negroes are dismissed by the white press. It will be seen that
when praise ought to be rendered by the Negro, the Caucasian
historian or press is silent, when mercy ought too be shown
him, no voice through the press is heard, When justice ought to
be demanded, no justice is asked for by the press, Thank God
here and there a noble exception to this rule is found. And we
take pleasure in mentioning foremost among the noble excep-
tions,- The New York Independent. <!--this is in italics--></p>
<p>There are in round numbers 5,000,000 souls inhabiting this
island. They are short of stature, have beautiful white teeth,
black eyes and range in complexion from a dark olive color to
jet black. The hair is black in color, but in texture varies from
the purest wool, or the hardest kink, to almost straight with a
slight wave. Many of them have excellent foreheads and intel-
ligent countenances. The oft spoken of retreating forehead as a
distinguishing Negro characteristic will not be found in many
cases here. For long ago has that description of a representa-
tive Negro type been abandoned by all except the most pre-
judiced of historians. Especially has it been abandoned since
Stanley found such a high type of Negroes in certain portins of
the continent of Africa. The people of Madagascar, especially
the females, are said to be some of the most beautiful people on
the face of the earth. They call themselves Malagasy. Just
how the name Madagascar originated is not easy to tell. But as
far back as the 13th century, Marco Polo, in reporting the dis-
covery of the island in Europe said that it was called Magaster.</p>
<p>Like all heathens, in the early part of their history before
they became christianized, they worshipped all kinds of idols,
and were superstitious. They marry at the early age of from 12
to 14. Polygamy and slavery prevailed to within the last few
years, in fact polygamy prevails to some extent even yet. They
are now nearly all not only civilized, but largely christianized,
and have schools and colleges, and engage in commerce with
the nations of the earth with marvellous success. In 1888 their
exports to the United States alone amounted to $806,555, while the 
imports from this country to that island amount to $823,856.
The government is an absolute monarchy and they count back to
37 monarchs who have sat on the throne.</p>
<p>Now, as we have siad, when it was discovered that these
people were making such wonderful strides in the arts and
sciences, and all that goes to make up a very high state of
Christian civilization, historians and ethnologists set about to
prove that they must be descendants of some other race, rather
than the African race.</p>
<p>I. And the first argument advanced was that aborigines
were Malayans. This view was especially advocated by Dr.
Sclater an eminent naturalist and ethnologist, and to prove this
he claims that the island of Madagascar itself was formerly a 
part of the Malayan peninsular- that the Malayan peninsular at
one time extended from where it now is, to Madagascar, and
that Madagascar was a part of the peninsular. To strengthen
this argument they claim that the continent once extended over
this vast area has since been submerged and become the Indian
Ocean. of course if it could be proven that the Malayan penin-
sular once extended from where it is now is to Madagascar, it
would be pretty conclusive that the aboriginess were Malayan-
except that we would not know how to account for the woolly
hair of the majority of them.</p>
<p>But let us examine this theory more carefully.
1. In the first place, there is no evidence anywhere that
there was ever a continent where the Indian Ocean now is.
2. In the second place instead of a slight depression 
between the Malayan peninsular and Madagascar, as would nat-
turally be in case of a submerged continent, the Indian Ocean is
known to be one of the very deepest of the five great oceans. In
fact, in some parts of this ocean it is so deep that soundings can-
not be made at all. This theory then of a submerged continent
or continental extension is purely speculation, to use the mildest
term in describing it.</p>
<p>II. Another argument advanced to show that they were of
Malay descent was that the trade winds and currents would be 
favorable to the Malays. This is the view of Mr. G. A. Shaw,
once a missionary to Madagascar. It is claimed that a few
Malays who are a great maritime race, were cruising in their
canoes, when they finally lost their course and were driven by
the trade winds toward Madagascar. That they finally reached
the island taking their families with them, settled on the south-
eastern shores and lived there for several generations until they
got sufficiently strong, when they made war on the neighboring
tribes, the Vazamba conquered them and fought their way to
the high lands of the interior where the capital Tananarivo
now is, and established themselves as the rulers of the island.
This is the account of the Hovas, now settled in the Aukova
district.</p>
<p>1. But against this theory it may be said it is difficult to
conceive of persons at that remote date, long before Columbus
came to America, with small craft, scarcely larger than our
canoes, venturing on such a voyage, and even if they were driven
out of their course and blown by the winds to Madagascar it
would be almost absurd to think of them living long enough
with their families, to be drifted between two and three thousand
miles, especially when it is remembered that waterspouts, sea
squalls and the like are of such frequent occurrence at all times
in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>2. But even if this could be proven it would only account 
for the Hova, or one of the twenty tribes of the island which Mr.
Shaw claims to be different from the rest.</p>
<p>3. The Vazimba, (Mzamba,) were there when the Hovas
came, even according to this account, and after all the only persons
autochthonores in the island were these Vazimba, which may
be a general term to designate all in the island besides the
Hovas. There is no effort made to prove that these Vazimba
were Malays, but it is difficult to see how it can be proven that
the aborigines were Malays, when it is admitted that when the
first Malays came they found these Vazimba already autochtho-
nores to the soil.</p>
<p>We doubt very much whether any Malays ever reached the
island in its early history, especially in the way they are said to
have come. But, granted that a few did come in that way, they
could never become any more than one of the twenty other tribes. <!--the word one is italicized--></p>
<p>III. Another argument used to show that the aborigines
are not of African descent, is the fact that some of the words in
their language are Polynesian.</p>
<p>1. But while it will be admitted as the most natural thing
that some of the words of the Malagasy are Polynesian, the
Island lying within the great sweep of the Polynesian language,
some of the words would naturally be incorporated into to
Malagasy language, but we shall show presently that the Poly-
nesian language finds but little place in the Malagasy language.</p>
<p>IV. Effort was made by Mr. Straniland Wake, in 1880,
to prove that the Malagasy were of Siamese descent.</p>
<p>1. But we will not stop to consider that theory, since there
is scarcely anything in common between the Siamese and the
Malagasy.</p>
<p>Now, instead of going so far out of the wya to prove that
the Malagasy are not of African descent, how much easier to
accept the plain and natural view, that the aborigines of the
Island are of African descent. Reason and common sense are
certainly in favor of this view.</p>
<p>I. In the first place, the close proximity of Madagascar to 
Africa is a strong argument we think in favor of this view.</p>
<p>From Madagascar it is only two or three hundred miles to
Africa, across the Mozambique channel.</p>
<p>II. The position of the Island, long and narrow lying par-
allel with Africa, shows that it is a continental Island.</p>
<p>III. Besides, this channel is very shallow and dotted with
many islands. This would show that Madagascar is but an off-
shoot of this continent, and that, therefore, the inhabitants of the 
Island are Africans.</p>
<p>IV. But even if the Africans were not autochthonous of
the soil of Madagascar, it would still be a very easy thing for
them to make their way from Africa from one of the small 
islands to another, until they had finally reached Madagascar.</p>
<p>V. This is all the more possible when it is admitted by
Mr. Geo. A. Shaw, who labors so hard to prove that the Mala-
gasy are of Malay extraction, that although the trade winds are
generally from East to West, yet that there are times when the
wind is from West to East- from Africa to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is far more reasonable to think of the aborigines in this
way making their way from Africa to Madagascar- only about
250 miles- than to think of them drifting three thousand miles
across a wild and tempestuous ocean.</p>
<p>But Mr. Shaw argues that it is almost impossible for the
early inhabitants of Madagascar to have come from Africa, be-
cause the abruptness of the coast of Africa nearest Madagascar
would prevent the Africans in those parts from ever becoming a
maritime race.</p>
<p>1. To this argument it is but necessary to say, that all 
students of classical history know that the Greeks around the
high mountains of Achaia, Orgollio, and other portions of the
Peloponnesus, coming down from their mountain fastnesses,
engaged in sea faring life and made themselves, by daring and
adventurous exploits, terrors to all mariners passing by those
parts. And why should it be thought incredible that the Afri-
cans on the east coast of Africa could do likewise.</p>
<p>2. But even if they did not venture to go there of their
own accord, since, as Mr. Shaw claims, it was customary for the
Malays in those days to carry their families with them on their
voyages, so the Africans might have had their women in their
boats with them and been drifted<!--drifted is italicized--> across the channel to Mada-
gascar.</p>
<p>VI. But there are other arguments in favor of the aborig-
ines of this Island being Africans.</p>
<p>Dr. Hildebrandt, the great German traveller, ethnologist, nat-
uralist, and expert in craneology, often having made many cran-
ium and facial measurements, with the best scientific instruments,
and noticing carefully the physiognomy of the people in south-
ern and central Africa, and comparing them with many which
he made in Madagascar, gave as his opinion, that the inhabitants
of the entire island of Madagascar were of African descent.
And Mr. Shaw, who holds radically different views from Dr.
Hildebrandt, admits that "In a conversation which I had with
him (Dr. Hildebrandt) in the early part of 1881, he said that as
far as his research in the matter went, he was led to the conclu-
sion that while there was some slight indications of a connection
in race between the Hovas, and the South<!--South is italicized--> Africans, the similarity
between the coast tribes of the island and those of Central<!--Central is italicized--> Africa
was most marked." This is a strong argument, for Dr. Hilde-
brandt is probably the best authority of all the ethnologists who
have visited the island. This is important, too, because he does
not even grant that the Hovas are any other than Africans.</p>
<p>VII. Mr. Dahle, also an ethnologist of some distinction,
gives his opinion of the early inhabitants of Madagascar as fol-
lows: "The Vazimba may ahve been a collective name for sev-
eral East African tribes, growing gradually into disuse as these
tribes became more separated, and from this common stock the
original inhabitants of Madagascar, the Vizamba, were an off-
shoot."</p>
<p>VIII. Then the language of the Malagasy resembles very
much the language of the Hottentots and other tribes inhabiting
the central and south-eastern coasts of Africa.</p>
<p>Take a few words for example, and notice how much more 
closely the Malagasy and African resemble each other, then the
Malagasy and the Malaysia. These words we take from Prof.
Keolle's splendid "Polyglotta Africana:"</p>
<p>English      African             Malagasy        Malaysia
Eye             {Mazo               Maso            Mata
                {Maso
Cow             Nombe (13 dialects) {Ombe         {Sapi
                                    {Omby         {Lembu
Fowl            Koku                Akoku          Kuching
Dog             Mboa (12 dialects)  Amboa          Anjiing</p>
<p>So that we see that even in language these people are
Africans. And what is true of one portion of the island relative
to their language is practically true of the entire island. Mr.
Wallace admits that when he says that "the language through-
out Madagascar is essentially one, divided certainly into a num-
ber of dialects, but differing no more from one another than that
of Lacashire from the English of London." Thus it appears
from the language that the Hovas even are African, for they
have no other language than the frizzle haired Sakalavas or
Betsileos.</p>
<p>IX. Again the Flora in Madagascar is almost identical
with that of Africa. The Man-eating and one or two other
plants which are peculiar to Madagascar, are about the only ex-
ceptions.</p>
<p>X. Then what is true of the flora is also true of the fauna.
There are a great many animals in Madagascar, but compara-
tively few different species. But what few species there are, are
all, with one or two exceptions, such as are found across the Mo-
zambique channel in Africa.</p>
<p>But Rev. Mr. Geo A. Shaw makes one more argument to
prove that the aborigines of Madagascar were Malayans. He
resorts to certain traditions among the Hovas, to the effect that
"they (the Hovas) came to the island and found a few black
faced people called Vazimba, short of stature, which they (the
Hovas) subdued and finally exterminated, and took possession of
the island."</p>
<p>1. There might be something in such an argument, but for
the fact that nineteen of the twenty tribes now inhabiting the
island have black faces. The blacks, instead of being extermi-
nated are the predominant class throughout the island, number-
ing almost nine to one of the brighter olive colored ones.</p>
<p>XI. Then the tribal life which prevails in East Africa is
almost identical with that of Madagascar.</p>
<p>XII. To a Negro of America it is not strange to hear of
these Hovas trying to disconnect themselves form the rest of
their Malagasy brethren, when we remember who have been
their teachers. Caucasians alone have been their teachers, and
Mr. Douglass announced a very truth when he said, "that the
first thing white missionaries teach heathen of any race, espec-
ially African, is that the white man is superior to all others." If
the white missions taught this lesson to the Malagasy, it is but
natural that those of the lightest complexion should try to make
themselves the descendants of any race rather than the African.
And in doing so, they do nothing more than many Negroes in
America do when they try to pass for Spaniards, Creoles and the
like.</p>
<p>And if we were driven to it, we would account for the light
complexion of the Hovas very much as we account for the light
complexion of certain of the Negroes of America. Especially
when we remember that the Hovas for centuries claim to have
resided on the east of the island, near Tamatave, the principal
sea port town, where Frenchmen, Portuguese, and Englishmen
have been landing for the past six centuries.</p>
<p>Again it is natural for Mr. G. A. Shaw to try to prove that
the Malagasy are other than of African descent, since he ha
married one of the beauties of Madagascar himself. And it
would be an unpardonable breach of race loyalty for him, a white
man, to have married an African girl.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that although in this country and almost
every other country white men look with disdain on wooly heads
and black faces, as being characteristics of the despised Negro
alone, yet in these far off civilizations, where Negroes have ac-
complished such wonders, these same white men even lay claim
to wooly hiar and black faces, in order to deprive these Negroes
of the honor due them.</p>
<p>We conclude with the remark that these noble, intelligent,
enterprising, sable sons and daughters of Madagascar are Afri-
cans- a part of the great race with which we Afro-Americans are
identified. And we hail with joy the phenomenal success they
have made in all that goes to make up a high state of Christian
civilization. Their success is only so much success of the entire
African race.
