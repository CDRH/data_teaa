<p>Edward J. Roye President of Liberia
            To
   His Excellency U.S. Grant
   President of the United States
                    Executive Mansion
                     Monrovia
                       31st March 1871</p>

<p>Great and Good Friend
                      You will please pardon
   my intrusion upon your time and patience
   I hope however you will consider the native
   and importance of the subject which I wish
   to present for your consideration a suf
   ficient apology.
                                        My</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.002"/>

<p>My principal reason in writing you at this
   time is to present to you, as briefly as the
   as the  native and importance of the subject
   will admit the present condition of the Republic
   of Liberia, and what she needs and must have
   at the crisis, to enable her government to become es
   tablished upon a permanent basis, and to allow
   her to fully develop her almost inexhaustible
   resources.</p>

<p>     We have a country containing between
   six and seven hundred miles along the sea coast
   and extending far back into the interior. The
   civilized portion of the population is small only
   copmrising about twenty or twenty five thou
   sand. Of native Africans we have about 
   five hundred thousand within the limits
   of the Republic many of whom have made
   more or less progress towards civilization</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.003"/>

<p>The history of this Colony must be familiar
   to every <unclear/> Americans. To rise pro
   gress and present state are well known
   to the statesmen of all countries.</p>

<p>     For nearly fifty years, we have
   been struggling to establish a free government
   and to build up Republican institutions, in
   the land of our forefathers. <unclear/> far we
   have been successful, we must leave the
   civilized <unclear/> to fudge, We have done
   all that we could witht he limited <unclear/>
   at our command to accomplish the great
   object of our mission here.</p>

<p>     The first emmigrants
   arrived on these shores comparatively poor</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.004"/>

<p>and ignorant having been born and
   reared amid the institutions of slavery
   where they had but for opportunities
   for mental improvement and for 
   the accumulation of wealth</p>

<p>     These colonies were
   orignally established under the auspices
   of the American Colonization Society.
   Since then they have been united under
   one government called "The Republic
   of Liberia"</p>

<p>     But our government
   is like all other new governments
   poor and is therefore enable millions aid</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.005"/>

<p>from other sources to progress as rapidly
   as the interests of the people and the pro
   gress of the age require.</p>

<p>     This government even with
   its hands tied by the want of adequate
   means and heavilyg oppressed by poverty
   has still done much to <unclear/>
   favorably to the consideration of the civil-
   ized world. It has done that which for 
   many years baffled the united efforts of
   America and England; sir: it has 
   demolished the slave factories on the land
   and broken up the lsave trade on the
   sea-coast, within the jurisdiction of
   this government.</p>

<p>     It may be deemed <unclear/>
   on me to add that Liberia <unclear/>
                              <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.006"/>

<p>and almost unlimited resources. if
   her government and people only had
   the means necessary to fully develop
   them. Her valleys and hills, forests and
   fields abound with the choicest products
   of the earth. Our forests are filled with
   the most valuable timber, drywoods, and
   gururs. We pessess a soil of unsurpassed
   fertility suitable for the growth of everything
   that will thrive written the tropics.</p>

<p>All we need is the necessary means to
   open roads, build bridges tc, that are
   may be enabled to cultivate and improve
   ourlands and bring our products to
   market. Is establish, a system of
   internal improvement; and facilitate our
   progress in agricultures, we need laborers
                                     saving</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.007"/>

<p>saving machines. For the moral and 
   mental improvement of the Americao Liberians
   and also the native tribes arounders, are
   need money. <unclear/> the resources
   of Liberia cannotr be developed. our vast
   ellimitable fields cannot be cultivated.
   and without this material aid schools and
   churches cannot be established among
   the native population. Unless we can get
   money the wheels of government must be
   stopped or move on with very slow progress.</p>

<p> In order then that we may rise rapidly
   from our infant state towards national 
   manhood, and to enable us to keep pace
   with the progress of the age, to reveal the
   great experiment of founding a govern-
   ment of colored men on the soil of Africa,
                                       from</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.008"/>

<p>from proving to be a disgraceful failure
   we are compelled to solicit precuniary
   aid from the friends of human progress
   and few institutions wherever they may 
   be found.</p>

<p>     While it is true that Africa
   is our fatherland; get we regard America
   as our mother country and are sincere
   by believe that her government and people
   feel an interest in our welfare, and the
   success of our undertaking.</p>

<p>     For this reason we make our appeal
   to the government and people of the
   United States or through such other persons
   as you may deem proper, to negotiate a
   loan of five hundred thousand dollars
                                     in <unclear/></p>

   you may wish to see <unclear/> that is

   pleased to furnish you at any time.</p>

<p>     Should we be enabled to effects <unclear/>
   <unclear/> we desire that the cost of the mu
   nitions of war with the interest thereon
   and the amount dce for the "Rescue" in
   cluding the cost of sending her out, shall
   be dedacted from the amount loaned.

<p>Our ChargÃ¨ d'Affaires is fully authorised
   to negotiate with the United States govrn-
   ment</p>

<p>    From the very pelasant and apreci
   able interview that I had with you
   during my recent visit to the United 
   States. I am strongly induced to believe
   that you will ful so great an interest
   in the rapid progress of the only Republ
   ican government of colored men on the
   West Coast of Africa. That you will do
   everything in you rpower to secure this
   loand for the benefit of Liberia and
   thus cause it to be recorded upon the
   page of impartial history, another
   substantial proof of the fact:
          That the great Republic of the</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0194.011"/>

<p>United States is a true friend of the
   Negro Race</p>

<p>     It is my duty to inform your
   Excellency that James E. Moore Esqr has
   so acted against the government that he
   is objectionally holding the Office of
   U.S. Vice-Consul minister Resident near this gov
   ernment.</p>

<p>     With feelings of the most profound
   respect.
           I remain
                  Yours truly, E.J. Roye

P.S.-<unclear/> will do as
   well as any other kind of <unclear/></p>
