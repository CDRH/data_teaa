Mr Alexander Clark
to the Department of State

<p>Subject</p>

<p>Ola and Neseless official
documents in the Legation,
especially those of date priro
to the year 1885: &amp;c</p>

<p>Synopsis</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1073.jpg"/>

<p>No 11 Dispatch Consulate General Series
United States Legation Monrovia
Liberia Febuary 12th, 1891:</p>

<p>To the Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State 
Washington D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your
circular (SD 12-12-90-1100)
from the Department of State
under the date of December 12th 1890:
In reply to said circular I
respectfully submit the following:
1st There are a goodly number of
old unbound or untied dispatches
in the Legation of date prior
to the year 1885 which seemingly
can never be of use to the
department or this office:
2nd There are ten (10) packages of
dispatches and printed circulars
dating back and down to this
date which are neatly bound
or tied with paper covering</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1074.jpg"/>

<p>covering by the Honorable John H.
Smyth, Samuel S. Sevier, and
M. A. Anemiey; and a large number
of unbound dispatches of the
Honorable J Milton Turner and
others which are in a condition
that makes them unfit for
binding. The Hon E. E. Smith left
quite a number that are unbound
but can be tied or bound easily
and they are worth preserving:
3 There are 15 record books from
Grand Bassa and Cap Palmas and two
(2) worn out seals and flag which
are mentioned in my dispatch
consular series No. 2., of November
20th 1890 as Inclosure No. 2. inventory:
4 There are quite a number of
old letters and domestic Dispatches
that may be of use.
5. There are 100 blank drafts in the
safe that are not negotiable here
without considerable expence
and trouble see inclosure marked
No 1 for sample of said drafts</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1075.jpg"/>

<p>all the afore mentioned can
be kept without any additional
expence as the messenger
boy has time to care
for them in common with
the Libary books which must
be seen after once or twice
a fortnight and there are
sufficient room in the
Legation rooms without
any inconveniences &amp;c
Yet if it is thought advisable
by the department that those
dispatches that are untied, dirty
and mildewed Should not be kept
please so insturct, with reference
to drafts please send by mail
blank form of my first draft
draft No one (1) dated November
20 1890 for salary transmit &amp;c</p>

<p>Sir; I have the honor
to be your obediant
Servant Alexander Clark;
S Minister Resident &amp; Consul Gen</p>
