<p>Office of the Penna. Colonization Soc.<lb/>
Phila. March 19, 1862</p>

<p>To Abraham Lincoln<lb/>
President of the United States</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>We read that Alexander
cut the Gordian Knot with his sword. Now I
have a suggestion to make by which I fondly hope
that the knot in regard to the acknowledgment of the
independence of Liberia may be peacefully and quickly
untied by a few strokes of your pen.</p>

<p>Hear me then, a few moments, in the midst
of your pressing duties.</p>

<p>In London there resides Gerard Ralston, 
a Philadelphia by birth, but for thirty years a resident
of Great Britain. He has negotiated, without
charge, the treaties with most of the European
governments. Before me is a letter, dated
Feb. 26, 1862 in which he writes:</p>

<p>"I am to have a conference with Mr
Adams about Liberian affairs and hope his
influence with the American Government will aid
in procuring a speedy recognition. I should like to

<pb n="Roll2-0035.jpg"/>

make a treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation
with Mr Adams for the joint benefit of Liberia and
the United States. I can probably manage this better
than can be done at Washington as I have already
made so many treaties and know the views
and desires of the Liberian Government so well.
My Colonization friends in America might
probably promote this object at Washington. Mr
Adams and I, could save Mr Seward
all trouble in this matter. He has trouble enough
already at Washington and he does not wish
an increase of work in his department of State."</p>

<p>There seems to be great wisdom in this
kind suggestion. Can it not be carried out.
It avoids the chimera of colored ambassadors.
Instead of seeming to go out of the way to acknowledge
a colored Republic a treaty is sent, in
this way, to the Senate, for their ratification.</p>

<p>Will you consult Mr Seward about
this plan? Cannot the weights be lifted, thus,
from the shoulders of the young and thriving African
Republic? One of the best friends of America is the brave
Flag Officer Foote.</p>

<pb n="Roll2-0036.jpg"/>

<p>You are daily remembered in earnest prayer. God
has guided, and will guide you, I trust, in
all the perils which we are encountering.</p>

<p>With much respect<lb/>
Yours truly<lb/>
Thomas S. Malcom<lb/>
Co. Sec. of the
Penna. Colonization Society</p>
