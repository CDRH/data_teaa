<p>To the Honorable the Senate and the House of Representatives;–</p>

<p>In assembling again for the transaction of the business of
the year, it is our first duty to acknowledge, with unfeigned
gratitude, the Beneficent Providence Who has sustained us
amidst difficult surroundings.</p>

<p>It is cause for felicitation, that notwithstanding the almost
unprecedented depression that has embarrassed trade and 
commerce, and industry generally, throughout the civilized world,
the country has been free from the suffering and the insurrectionary
outbursts that have afflicted other lands. This is owing,
in great measure, to the bounteousness of soil and climate,
the abundance of spontaneous productions, and the law-abiding
disposition of the people.</p>

<p>Our relations with Foreign Powers continue on a friendly
footing.</p>

<p>The diplomatic and consular service of the Republic has 
reached a state of efficiency unprecedented in our history.
Men of the highest position and ability, from sympathy with
the race and nationality which we are endeavoring to build
up, are offering, free of any pecuniary profit, to serve the country;
and the flag of the Republic floats at the legations and
consulates throughout the world. This, surely, points to an
important lesson to be learned by us at home, who, too often,
instead of having our eyes opened to the true interests of the 
country, are blinded by the spoils of office.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between the
Republic and the Kingdom of Belgium, ratified at your last
session, has also been ratified by His Majesty the King of
Belgium, and the ratifications were exchanged at Brussels, on the
first day of April.</p>

<p>The North West Boundary Treaty between the Republic
and the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, ratified at
your last session, has also been ratified by Her Majesty the
Queen; but the exchange of ratifications has been delayed in

<pb n="Roll5-1068.jpg"/>

consequence of the temporary absence of Her Majesty's
representative at Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>The Convention which was signed by the representatives
of the various governments at the Universal Postal Congress
at Lisbon, on the 25th of March, 1885, and which was ratified
at your last session, has also been ratified by the respective
governments, and the ratifications have been exchanged at Lisbon.</p>

<p>The Third International Copyright Conference, for the 
purpose of securing to authors, composers and artists copyright
privileges in this country for reciprocal rights abroad,
assembled at Berne from the 6th to the 9th of September of the
present year. The Republic was represented by its consul
general at Vienna, Mr. William Koentzer, imperial counselor
and member of the chamber of commerce. The Convention,
which has been signed by the representative of the Republic
with a reservation on one subject, will be submitted for
ratification. As, by article 20th, the countries acceding to the
Convention have each the right of withdrawing from the same
after a year's notification, I see no difficulty in the way of
ratification.</p>

<p>Authorized by the Legislative Chambers of Belgium, His
Majesty, King Leopold, has assumed the title of Sovereign of
the Independent State of Congo. His Majesty expresses
the firm confidence, that the new state, in devoting itself to
a mission of peace and civilization, will answer the expectations
of all the Powers. The union between Belgium and the new
state is exclusively personal. This step has been anticipated
by the judgment of the entire world, considering the long,
ardent and unselfish devotion of His Majesty to the
regeneration of Africa.</p>

<p>I have extended recognition, and accredited a representative
near the Government of the Independent State of the Congo.</p>

<p>The Republic has been solicited to take part in the International
Exhibition to be held in Australia, next year. 
Although our able consul-general, Robert Litton, Esqr., offered
to defray a material part of the expenses, owing to the distance
and the indirect way of transporting products, as well as the 
lateness of the reception of the notice, the invitation was
declined.</p>

<p>The interest of the Government of the United States in the
prosperity and perpetuity of the Republic continues unabated.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you his
Report for the fiscal year. Contrary to what was hoped a year
ago, some of the products of the country have fallen in price
lower than has ever before been experienced; and the depression
which has prevailed in other countries, has been felt in Liberia.
In consequence, the revenue, instead of increasing, has

<pb n="Roll5-1069.jpg"/>

fallen short. The evil has been intensified by the high price
at which foreign commodities have been held in the market
after being imported at very low prices, while home products have
fallen to the lowest level–an abnormal state of things, altogether
at variance with the laws of trade, and can only be
accounted for by the fact of our unwarrantable dependence on
foreign commodities. Increased competition, the increasing and the
varying of home products, will to some extent remedy the evil
complained of; but this state of things cannot be permanently
altered until we shall have begun the practice of economy,
political and domestic, and shall have acquired the moral courage
to face the facts of life in their true character.</p>

<p>The inability of the natives generally to understand this
depression of trade–a state of things beyond the control of
legislative enactment or executive action–has caused some
restlessness in some sections, but not to the extent that might
have been expected.</p>

<p>In consequence of the general depression, considerable business
has been withdrawn from the new ports of entry, to await
a more favorable turn of affairs.</p>

<p>Although there appears a prospect of revival of trade, still
some time will be required for the country to recover from 
the effects of the depression. It becomes necessary, then, that
all financial measures should be regulated with a view to this fact.</p>

<p>I would again recommend that the export duty on marketable
coffee be repealed. Considering the tendency of the native to
engage in predatory wars, to the detriment of life, trade and
commerce, the loss on agricultural produce might be more than
compensated by an additional duty on articles contraband of war,
and on articles that may easily be produced in the country, as
soap, sugar and salt.</p>

<p>To repeat my observation of last year, your wisdom will
point out how far the principle of removing the taxes from agricultural
produce will apply.</p>

<p>The revival of trade will doubtless increase importations into
the country; and this will require a more careful guarding of the 
revenue. In older and more powerful governments, with more
efficient revenue systems than we possess, the loss to the
revenue from undervaluation of invoices has been in astonishing
proportions; and it must be expected that the revenue of the
country will suffer from the same cause, to an equal, if not
greater extent, unless some measure be adopted to prevent the
evil.</p>

<p>The "Act to repeal certain portions of the Act authorizing
specific duties on certain articles imported into the Republic of
Liberia, and the collection of the same, and regulating the payment
of duties on imports," approved <sic>Febuary</sic> 8th, 1878, re-</p>

<gap extent="two pages" reason="missing from source"/>

<pb n="Roll5-1070.jpg"/>

<p>I would recommend, that on first application only a certificate
should be granted, and that the applicant should not be
secured in the possession of said land by a deed, until certain
improvements had been made; that the law should fix the
limit of time within which such improvements should be made;
and that the law should declare within what time after a 
cessation or apparent cessation of operations, the land may be
considered as having reverted or escheated to the Government.
If the law should state what proportion of the land should
be improved to secure a deed, then it is probable applications
would be made only for necessary and reasonable quantities.</p>

<p>The law organizing the County government of Montserrado,
passed at your last session, has been put in force. The law
having been enacted near the close of the session, and probably
somewhat hurriedly, is not sufficiently full and explanatory.
It is true, it forms the County government on the model
of the other counties. But the case of Montserrado is an
anomaly–quite different from that of the other counties.
In the other counties there is a single superintendent; in
Montserrado there are four.</p>

<p>From the fact that the Appropriation bill, passed after the
county bill, provided for the support of the other superintendencies,
it was rightly inferred that they were to be continued.
But it can readily be seen how, in such circumstances, a conflict
might arise. Even had there been left to the framers of
the bill more time for deliberation, it would have been impossible
to foresee all the contingencies that might arise. All
laws that are worth much come by growth. In the case of
the leeward counties, the superintendents were not really the
creation of a law ordained before their appointment; but
the law was the result of a practice that had grown into a
law–a practice of appointing "general superintendents,"
as they were originally called–who were the vice-gerents
of the Executive in the leeward counties.</p>

<p>Probably sufficient time has elapsed to enable the Legislature
to see what amendatory or explanatory provisions are necessary.
Whatever measures may be adopted, I have to recommend that
the Superintendency of Robertsport remain under the immediate
direction of the Chief Executive. The reasons for this are
strong. This department is at one extreme of the Republic;
there are near the boundary warlike tribes that require discreet
management; and the territories of a foreign government adjoining
the boundary, there will sometimes arise delicate international 
questions that cannot be handled by the county government,
but must be referred for solution to the Chief Executive
Government.</p>

<p>I have been informed that the road to the Camwood section,
in the county of Grand Bassa, which had been closed, to which
I called your attention last session, has been opened for trade</p>

<p>Whenever difficulties of the kind occur, the complicated and

<pb n="Roll5-1071.jpg"/>

conflicting trade interests sometimes so obscure the real cause
of difficulty, as to prevent the Government from ascertaining
clearly its duty in the matter. Sometimes, too, movements
that appear to be serious and warlike, are merely an extensive
haggling for prices. And these contentions about prices ought
to be distinguished from cases where the majesty of the law is
set at defiance. Otherwise, the Government will sometimes find
itself ranged on the side of one class of traders and opposed to
another class.</p>

<p>The war waging last year between the Golahs and Ding
Golahs on the one side and the Boatswain tribes on the other, 
to which I referred at your last session, has been brought to
a close. The aggression came from Boporu, or the Boatswain
section; and was led by certain chieftains who, under the previous
administration, had received large subsidies to keep the
road open for trade. These chieftains had willfully misinterpreted
their engagements by plundering industrious and peaceable
tribes.</p>

<p>The permission granted to the Golahs to fight, was limited
to the defense of themselves and the expulsion of the intruders
beyond their possessions. But the result of war cannot
always be foreseen; and very often a single step takes one
beyond the line dividing defensive and offensive operations. The
result of the war was, that the Golahs were compelled to capture
and hold Boporu.</p>

<p>Had the <sic>financies</sic> of the State justified, the best means of
permanently quieting that section of country that had been
long in the possession of tribes who were always inciting to war
for predatory gain, would have been to place a small garrison
there. But the best that could be done under existing circumstances,
was to allow the Golahs to retain Boporu for the present.</p>

<p>I have again to call your attention to a subject which
becomes more and more urgent. In my previous messages, I
referred to the practice of constables and tax collectors reporting
in the Quarterly Court, a practice which increases the expenses
of the Judiciary, and seriously retards the business of the
Court. The evil is growing to an alarming extent. Independently
of this, as I have before stated, it is not possible to
ascertain the correctness of reports under the <sic>persent</sic> system.</p>

<p>The Bill passed at your last session, entitled "An Act to
alter and amend the several acts establishing the Judiciary
and regulating the powers common to the several Courts of
Quarter Sessions and Common Please of the Counties," was
intended to remedy one of the evils complained of–the
retarding of the business of the Court; and while this was
good so far as it was intended to go, the bill appeared to be
nullified by the fourth and fifth sections–the principles involved
in which were considered questionable. The Legislature
adjourning a short time after the presentation of the bill,

<pb n="Roll5-1072.jpg"/>

the Executive was not allowed the constitutional time for its
consideration.</p>

<p>The third section of the above recited Act provides for vouchers
for the reports. This provision, with an additional one
that would save the enormous expense of mileage, would meet
the case. And I am of opinion that this expense of mileage,
which is out of all proportion to the good accomplished, can
be saved, and ought to be saved, by taking these reports out
of the regular quarterly business of the Court; and thus allow
to be applied to its legitimate purpose the large amount of
money that is intended to meet the ends of justice.</p>

<p>The law organizing the County government of Montserrado,
passed at your last session, has been put in force. The law
having been enacted near the close of the session, and probably
somewhat hurriedly, is not sufficiently full and explanatory.
It is true, it forms the County government on the model
of the other counties. But the case of Montserrado is an
anomaly–quite different from that of the other counties. In
the other counties, there is a single superintendent; in
Montserrado, there are four.</p>

<p>From the fact that the Appropriation bill, passed after the
County bill, provided the support of the other superintendencies,
it was rightly inferred that they were to be continued.
But it can readily be seen how, in such circumstances, a conflict
might arise. Even had there been left to the framers
of the bill time for deliberation, it would have been impossible
to foresee all the contingencies that might arise. All laws
that are worth much, come by growth. In the case of the leeward
counties, the superintendents were not the creation of
a law ordained before their appointment; but the law was
the result of a practice that had grown into a law–the
practice of appointing "general superintendents," as they were
originally called–who were the vice-gerents of the
Executive in the leeward counties.</p>

<p>Probably sufficient time has elapsed to enable the Legislature
to see what amendatory or explanatory provisions are
necessary. Whatever measures may be adopted, I have to
recommend that the superintendency of Robertsport remain under
the immediate direction of the Chief Executive. The reasons
for this are strong. This department is at one extreme of
the Republic; there are near the boundary warlike tribes that
require discreet management; and the territories of a foreign
European government adjoining the boundary, there will
sometimes arise delicate international questions that cannot be
handled by the county government, but must be referred for
solution to the Chief Executive government.</p>

<p>During the months of March and April, accompanied by
my suite, I visited the leeward counties to, inquire into the
condition of the counties and to adjust some difficulties
existing there. My reception was a perfect ovation. Every county,

<pb n="Roll5-1073.jpg"/>

each town, vied with the other in doing honor to the
Nation in the reception accorded the Chief Magistrate. All
organizations, ages, sexes and conditions joined in the rejoicing.
And when it is remembered that these exuberant feelings of joy
were manifested at a time when a gloom was cast over most
parts of the world from the general depression in trade and
commerce, while in rich and powerful nations, there were
riots and insurrections, we ought to feel encouraged by this
hopeful spirit displayed by the people generally.</p>

<p>In the County of Maryland, on the extreme southeast, some
difficulties were adjusted, but there is still in one section of
that County a state of things, to deal with which, I have
to request your advice and co-operation. Probably the
depression of trade and the machinations of a few foreign
adventurers have, in great measure, created a situation
altogether unwarrantable. I say unwarrantable, because I have
received from the principal chiefs in that county, who are as much
affected by the depression of trade–assurances of loyalty and
sympathy. Besides, the Government has the sympathy and
support of the civilized native population.</p>

<p>There is the greatest need of increasing the civilized
population of the lower counties <sic>begining</sic> with the extreme south
eastern county–either by accessions from the tribes or by
immigration from abroad. For the last three years, I have
been endeavoring to procure the assistance of the American
Colonization Society in strengthening that County so exposed
in its situation. And I am assured of a movement at present
in that direction.</p>

<p>The English seven per cent. Loan of 1871 expired on
the 15th of August of the present year. After taking into
account the small amount received by government out of
a loan that was so fraudulently managed, and making due
allowance for the large sum out of which the Republic was
defrauded,–the State still remains responsible. With regard
to this debt, I have to repeat some observations made on a 
previous occasion. "Neither the <sic>Eexecutive</sic> nor the Legislature
can work a miracle; but I have reason to believe that
I shall have your hearty co-operation in any feasible measures
that may be adopted for the extinction of this debt. And
this I expect, not only from consideration of the moral
obligation that binds us, but also in order to restore the credit
of the Republic."</p>

<p>The loan having expired four mouths ago, the matter cannot
be postponed beyond the present session.</p>

<p>What the country is reasonably expected to do, is what
comes within the sphere of its ability. But this ability is not
to be measured by an extravagant appropriation of money in
unnecessary and wrong directions: it is to be ascertained
by a prudent and economical management of the finances.
In other words, not until we shall have cut off all unnecessary

<pb n="Roll5-1074.jpg"/>

expenses, and brought even the necessary expenditures
within the limit of our income, shall we be able to do what
is expected of us.</p>

<p>Considering the falling off in the revenue, consequent on
the depression of trade, retrenchment would be necessary
even had we not this enormous foreign debt to meet. How
much more is it necessary when we have to face both this
debt and a lessened revenue.</p>

<p>The depreciation of government paper arises from
anticipating the revenue, living above, or faster than, the
income. Large salaries are of no advantage when paid in
depreciated money. Eighty cents at their par value are worth
more than one hundred cents discounted on half. Smaller
salaries paid in good money are preferable to larger salaries
paid in bad money, or no money at all. In a healthy and
flourishing condition of the revenue, keeping in view the dignity
and importance of the government, salaries and expenditures
that are now considered large would be regarded as only reasonable.
But salaries and expenses should always be measured
by one's ability to pay them. The present crisis calls not
only for economy but also for sacrifices.</p>

<p>A people carrying on a free government in their own land,
who suppose that they are never to make any sacrifices, are
under a delusion which every effort should be made to dispel.</p>

<p>The importance of the subject of the Loan prevents its full
discussion in the present communication. But I shall, at an
early day, lay the matter before you in a special message.
Repeating my observation that the settlement of this question 
cannot be postponed beyond the present session, I have
to assure you of my hearty co-operation in this as well as in
all other questions of interest to the State.</p>
