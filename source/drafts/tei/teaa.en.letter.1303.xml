<p>April 9, 1901</p>

<p>Mr. Cridler:
Mr. Smith's original suggestion was
that the office of V.C.G. need not be filled. We
told him that it had better be filled and said
we should be pleased to appoint Mr. Spurgeon to
the position.</p>

<p>As Mr. Spurgeon is an American and
Sec. of Legation it seems to me that his appointment
as Vice Consul General would be better than
that of a foreigner, <del>even as good a man as Col.
Williams appears to be.</del></p>

<p>THE NEW AFRICA. <add>March 1900</add> 17</p>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>rred, and none have more justly merit-
<gap reason="missing"/>them then he. His many years of
<gap reason="missing"/>ominent and successful service in Libe-
<gap reason="missing"/>a, and the fat of his membership in
<gap reason="missing"/>e General Conference of 1892 and
<gap reason="missing"/>896, give him some advantage, all of
<gap reason="missing"/>hich unite to make him a presenta-
<gap reason="missing"/>ve for whom we should be proud, and
<gap reason="missing"/>he in whose hands our interests are safe.</p>

<p>THE NEW AFRICA gives its hearty en-
<gap reason="missing"/>orsement to his election, and wishes
<gap reason="missing"/>im a safe passage to and from America,
<gap reason="missing"/>d hopes that his services as our repre-
<gap reason="missing"/>ntative in the General Conference will
<gap reason="missing"/>e such as will do us and him great cred-
<gap reason="missing"/>and honor.</p>

<p>Col. Anthony D. Williams, A. M.,
<gap reason="missing"/>ho was unanimously elected lay dele-
<gap reason="missing"/>te to the General Conference is the
<gap reason="missing"/>on of the late Rev. A. D. Williams and
<gap reason="missing"/>Mary A. Lewis, sister of the late Gener-
<gap reason="missing"/>John N. Lewis. He was born at Mt.
<gap reason="missing"/>cott, Cape Palmas, December 20, 1842.
<gap reason="missing"/>t that time his father was presiding
<gap reason="missing"/>der on the Cape Palmas district. His
<gap reason="missing"/>other died over forty years ago in
<gap reason="missing"/>Monrovia, leaving him and his younger
<gap reason="missing"/>brother to the care of his father and
<gap reason="missing"/>widowed sister, Mary A. Ferguson. His
<gap reason="missing"/>ather, Rev. A. D. Williams died at
<gap reason="missing"/>Robertsport, Grand Cape Mount, while
<gap reason="missing"/>ischarging the duties there as superin-
<gap reason="missing"/>endent under the administration of the
<gap reason="missing"/>ate President S. A. Benson about forty
<gap reason="missing"/>years ago. Mr. Williams was then
<gap reason="missing"/>bout 17 years of age.</p>

<p>He attended the Monrovia Seminary,
Now the College of West Africa, under
the tutorship of the late Rev. Dr. J. W.
Horne, Principal. After Mr. Horne's 
return to the United States, young Williams
entered Alexander High School
then taught by the Rev. E. W. Blyden,
(now Dr. Blyden.) He remained there
till the opening of the Liberia College in
1860. He left college before graduating
to take the position of chief clerk in the</p>

<p>Treasury Department under the late
John H. Chavas, Sec'y of the Treasury.
He was subsequently transferred to the
State Department and served as clerk
under Hon. H. R. W. Johnson, then
Secretary of State. A few years afterwards
he was elected chief clerk of the
House of Representatives during the
Speakership of W. S. Anderson, and
served in that capacity five years. Mr.
Williams has been a member of the
National Legislature ten years, serving one
term in the House of Representatives
and two in the Senate. He was three
times a candidate for the Presidency of
the Republic. He has served also as
Secretary of War and navy, and is at
present Principal of the Preparatory
Department of Liberia College.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams has been Colonell of the
First Regiment for twelve years, and has
served in six military campaigns: He
has been a member of the Masonic Lodge
for thirty-three years, and is now Past
Deputy Grand Master of the Grand
Lodge of the Republic, also a Past Noble
Father of Russell Memorial Lodge No.
4451 G. U. O. of O. F.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams comes from good Methodist
stock, his father having been one of
the founders of the Methodist Episcopal
Church in this country. He is therefore,
a born Methodist and is thouroughly
devoted to Methodist interests. He is now
a member of the official board of the
Monrovia Methodist Episcopal church
under the Rev. J. C. Sherrill.</p>

<p>His wife, Mrs. Maria Williams who
has been his companion for thirty years,
is an active worker in the Sabbath school.
She is the founder and director of the
harity Hall for the poor. She is also
president of the modest little Christ
Hospital of Monrovia. Her interest in, and
devotion to the poor and needy have won
for her the name of "Modern Dorcas of
Monrovia."</p>

<p>Liberia College conferred the degree</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3193.jpg"/>

<p>18 <gap/> THE NEW AFRICA.</p>

<p>of A. M. upon Mr. Williams eight or
ten years ago. He gave two years of
faithful service as Principal of Monrovia
Seminary (now the College of West
Africa) under Bishop Taylor's administration.</p>

<p>All are agreed that no better selection
could have been made than the one that
has wisely been made in unanimously
electing Col. Williams to represent the
laity of our Church in the General Conference.
He has had large experience
in both curch and state, and will make
a good representative. We give him as
to our ministerial delegate our hearty
endorsement and congratulation, and wish
for him the highest success and best
results in the interest of our work in Liberia.</p>

<p>The Re-opening of Liberia
College.</p>

<p>An event of much importance in Liberian
occurrences was the formal opening
of the state institution in Monrovia.
The new president of Liberia College,
Hon. and Rev. G. W. Gibson, D. D.,
was inducted into office on Wednesday,
Feb. 21, by public cereonies in the
Providence baptist Church, and in the
presence of official representatives of
both the Republic and foreign nations.</p>

<p>President W. D. Coleman adminstered
to the new president the oath of office
and made a short address in which he
congratulated Dr. Gibson upon his appointment and upon the greater
opportunities for usefulness, which will be
afforded him in his new position. He
then in appropriate words placed under
his charge the charter, seal and keys of
the college.</p>

<p>In the course of his remarks, President
Coleman referred to the new departure,
which has been taken by the Trustees of
the College under the sanction of the
Legislature as follows:--</p>

<p>"The Legislature at its recent session passed <gap reason="missing"/>
Act to which I have had the satisfaction of <gap reason="missing"/>
fixing my official signature, which has giv<gap reason="missing"/>
to the state a more immediate and direct in<gap reason="missing"/>
est in the conduct and condition of Liberia <gap reason="missing"/>
ledge than has ever before attached to them. <gap reason="missing"/>
refer to the Act making certain appropriatio<gap reason="missing"/>
from the public revenue for the support of<gap reason="missing"/>
institution."</p>

<p>Dr. Gibson followed the President <gap reason="missing"/>
an able Inaugural address, in which <gap reason="missing"/>
ply to the remarks of the President <gap reason="missing"/>
said:--</p>

<p>"MR. PRESIDENT: In accepting the symb<gap reason="missing"/>
of the sacred trust which has been commit<gap reason="missing"/>
to me, I need not assure you Sir, that I am <gap reason="missing"/>
only deeply sensible of the honor which<gap reason="missing"/>
been conferred upon me, but am burdened w<gap reason="missing"/>
a sense of the solemn responsibility it impre<gap reason="missing"/>
es, I am encouraged however, by the thou<gap reason="missing"/>
that I have the sympathy of yourself and<gap reason="missing"/>
Government in the arduous and difficult du<gap reason="missing"/>
which lie before me; and the presence of <gap reason="missing"/>
assembly assures me that this sympathy is sha<gap reason="missing"/>
by my fellow citizens, in whose co-operation <gap reason="missing"/>
am inclined to hope and may rely.</p>

<p>But relying still more upon that Higher P<gap reason="missing"/>
er, without whom they labor in vain tha b<gap reason="missing"/>
the house, I feel that under His watchful<gap reason="missing"/>
and guidance, I may enter upon the task ass<gap reason="missing"/>
ed me with hope and faith.</p>

<p>President Gibson then gave a brief <gap reason="missing"/>
interesting account of the origin of <gap reason="missing"/>
beria College, and made the follow <gap reason="missing"/>
statement as to the recent action of <gap reason="missing"/>
Legislature:</p>

<p>I am unwilling to close these remarks w<gap reason="missing"/>
out recording a well-deserved tribute of resp<gap reason="missing"/>
for the session of our National Legislat<gap reason="missing"/>
which so warmly responded to the appeal<gap reason="missing"/>
the President in setting apart a a portion of<gap reason="missing"/>
revenue for the special support of the colle<gap reason="missing"/>
That Body passed an Act, providing that <gap reason="missing"/>
half of the export duty on Piassava and one <gap reason="missing"/>
of the proceeds of the sales of Public La<gap reason="missing"/>
and all escheated property be set apart as<gap reason="missing"/>
endowment fund for this purpose. And we<gap reason="missing"/>
assured by influential members of that ass<gap reason="missing"/>
bly that if the income from these sources <gap reason="missing"/>
found to be insufficient for the object cont<gap reason="missing"/>
plated, they are willing to appropriate more.<gap reason="missing"/></p>

tude of Liberia College to the other <gap reason="missing"/></p>

<p>Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
West Coast, Africa.
March 8, 1901.</p>

<p>The Barnes Undertaking Company,
No. 293 South Lincoln Street,
Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>Sirs,
I have the honor to say that your letters of December
13, and 27, 1900, to the State Department, Washington,
relative to the remains, expenses etc. of the late Beverly
Y. Payne, of Liberia, late Vice Consul General of the United
States to Liberia, reached me March 7, 1901. I have just
to-day, March 8, 1901, had an interview with the legal
representatives of the deceased. They say they notified Mrs.
Amanda Smith, North Harvey, 11, by cable, through their
New York agents, Messrs. Yates and Porterfield, Williams
St., New York City, not later than Nov. 8, 1900, to have the
remains interred in America. Mr. E. W. McGill, Collegtor of
Customs for this port; and brother-in-law to the late Beverly
G. Prague, says he wrote you sometime since (probably
trhough Mrs. Amanda Smith) advising that the remains be
interred and a statement of expenses etc. be forwarded to him
for settlement. He complains that he has not yet received a</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3195.jpg"/>

<p>reply. He now asks that you write him direct, through this
Legation, giving a full statement of expenses, etc. and
proper arrangements will be made to meet same.</p>

<p>Hoping an early reply etc., I have the honor to be,
Yours, etc.,
Owen L. W. Smith,
U.S. Consul-General.</p>
