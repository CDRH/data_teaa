<p>Christian Missions.</p>

<p>Many of the English missionary societies laboring in Africa are
experiencing serious trials in connection with the sickness and death
of several of their missionaries and also from newly awakened hostility 
on the part of the native chieftains. Bishop Parker, of the English
Church Missionary Society, lately died of fever at the southern end
of Victoria Nyanza. Following so soon upon the murder of Bishop
Hamington, the death of his successor will be a sad blow to the Church
Missionary Society. Moreover, all the stations of this Society in East 
Africa, as well as of the London Society on lake Tanganyika, have
experienced severe trials of late in connection with the <hi rend="italics">hongo</hi>, or
claims for tribute, made by the native chieftains. The Free Church
of Scotland's mission on Lake Nyasa has been compelled to suspend
its missionary operations, and to attend solely to self-defence against 
the assaults of Arab slave-traders, who have entered anew and with
vigor upon their infamous traffic. The losses by death of English
Baptist missionaries on the Congo have been so numerous as to be
well nigh crushing.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italics">Societe des Missions Evangeliques</hi> has sent four French teachers 
as aids to the American Presbyterian Mission at the Gaboon. This
mission, founded in 1842, has now six stations: Alongo, upon the island 
of Corisco; Baraka, or Glars, upon the equator; Angoma, upon
the Gaboon river, and Kangwe, on the river Ogowe. The French
teachers have received a hearty welcome from the French authorities
of the country as well as from the American missionaries. It has become 
an absolute necessity that the French language should be used
in the mission schools.</p>

<p>The missionaries of the American Baptist Missionary Union on<!-- START HERE -->
the Congo further report of the revival at Banza Manteke. About
two hundred have been baptized and enrolled as church members.
More are asking for baptism. An interesting incident is given show-
ing the zeal of the converts in transporting timber and iron a distance
of fifty miles for the building of a chapel. Most of the men have
made the journey three, and some four times, bringing loads on 
their heads. To do this requires a walk of three or four hundred
miles. The women have hired carriers, and thus have done their 
part. The boys, too, have brought half-loads.</p>

<p>Bishop William Taylor in his Quadrennial Report to the Gener-
al Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, says that he had
superintended the regular work in the Liberia Conference and estab-
lished self-supporting missions on the Cavalla river. He has made
a beginning in the Congo region, and Angola south of the Congo riv-</p>
