affording the only goodanchorage in

<p>It is only for a few years past that
the exportation of Grand or Pea-Tuss

country. France is the principal
<unclear/> and mostly for <unclear/>
purposes and its <unclear/> gave
employment in the past year to 
18,800 tons of French shipping.</p>
    
<p>As is will Riveria the quantity used 
in the United States for manufavtur-
ing or <unclear/> purposes is very
small, owing chiefly to the heavy in-
port duty of fifteen per <unclear/> as
<unclear/>. What an opening (in a
small way) for the employment 
of the surplus shipping of the United 
States. what a benefit to <unclear/> 
were those duties abolished: the pro-
ducers on the United States would
perhaps suffer but would not be
nemefot to shipping and manufacturers
more than counterbalance, any state-
ment to the agriculturist.</p>
