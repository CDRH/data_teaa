<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
January 15 1884</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Mr du Verge by letter dated
Novr 3 1883, of which copy is herewith
enclosed, having informed me that he
intended to proceed to the United States
on leave of absence granted to him
by the Department, and being now in
charge of the Consulate, I have to
acknowledge the receipt of your
despatch No 20 of the 26th October
last, informing Mr du Verge that his
nomination of Francisco <unclear>Marhus</unclear> Pivart
as Vice Consul to succeed me has been 
approved, and enclosing a black form
of bond which should be executed and 
<catchwords>returned</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30007"/>

returned to the Department of State 
with information as to Mr Swart's 
nationality.</p>

<p>In compliance with this request I have
to inform you that Mr Swart is a 
Portuguese subject and a merchant
of this place, holding the appointment
of Spanish Vice Consul, but left for 
Europe in the month of July last
and is still absent; and I have not
any means of knowing the exact date
he intends to return, or whether as
is rumoured, he purposes residing
permanently in Lisbon.</p>

<p>I have therefore the honor to return 
<del>the blank</del> the blank force of bond
for such ulterior measures as may be
deemed fit.</p>

<p>Having thus become acquainted with 
the

<pb n="Scan30008"/>

the fact of being suspended without
having rendered my resignation, or
informed in anyway by Mr du Verge
of his having nominated Mr Swart
to fulfil the duties of Vice Consul&#8212;an
appointment not intimated to or 
acknowledged by the local Government&#8212;
I am reluctantly compelled to conclude 
that the Department must have been 
altogether misinformed on the subject,
and the representations made by 
Mr du Verge a compilation of
mistatements, which would appear
to be a leading characteristic of that 
officer in nearly all transactions
connected with his proceedings when
here.</p>

<p>As however Mr du Verge has
taken with him the official 
<catchwords>correspondence</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30009"/>

correspondence book and the various 
despatches, prior to the one now adverted
to, I am unable to see on what grounds 
he demanded my substitution, after a 
service which has, for the last fourteen 
years been approved of by the Government</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I 
have to submit whether, conformably
with official procedure, and as a matter
of personal satisfaction, the Department
will not, prior to re-confirming
Mr. Swart's nomination, transmit to 
me a copy of Mr du Verge's despatch or despatches
on the subject, in order that I may
offer such explanations as the case
warrants.</p>

<p>Mr du Verge may or may 
not have been actuated by 
consideration of a higher nature
<catchwords>than</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30010"/>

than personal disappointment at
finding me unwilling to connect
him with my commercial house,
and although he had no grounds
for such expectations, his subsequent
proceedings in the Congo (where he
was employed at a salary, I understand
of £400 a year) as chief of the Vivi 
station of the Stanley Expedition, and
his compulsory retirement from that
post at the request of Major General
Sir Frederick Goldsmid, who came
out to the Congo last year, on a special
mission from the King of the Belgians,
have not tended to produce that 
confidence which should have
distinguished an officer of the Consular
Service, and who had not gained the 
consideration or respect either of the 
<catchwords>Governor</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30011"/>    

Governor General of this Province or
of the higher class of inhabitants of
this town.</p>

<p>I  have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant<lb/>
Robt S. Newton<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul</p>

<p>Robert S. Newton Esqr<lb/>
U.S. Vice Consul<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I beg to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter, and to thank you for
all the letters and papers you have
forwarded me since my departure.</p>

<p>I would also state that I am
learning for Europe and the United
States by the first English or Portuguese
mail steamer, according to leave of
absence received from the Department
of State</p>

<p><catchwords>As</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30013"/> 

As soon as I have answered
all my despatches, and get my reports
&amp;c &amp;c on the Congo sent home I will
forward you the United States Despatch
Book and Seal, and will thank you
to be good enough upon receiving the
same to send me a full receipt
and also an Inventory of all property
belonging to the Untied States
Government which I delivered to you
when leaving St Paul de Loanda.</p>

<p>Trusting you will still keep
good health, and that your business
will increase daily</p>

<p>I remain Sir<lb/>
Yours respectfully<lb/>
(Signed) L de R du Verge</p>
