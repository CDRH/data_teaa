<p>Belgium Legation</p>
    
<p>Hamilton, Mass.
25 June 1906</p>
    
<p>Sir Knight,</p>
    
<p>In accordance with the
instructions I left you with,
Mr. Nerincx telegraphed you
immediately about the Washington nomination for the Consul General
of the United States of America in Boma, the moment when  
the Department of State published it 
in a statement to the newspapers,
which you will find a sample attached 
in this telegraph.</p>

<p>The designated candidate for 
this new post Mr. Clarence R.
Slocum, of New York, he is actually 
still the Consul <unclear></unclear>  
in Weimar. His promotion of Consul
General in Boma will not be definitive
until after the confirmation by the Senate;
but this ratification doesn't seem 
doubtful to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Slocumm's choice was announced 
by the Department of State in
terms that allow one to think  
that this nomination is a personal
designation of Mr. Root (who recently 
told me again of his intention to 
chose a serious candidate) and that
she constitutes more a new éspec.
for our Boston adversaries.</p>

<p>The statement reports in
fact that despite the reproach of
the Congo Reform Association, the Secretary
of State did not decide on the creation 
of this Boma post after being
assured the good will of the Independant
State,&#8212; he then decided 
to name a candidate to this post 
clear of influences of this antagonistic 
association, &#8212; and again 
today, despite the steps and
the authority in which the Congo Reform
Association preoccupies, the Secretary of
State declared to these reformers
that he is sticking to his manner of 
seeing things about this Congolese issue as
he had made known
earlier.</p>

<p>The same report adds 
that the welcome given to the proposed 
candidates by the Secretary of the Congo 
Reform Association, Mr. Daniels, has  
not been in the least encouraging.</p>

<p>Please, Sir Knight, accept the insurance 
of my very highest consideration.</p>
