Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to state that by the British
Mail S.S. Bosmy which arrived on the 4th
inst 3 Men a young boy and a girl all
from Dondo; and who accompanied the
German explores Lieut Weissmann in
crossing Africa from Dondo; have returned
in good health, they report that their 
voyage across was very pleasant, and
that they never had nay troubles with
the Natives of the interior. that all
the chiefs received them very well; although
they had no presents to give them.
and that from tribe to tribe they
were accompanied by some chiefs. They
went to Zanzibar where they were put
on board the British S.S. "Chittagong"
with about 250 more Zanzibarians
under the command of a Belgian
called Capt. Cambier, for Mr. Henry 
Mr. Stanley expedition and where 
landed at Banana on the Congo

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0204.003"/>

and proceeded at once to Mr. Henry M.
Stanley Head quarters <del>and</del>.</p>

<p>The British Mail S.S. Bosmy brought
Mr. Weissman followers here.</p>

<p>The strong impression here is: that a great 
disturbance is expected on the upper
Congo very soon.</p>

<p>Eleven New German House have established
themselves between Gaboon and Ambrizette
and it is reported that another monthly 
line of Steamer from Hamburg will run
between that place and the West cast
as far as Ambrizette. Five Belgian houses
are also established since my arrival 
here.</p>

<p>With the expectations of the troubles in
the interior, the Ivory and others produce
have been keep back, and freight on the
coast very hard to be obtained for the
present. which leave some of the large
commission merchants in a very bad
state and I am expecting daily to
hear of some failures in Loanda.</p>

<p>It would be in my opinion the best
moment for Americans enterprising
man from some good firm in America
to come and start four trading post
on the Coast and making its head

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0204.004"/>

quarters at Loanda. With money now and
Am: goods a firm can triple her capital
in <unclear>two</unclear> years. But they must recollect that
Americans coming here, must have a good
knowledge of the Portuguese language.</p>

<p>With this qualification, of course, a thorough
business man would soon become familiar
with the business methods of the place,
peculiarities of tariffs &amp;ca &amp;ca</p>

<p>I would also state that Vice Consul
Robert S. Newton has returned form 
England as the British Vice Consul, and
has not yet reported himself to me.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
L. de R. du Verge<lb/>
US Consul</p>
