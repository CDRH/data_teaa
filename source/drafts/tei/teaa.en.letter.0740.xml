<note>Department of State Received Mar 2 1885</note>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
Loanda, 30 December 1884.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose translation of a despatch
received from His Excellency the Governor General in reply to
a despatch I wrote him, with reference to the American
Mission lately expelled from Bailunda &amp; Bihé. Since that
date Mr Walters, Chief of the Mission has been here and I 
presented him personally to His Excellency the Governor, &amp; the
Governor has promised to do all in his power to assist the
Mission and has given Mr Walters a document with the
private seal of the Government attached, to the chiefs of
Bailunda &amp; Bihé requesting them to do all in their power to
assist the Mission and informing the said chiefs that any
persons presenting themselves for the future as representing
the Government, must present a similar seal before they are
to be recognised as such. Mr Walters has returned to
Benguella and seems to think he will not have much
trouble for the future. Mr Saunders another member of
the Mission has returned to Bailunda and they appear
to have great hopes of recovering the greater part of their
property.</p>

<p>The Governor has also offered to give the
Mission a grant of land to the extent of 1000 hectares
<catchwords>or</catchwords></p>
