<note>Department of State Received Mar 2 1885</note>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
Loanda, 30 December 1884.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose translation of a despatch
received from His Excellency the Governor General in reply to
a despatch I wrote him, with reference to the American
Mission lately expelled from Bailunda &amp; Bihé. Since that
date Mr Walters, Chief of the Mission has been here and I 
presented him personally to His Excellency the Governor, &amp; the
Governor has promised to do all in his power to assist the
Mission and has given Mr Walters a document with the
private seal of the Government attached, to the Chiefs of
Bailunda &amp; Bihé requesting them to do all in their power to
assist the Mission and informing the said Chiefs that any
persons presenting themselves for the future as representing
the Government, must present a similar seal before they are
to be recognised as such. Mr Walters has returned to
Benguella and seems to think he will not have much
trouble for the future. Mr Saunders another member of
the Mission has returned to Bailunda and they appear
to have great hopes of recovering the greater part of their
property.</p>

<p>The Governor has also offered to give the
Mission a grant of land to the extent of 1000 hectares
<catchwords>or</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50006"/> 

or 2400 acres, should they wish to establish an Industrial School
at Benguella or elsewhere within the province.</p>

<p>The U.S. Vessel of War "Kersage", I hear was in the Congo
a few days ago, but did not come as far South as Loanda</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Your most obedient Servant<lb/>

<note>Translation</note>

<note>Department of State Received Mar 2 1885</note>

<p>Loanda<lb/>
November 18 1884</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I received your despatch of the
17th ult in which you not only enclosed
the guarantees that the American
Mission wishes to re-establish itself
in Bailundo, but even an account
of the effects and their value lost
by the mission, which are supposed
to be in possession of the Sobba who
is held to be responsible for them.
No one saw with greater regret than
myself, that the Sobba of Bailudo
could commit the same violence to
the American Missionaries as he has
at times committed on the Portuguese
merchants and which certainly, neither
you Sir, nor the Mission can think 
that such violences could have been ordered
authorised or even insinuated either by
me or any other Portuguese with the
least investiture of authority. Of 
<catchwords>this</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50008"/> 

this the missionaries ought to be convinced
as the governor of Benguella has more
than once repeated it, and this I now
confirm</p>

<p>In the interior the Sobbas far from
the sight of civilised authority, commit
thefts and extortions, that constitute one
of the greatest risks of one employed
in the civilisation of the African races
who as savages are eminently suspicions
and no one can certainly make the
European Authorities responsible for 
this special character, at most times
excited in their malpractices by political
intention and some times ostensible, at
others secretly manifested for the
travellers and missionaries who
parting from the scientific sphere
or from preaching the Gospel
give to their position in the
interior an irritant situation of which
anyone can imagine with more or
less accuracy when he judges himself
prejudiced by these intentions, in his
interests, and especially that <catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50009"/> 

of commercial gain</p>

<p>By what is affirmed by the missionaries,
it appears that they were given notice
to leave Bailundo in eight days and
even then they stayed six weeks, and
it seems only rational that during
that time they should have sent
one of their members to Benguella
to obtain a letter from the
Governor to the Sobba to assure
him that in whatever intrigues 
my name or that Governor's might
be involved, had no foundation whatever
and was utterly false.</p>

<p>This the missionaries did not do and
consequently they have only themselves
to blame. What part the Portuguese
merchant Braga might have had in
the matter that very much I lament
to have been the determination of the
Sobba of Bailundo, I cannot tell
you, as I await information from
the Governor of Benguella who left
for the interior with the intention
of complaining of the affair and
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50010"/>

to relate personally what had taken
place to enable me to do entire justice.
At present we have the simple
declaration of the missionaries, there
is yet to be heard the Sobba, and 
it is this that I enjoined the 
Governor to do.</p>

<p>The habitual complaint of the
merchants of Benguella is that
the American Mission tried by
every possible means to deviate 
the flow of commerce from Bengulla,
and this might perchance have
influenced the spirit of one less
cautious to have provoked the
Sobba and his ministers to do what
they did, thus giving them a pretext,
which until to day they have
not wanted, to behave in a 
like manner to some of the Portuguese
merchants, under futile reasons of
"fetish" that have only had their
origin from the <sic>coveteousness</sic> and
greediness of the heathen population, always
incited by the knowledge that they may 
<catchwords>have</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50011"/>

have of the existence of goods in the
hands of the inland trader.</p>

<p>The experienced opinion of Silva Portó
is that what has now occurred to the
American Mission he had long thought
one day would happen as he well
knows the character of the Bailundos,
not being able to state if the affair
really occurred as the missionaries state
or even if any Portuguese merchants
directly or indirectly took part.
The comportment of this <sic>illustrous</sic> 
Portuguese settler to the English Missionary
whose letter you enclose in one of your
despatches to which I reply wakes his
statement altogether beyond questioning
as he offered him his house in Bihé to
stop as long as he pleased so long as he
only preached the gospel and did not
enter into politics, for from the moment
he did he would have to leave the
house in order not to compromise Silva
Porto with the natives</p>

<p>Not less is the complaint of the Sobba
against the American Missionaries concerning
<catchwords>their</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50012"/>

political interference than is the
complaint of the Merchants of
Benguella concerning the supposed
meddling in trade to which I already
referred and therefore it will be
much better that at the missionaries
on their return to Bailundo make
a solemn declaration or oath according
to their religion before <sic>witnessess</sic> and
the authorities that they do not intend
to influence in any prejudicial way
the trade of Benguella, but that they 
simply go to preach the Gospel and
the doctrine of Christ. The oath that
I suggest would for my part be
perfectly unnecessary but the public 
spirit in the country is irritated
against the missionaries, and in
as much as such a promise would 
be a means of pacifying and
dispersing any doubts that may remain
and which certainly can cost nothing
to the conciliating and Evangelical spirit
of the missionaries</p>

<p>As you Sir, can well imagine I cannot 
<catchwords>give</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50013"/>

give a decisive opinion upon the
subject without first having the
report of the Governor of Benguella's
voyage into the interior, nor can I 
guarantee the behavior of the Sobba
and have not sufficient forces in 
Bailundo, and much less can I
exact from him the payment that
the mission claims.</p>

<p>The mission established itself in the
interior without consulting the Portuguese
government as to what port of guarantee
it might have for its members and property,
ran of its own accord the risk inherent
to the kind of exploration in which it 
was engaged. If the government had
been consulted it would most certainly
have said that the natives of Bailundo
are treacherous and that only by a 
miracle could the missionaries uphold
themselves, more so as soon as the Mission
had a means and especially that of goods,
incentive to the habitual malpractices
of the native.</p>

<p>The American Mission can then when 
<catchwords>it</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50014"/>

likes, establish itself where best it thinks
fit; what the Portuguese government 
cannot do is to guarantee that
the Sobba shall not repeat his violences
because that, no country could do
to which he was a vassal, nor could
it keep a competent military force the
expense of which no mission could
compensate</p>

<p>What the Portuguese government can
and will do as soon as it has
properly heard the question is to
place regular authorities in Bailundo
and Bihé to maintain the equilibrium
of intercourse between the Sobba and 
Merchants or Missionaries, and so
forewarn itself by trustworthy
notices &amp; reports against the affirmations
of other contradictory parties, and
in that case while the Portuguese
Government act like this they will
have to limit the guarantee that
they offers to those establishing themselves 
in Bihé and Bailundo,
which can reasonably be claimed
<catchwords>taking</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50015"/>

taking into consideration the state of
the people of these two districts at the 
same time noting that the guarantee
will be entire in the districts like
Cacondo &amp; Quillengues where the preaching
of the gospel would be as useful as
in Bailundo or Bihé, and that will
have to be combined between the
interested parties and the native 
authorities of the place before a Portuguese
authority that will be placed there,
when missionaries or merchants wish
to establish themselves in neighbourhoods
where only reigns native customs, simply
restricted by vassalage sworn to the
King of Portugal</p>

<p>As to the English Missionary
the writer of the letter to which
I have already referred, it appears
to me that the prestige of the settler
Silva Porto to whom he is much indebted
and from whom he has derived great
help to him it ought to be sufficient
guarantee to affirm, that as much
to him and his subordinates, or even 
<catchwords>others</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50016"/>

independent of him, that they
will not have to complain of
any interference in their work
of civilisation, so long as they
keep themselves to that, and do 
not interfere in politics whether
native or European, in which case
the Portuguese government cannot
be responsible in anyway whatever
for the behaviour of the savage
tribes, amongst whom they may
establish their theatre of operation
contrary to its ostensible ends.</p>
