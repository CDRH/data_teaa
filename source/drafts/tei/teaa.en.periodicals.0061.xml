<div2 type="titles">Free Rum on the Congo

<p>Mr. W.T. Hornaday's book on this subject is published by the 
   Women's Temperance Publication Association. It is a terrible tale
   of sin and misery, equal in moral and physical horror to the awful
   story of free opium in China. In the New York Tribune there is 
   an extended notice of Mr. Hornaday's book which says that "When
   a number of States meet together in international council it may
   easily happen that the ethical standard finally dominating the pro-
   ceedings is as much below the average of popular morality.
   This was very clearly the case at that Berlin Conference of 1884-85
   which adopted the principle of free trade for the Congo, and in so
   doing at one stroke deprived the Congo Free State of a revenue for 
   subsistence and threw Africa open to a crusade of debauchery. No
   more humiliating spectacle is often afforded teh world that was ex-
   hibited on this occasion; when the United States and Great Britain
   vainly protested against the monstrous wrong projected against help-
   less heathendom by all powerful Christendom, and when the Ger-
   man and Dutch makers and sellers of the vilest alcoholic poisons,
   literally dictated their own terms to the Great Powers, and secured
   solemn assent to the infamous principle that the right to sell rum
   on the Congo without restriction was of more importance than the 
   right of the African people to protection against physical and men-
   tal ruin.

    "The evil work was consumated, however, and ever since a river
   of rum, broad and deep almost as the Congo itself, has been pouring
   into Africa. This is the first civilizing step taken by the Christian
   Powers since the abolition of slavery. As the evidence brought
   together by Mr. Hornaday in his telling little book clearly shows, the 
   question of free rum on the Congo is rapidly assuming a gravity not
   even second slavery. It may be that through the slavery
   of the past a considerable part of the negro family will ultimately be
   raised to real civilization, enlightenment and prosperity. But no
   future good can by any possibility spring from the present evil of free</p>

<p>rum on the Congo. The African races have a natural passion for
   intoxicants, and their climate is deadly to drinkers. These two facts 
   are the keys to the whole situation. Rum has been welcomed by
   these grown-up children with fearful avidity. So eagerly is it sought,
   so precious is it held, that in many parts of Africa it has become the
   currency of the country. For purposes of barter it has superceded
   cloth and beads and everything else. Traders who have taken car-
   avans into the interior loaded with the usual articles of truck have 
   been obliged to return to the coast because the natives refused 
   everything but rum.

    "Mr. Hornaday gives statistics which show that in one year-1885-
   over 10,000,000 gallons of alcohol liquors were exported by the
   United States, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Great Britain,
   to the Congo country. It is true that Germany and the Netherlands
   shipped by far the greater portion of the filthy stuff, their share
   amounting to 8,000,000 out of 10,000,000 gallons. It is to keep the
   way open for this abominable German and Dutch traffic that the
   other nations are discrediting themselves by participation in the
   shameful policy of free rum. Not that the United States and
   England are themselves guiltless. In the year named above New
   England rum to the amount of 737,650 gallons found its way to the
   Congo, and Great Britain sent 311,384 gallons. Neither the one nor
   the other quantity is considerable enough to afford even the most
   conscienceless kind is obviously the controlling influence in the case
   of Germany and Holland, but America and England are plainly sacri-
   ficing their characters and soiling their records only that some greedy
   and brutal foreign traders may be enriched thorugh the ruin of the 
   Negroes.

   "There are in the Congo Basin just about as many people as in
   the United States at the last census. How many there will be ten
   years hence, however, is quite another consideration. In what we
   call civilization at home, population increases in a known ratio. In
   what we call civilization abroad, population shrinks with appalling 
   rapidity. The Christian's rum has blasted savage races all over the
   globe. They wither under its destructive contact. At the rate it is
   now being poured into the Congo country only the usual results can 
   be anticipated.

   "The remedial measure proposed by Mr. Hornaday is a new
   conference of all the Powers to restrict and control the rum traffic.
   In considering the probabilities of success in such an undertaking, it</p>

<pb xml:id="3" facs="African Repository 1888.4.1 - Free Rum on the Congo.pdf"/>

<p>must be remembered that the United States, Great Britain, Italy and
   Belgium, are already committed against free rum on the Congo. Ger-
   many and the Netherlands are the obstacles to Christian legislation.
   With them the apparent controlling motive is naked greed of gain.
   The question is whether these recalcitrant Powers can be persuaded
   or shamed into abandoning the position they have taken; whether
   they can be induced to confront the wrath of their rum makers and
   sellers, in short.

   "Free rum on the Congo could only be defended under a system
   of devil-worship. No consistent Christian can possibly excuse or
   abstain from denouncing it. But if Christendom by mere inaction
   suffers the evil to survive and spread, what is the religion worth?
   The question is compact and clear. The churches must take it up.
   It is emphatically their business. But it is also the business of every
   man and woman who respects and believes in modern civilization, and
   who has any feeling for humanity beyond what a savage possesses.
   As the case stands free rum must flourish on the Congo for twenty
   years unless the General Act of the Berlin Conference is superseded
   by fresh legislation. If, however, nothing is done to check the
   abominable traffic, it is evident that in much less than twenty years
   the inhabitants of the Congo Basin will have been fatally corrupted.
   Prompt, vigorous, and general action,is demanded, and to the end
   the facts may be made known we hope that a wide circulation
   will be given Mr. Hornaday' sstriking account of the situation."</p>
