<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to 
acknowledge your circular despatch 
of July 26th last, conveying 
the sad intelligence of the death
of Mr Wm Hunter, the Second
Assistant Secretary of State.</p>

<p>I beg respectfully to sympathize
with the Department in the loss
of so old and able a colleague.</p>

<p>Your instructions as to display
of symbols of mourning are obeyed.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>

<p>Requesting leave of absence.</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.</p>

<p>Requesting leave of absence from 
December next to March 1887.
Nominates for appointment
by Department during his
absence Edward Bannister.
Asks for standing permission
to take leave of absence when
circumstances compel his
departure.</p>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
30th September 1886</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to request
the Department to grant me leave of 
absence. I wish to take my wife to 
England in December next as I find
the climate does not agree with his,
and as I intend returning in March
next, I shall be absent only three or
four months.</p>

<p>I beg alas to request the Department 
to allow me the liberty to
nominate my chief clerk in my
commercial business, Mr Edward
Bannister, to act as Vice Concil 
during my absence, Mr Bent who
formerly acted being no longer in 
my

<pb facs="Scan60025"/>

my employ and not likely to return
to Loanda.</p>

<p>As I have been here now nearly
twenty years I find it necessary that
I should visit a cold climate more
frequently than I have hitherto done
and when last at home my Doctor
recommended that I should at
least try and take a run home once
a year.</p>

<p>In consideration of these circumstances, 
the unhealthy nature
of this locality, and the long since
I have resided here I take the liberty
to solicit the Department for a standing
permission to take leave of absence
whenever circumstances compel
my departure from this place.</p>

<p>This request may appear to be

<pb facs="Scan60026"/>

a departure from the general
custom of the Department, but
I trust that the special nature
of the case may induce you to
take the matter into favorable
consideration.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your most obedient servant<lb/>
Robt S. Newton<lb/>

<p>Report on Trade and Commerce
of the Province of Angola</p>

<note>(Copied. December 1886).</note>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
30th September 1886</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to submit
to the Department the following concise 
report on the Trade and Commerce
of the Province of Angola, confining
myself more particularly to that part
of the province in the immediate
vicinity of the Capital, Loanda.</p>

<p>We are passing through
a crisis at present which for the
last two years has been very severely
felt and which recurs once in about
every ten or eleven years, consequent
on what may be termed a gradual 
<catchwords>rise</catchwords>

<fw type="address">To the
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington
D.C.</fw>

<pb facs="Scan70002"/>

rise and fall in the rainy reasons.
During the year 1885 the rains were 
very light, and this year they have
been lighter still. The small rains
usually commence in September and
end the latter end of November or
beginning of December, and the heavy
rains commence in February and
end in the middle of May.</p>

<p>Such light rain falls have not 
been known for twenty years, but
we may now look for a gradual
increase in quantity up to the
year 1890, and again a gradual
diminution after that year until
a drought is again experienced.</p>

<p>These influences on agriculture
may be appreciated, and as the 
principal products of the country 
<catchwords>are</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70003"/>

are vegetable, want of hair has
caused complete stagnation in
trade and commerce. Add to this
the very low prices Coffee, Oil, and 
Rubber have commanded in European
markets and the cause of the crisis is
plain</p>

<p>Exports. The exports are principally 
Coffee, rubber, palm oil,
coton, <del>rubber</del> and bees-wax. The
most important however is coffee, a
large amount of capital being expended
in its growth. It is mostly exported
to Portugal and consequently gives employment 
to some Portuguese shipping.</p>

<p>But little of the produce of the 
province is shipped to other countries. 
The total value of exports from
Loanda during 1885 was $897,930 0/00
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70004"/>

as against $1,234.900 0/00 in 1884.</p>

<p>The following table shows countries 
to which produce was exported
with valves.</p>

<p>We can calculate only on one
vessel a year from the states and
that vessel is the barque "Horace
Scudder" of Boston. She is loaded
by her owner with the articles
mentioned and sundries comprising
<unclear>tar</unclear>, <unclear>lard</unclear>, clocks, biscuits &amp;c.
She does not as a rule sell all her
cargo here. Timber as a rule,
sells readily but is by no means
a certain sale. Soap and petroleum 
<catchwords>also</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70006"/>

also generally find a ready sale.
She takes from here drafts in payment,
and on reaching Gaboon
after calling at intermediate ports
<unclear extent="one word"/> red-wood and loads with
that and what ebony she can
get, for the States. She left here
early in the year and we may look
for her again in November or
December. As trade improves better
sales may be made, but not some
goods, or qualities of goods that are
frequently sent here. The idea seems
to prevail that the damaged and very
inferior goods are suitable enough
for this market. This is a mistake
and damages the reputation of 
the United States as a source of 
supply, and I have frequently 
<catchwords>complained</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70007"/>

complained to captains and
supercargoes for so carelessly and
recklessly injuring the good names
and commercial reputation of
their country. I will substantiate
my remarks by giving my frequent
experience in one article, viz - flour.
A considerable quantity is brought
in United States vessels from time
to time, but is generally more or less
damaged, or of very inferior quality. 
The consequence is that instead of
finding a ready sale at good prices
it is with the utmost difficulty 
that purchasers can be found
for small quantities at low prices
and this is used to mix with
Portuguese flour in small quantities 
and to make very inferior
<catchwords>bread</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70008"/>

bread which is need for convicts
and prisoner's rations.</p>

<p>Besides coffee a great quantity
of sugar cane is grown in the colony 
from which rum is distilled and is
an important article of domestic
trade, but little being imported
from other countries.</p>

<p>The differential duties make
direct trade with this province from 
other countries somewhat disadvantageous, 
principally however
to the shipping interest in most
cases. These duties operate as
follows: On goods manufactured 
in any other country than
Portugal and imported direct
form that country in other than
Portuguese vessels the whole amount

<pb facs="Scan70009"/>

of duty according to the tariff is 
passable. If, being of foreign manufacture, 
they pass through the custom house in Lisbon and are reshipped 
thence in Portuguese Vessels
they pay 2% ad valorum in Lisbon
and 70% here, of the duty. If <unclear>of</unclear>
Portuguese manufacture and shipped
in Portuguese vessels, they pay 
only 2% in Lisbon and 30% here.</p>

<p>On the 28th of last month
the anniversary of the birth of the
Prince Royal of Portugal, the
inauguration of the West African
Telegraph Cable look place, and
on or about the 16th of this month
the Railway from Loanda to Ambaca 
will be inaugurated. The 
contractor for the construction of
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70010"/>

the line is Mr John Burnay of
Lisbon and <unclear>Oposs</unclear>; The sub-contractor 
being Col: D. E. Davenport
an American, at present here, and
having offices at 2 Moorgate St.
London. He is daily expecting two
longe vessels from the states with
material for construction, and I 
can see no reason why merchants
and manufactures in the states,
of such goods as will be required
not only in construction but in
the maintenance of the line, stations,
rolling stock and stores should
not compete for the furnishing
of same.</p>

<p>The agriculture of the country
is in the most primitive state still,
and only on coffee and sugar-cane
<catchwords>estates</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70011"/>

estates is some attention paid
to improvements and even there
much more might be done.</p>

<p>A very enterprising missionary 
from the United States, Bishop
William Taylor arrived here some
two years ago with a few families 
and single people who are located
by the bishop in places chosen as
being suitable for farms and the
raising of live stock. He has got
<unclear extent="one word"/> ploughs, materials for taming
and many other useful implements.
He not only expects to make these
stations self supporting but also
as schools for instructing the natives,
and teaching them farming, <unclear extent="one word"/>,
boat making, carpentering and
other industries and occupations.
<catchwords>I</catchwords> 

<pb facs="Scan70012"/>

I have had intimate relations 
with him commercially
and as Vice Consul and have
been much struck at the great
energy displayed by a man
of his years, and the faith
he has in his enterprises.</p>

<p>It is sincerely to be hoped that
the ultimate results may be
as successful as the venerable,
energetic and devoutly christian
promoter and leader both
desires and deserves.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to
inform the Department that
the work of construction of the
Railway from Loanda to Ambaca,
and styled the Royal Trans-African 
Railway, was inaugurated
on the 31st ultimo by the Governor 
General of the  Province, assisted
by the Bishop of Angola and
Congo, and the principal officials
of the Province.</p>

<p>The first sod was cut and
the first stone laid on the site
intended for the construction
of the principal station, by
the Governor General, and a 
religious ceremony calling for
divine blessing on the work 
<catchwords>was</catchwords>

was performed by the Bishop.</p>

<p>The works are commerced
and large members of natives
and others employed; and it is
expected the line will be ready
for traffic within the time
mentioned in the contract,
viz: four years.</p>

<p>A vessel with a cargo of
material for constructions is
expected every day from the
states, and most likely as the
work progresses other product
of the United States will be in
requisition.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the
Department, on my arrival here, that
this Consulate possessed no property
belonging to the Government, except
that mentioned no inventory enclosed
in despatch No 5, under date of Oct
1st, 1887.</p>

<p>The fact that Vice Consul Newton
is the British Consul and at the

house, has been no reason
for the U.S. Consulate being, in a 
sense, an adjustment, and has removed
any recognized necessity for the

<p>To enable me to perform the duties

the exigency, tho purchase as per before
mentioned <unclear>Form</unclear>.</p>

<p>I would respectfully advise the
Department that for the expense
of moving archives and for their
proper presentation, a further allowance
is necessary.</p>

<p>To make this purchase I have used
money intended for my family in New York,
and hoping that my action will meet
with approval. I have drawn upon

November 14th 1887.</p>

<p>Hon. James D. Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to forward
to the Department the following:</p>

<p>Some years ago American
vessels had no difficulty in securing a
cargo of the products of this province. A trade
was growing between the United States and
Angola gathering every day more and more
in importance, but unfortunately for its
continuance, our troubles at home caused
its abandonment and, since then, it has
never been resumed.</p>

<p>The periodical arrival of
steamers and sailing vessels from Europe.
The building of railways and water works
by European capital, shows what value this 
province has in the eyes of commercial
<catchwords>Europe.</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80027"/>

Europe.</p>

<p>There are five lines of steamers
running from European ports to Loanda, two
from England, two from Portugal and one 
from Germany.</p>

<p>The Portuguese steamers are
subsidized. Leaving Lisbon on the 6th of 
every month, calling at Madeira, St. Vincent, Banana, 
Princess Island, Ambriz, Loanda, and
as far south as Mossamedes, taking about seventy
days to make the round voyage.</p>

<p>The English steamers leave
Liverpool about every thrice weeks, taking about
three months to make the round trip.</p>

<p>The German steamers are
irregular, seldom going south of Loanda.</p>

<p>Besides the above, the
Dutch Trading Company have a steamer
making about five round trips a year.</p>

<p>The arrival of sailing
vessels from England, Portugal, Germany,
France, and Holland, are frequent, from the
United States and about every eighteen months.</p>

<p>The principal imports
from each country are, cotton grade
<catchwords>woollen</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80028"/>

woollen goods, hardware, crockery, machinery,
cutlery, powder, guns, provisions &amp;c, from
England; spirits, beer, guns, powder, hardware 
&amp;c, from Germany, flour, petroleum,
soap from America; wines, silks &amp;c. from
France. Most of these goods are sent
to Loanda via Lisbon, re-exported from
Portugal in Portuguese vessels, there is a 
reduction in the import duties of 30%.</p>

<p>The exports are bees' wax, coffee,
cotton, cattle, hides, dried fish, gums, ivory,
india rubber, oils, orchella weed, palm
kernals sesame seed, tobacco and fibre.</p>

<p>Coffee is sent to Portugal.
Holland and Germany, cotton to England-
Portugal and Holland, hides to Portugal,
ivory, rubber, archilla weed oils, palm
kernals, sesame seed, and tobacco to England
and Portugal, cattle and dried fish to
French and Portuguese dependencies.</p>

<p>The export duties is 3% on
shipments in <sic>Portugese</sic> vessels and 5% in 
foreign vessels. The differential duties does
not so much effect the manufacturing 
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80029"/>

as the shipping industries.</p>

<p>The promise of Angola is one of
the most important on the African Coast. It
is rich in minerals and its soil is exceptionally
fertile.</p>

<p>Agriculture is in a progressive
condition. Large plantations of coffee, and
sugar cane, owned by Europeans as well
as smaller ones, cultivated by the natives, line
the many rivers that irrigate the country.</p>

<p>Whether the United States would 
be benefited by taking part in the trade of
this coast, is worthy of consideration. There
are few, if any, articles imported into the
province, which we do not produce as
cheap, if not cheaper, than any country
with whom we would have to compete, nor
would we be more embarrassed by the
laws which regulate the collection of duties
than the most favored nation.</p>

<p>The city of Loanda contains
about fifteen thousand inhabitants, one
thousand of these are white, mostly convicts,
carpentering, brick laying, shoemaking,
tailoring, grogshop keeping on the
<catchwords>common</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80030"/>

common, avocations.</p>

<p>The city is divided into a 
lower, and, an upper town. The upper
town is built upon a hill surrounding one
side of the lower town which nestles at its
base, along the shore, and it, with the harbor
formed by the beautiful bay, are over
shadowed by the walls of Fort St Miguel
which perched upon a bola precipice at
the waters edge, protects the port.</p>

<p>Many large and important
public buildings are in efficient working
order; a creditable public market building 
is busily occupied during the day
by buyers and sellers; a custom house,
situated near the water-side and opposite 
to a large structure belonging to
the Department of Public Works, offers
every convenience for the rapid transaction 
of business. There are a number
of churches, but they are sparsely attended 
except on special occasions. a large
hospital capable of accommodating
eight hundred patients and having
a full staff of efficient officers and
<catchwords>nurses</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80031"/>

nurses, is most happily located upon the hill.</p>

<p>The climate is unhealthy, many
deaths are caused by small-pox, a disease
common at the change of season. It is
impossible to learn how many die as the
records are very unreliable.</p>

<p>The streets of the lower city
are, as a rule, wide, but the sand
settling into them from the higher land,
has formed a deposit several inches in
depth of loose earth very hard to walk in.
There are several well paved roads running
from the lower to the upper city, where
are the Governor's palace, the prison, the
barracks, the treasury, and other public 
offices, also an observatory where observation
of temperature, height of barometer, &amp;c., are
taken daily. The upper city, from being
exposed fully to the sea breeze, is the
healthiest part of the town.</p>

<p>There, are two newspapers
published, on weekly, one semi-weekly,
one is, an official bulletin and the
other is devoted to general news.</p>

<p>There is a fair military
<catchwords>band</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80032"/>

band which plays in a public garden
treated in the upper town, three times
a week, with the exception of this
there, are no public announcements.</p>

<p>Loanda is in telegraphic commu=
nication with Europe as well as with a 
number places in the interior. Telephone
in the city are in constant use.</p>

<p>The Banco Nacional Ultramarino
of Lisbon have a branch here as well as
others, at Mossamedes, and Benguella. It is
largely interested in the sugar and coffee
growing industries, holding mortgages on
many plantations, an account of money
advanced to work the same.</p>

<p>Quite a large business is done
by the bank in the sale of its paper, as
a large general <unclear extent="one word"/> business is done here
and in the up country for a currency having
only a local value and with which bank
paper is bought for use abroad.</p>

<p>Stores here with a stock of 
general merchandize, are numerous and
all of them seem to be doing a fair 
business.</p> 

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80033"/>

The cost of living in Loanda
is high, or dear, the cheapest accommodation
costing 2 Rs 500 i.e. $3.70/100 per diem.</p>

<p>Although large sales are made
in the city, yet Loanda is but a depot
for the supply of factories established in
the interior, at least eighty per cent of the
exports are perchased by factors employed 
by the merchants in the city.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Quanza
are the trading stations of Calumbo, Bruto,
Maximo, Massanga, Cambambe, Dondo, and
others. All of these are centres of trade for
many miles around them, and are visited
twice a week by steamers plying between
them and Loanda, as well as by an
overland mail every few days.</p>

<p>The output of the Quanza
District is very large, and taxes severely
the carrying capacity of the present
means of transportation, yet it is nothing
in comparison to what it will be in
the near future, where the rail road becomes 
a factor in opening the interior.
Running for hundreds of mile through
<catchwords>an</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80034"/>

an exceedingly rich, and fertile country, it
will cause many new industries to spring 
to life, not the least of which will be
the gathering of woods valuable for their
application to dye and furniture making.
New impetus will be given to the agricultural
industries, for whereas now <unclear>inter-</unclear>transportation 
is both expensive and difficult,
then the plantations being rapidly and
cheaply emptied of their products will
encourage the planters and farmers to 
exert themselves for larger profits.</p>

<p>The work of laying pipes
for the purpose of bringing the water of
the Bengo into Loanda is most satisfactorly
progressing and it is expected will be 
finished by next August.</p>

<p>During the year which ended
on the 30th of June 1887, 3288 <sic>passenser</sic>
arrived in Loanda, and 2828 sailed from
the same place; of 122 vessels entered 54
were Portuguese Steamers, and 40 were foreign, also
22 Portuguese sailing vessels, and 6 foreign; those
that sailed were 57 Portuguese Steamers and
40 Foreign; 25 Portuguese sailing vessels and
<catchwords>6</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80035"/>

foreign. Total tonnage of those entered 95,755
Tons; those sailed 98,734 Tons Value of Imports
was $1,034,988.50/100; the value of Exports was
$773,663.00/100.</p>

Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to call the
attention of the Department to the fact that
that this Consular District extends from
Ambriz in 7Â° 49' S. Lat., to Cape Frio 18Â°
20' S. Lat, and from 13Â° E. Long. to 18Â° E Long.</p>

<p>By referring to dispatch No.
13., having same date as this, it will be
seen that the commercial nations of Europe
consider that this country is worthy of attention.
Confident of its future they are investing 
large sums in opening the interior in
internal improvements, and in the cultivation
of its trade.</p>

<p>Whether it would be advantageous 
to the United States for it to become
actively interested in this trade is a 
<catchwords>question</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90002"/>

to be decided by its merchants, but before
they, can so, decide it is necessary that
they should be thoroughly advised as to
the nature of the trade and the many
causes affecting it, for now to them it is,
in a commercial sense, almost an unknown
land.</p>

<p>The object of the Government in 
sustaining a Consulate here is, I judge, to
advance the commercial interests of its country.
That this can be done under the present arrangement 
of things, it seems to me, is doubtful
unless information is given which will influence
commercial action the problems, as
to whether this trade should be cultivated by
our merchants, will long remain unsolved.</p>

<p>A residence of many years in
Africa has taught me that, to speak advisedly
and correctly of its trade, it is not well
to confide in the statements of merchants
and traders who desirous of presenting opposition,
have no hesitation in using as a means
to that end, falsehood, but it is necessary that
that knowledge should be gained which is to 
be had only by personal examination.</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90003"/>

The difference in the habits, customs
and language of the natives of districts <sic>seperated</sic>
from one another by only a few miles, while
great, are not more pronounced than those which
are to be found in the lower animal life, the
flora, the <sic>vegatation</sic> and the physical conformation 
of the country for instance, the
natives of one district superstitiously refuse to
gather certain products, yet the tribe adjoining
them use the same product as their principal
article of trade, that one class of <sic>vegatation</sic> is
not common to the country is evidenced by
the fact that in certain districts nothing grows
but that giant of the forest, the "Baobab,"
from which is taken a fibre known to commerce
as "Andasonia."</p>

<p>I hope that the Department will
concur with me in thinking that this Consulate
would be useful if it should become actively
engaged in collecting such information as
would enable the Department to consider with
the merchants of our country, those questions which
would determine the value of this trade with the
United States.</p>

<p>This cannot be done by a quiet resi-
<catchwords>dence</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90004"/>

dence in Loanda, for the
people, the customs of the natives,
the <sic>vegatation</sic> and the trade
should be made a study at
their homes and at the places 
of supply.</p>

<p>I am aware of the great
amount of labor contained in
in the undertaking of this work,
as well as I am of the danger
which environs it because of
exposure and hostile natives,
but being to an extent familiar
with the general characteristics
of these people, and being more
or less inured to the unhealthy
climate, I have no hesitation in
saying that I feel that I am
fitted to enter into this work with
confidence in my capacity to
bring it to a successful conclusion; 
therefore, I have the
honor to respectfully request
that the Department will
issue such instructions, and 
<catchwords>make</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90005"/>

make such an allowance as will enable
me to proceed with this endeavor.</p>

<p>In seeking this employment
I am influenced by the hope of being
able to make such a report as will
be of value in the eyes of our citizens
interested in commerce, and of
earning for myself the commendation 
of the Department.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
Henry F. Downing<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<pb facs="Scan90006"/>

<p>For<lb/>
Mr. Reves:</p>

<p>Angola is a Portuguese colony and its trade
is monopolized as far as can be by tariffs and discriminating 
duties, by Portugal. North of it lies the Bongo region,
just now being worked by various European governments. 
This suggests to me several <sic>reason</sic> why it
would be like "shearing a hog" to attempt to open up any
trade in that region:</p>

<p>1. The differential duties of Portugal forbid competition</p>

<p>2. The greater distance from Loando to the U.S. places
our shippers at a disadvantage</p>

<p>3. It is impossible to make way against the <unclear>trust</unclear> 
(natural or <unclear extent="one word"/>) of the Germans, who
are seeking to found colonies in that part.</p>

<p>4. Our trade with Angola is nil and I believe consists 
only in some <unclear>rum</unclear>, perhaps a survival
of the slave traffic.</p>

<p>5. No description of the physical character of the
country, or of the productions &amp;c. could be of service 
against such odds. What products we
need are easily procured indirectly through
England, Germany, &amp; Portugal.</p>

<p>6. The entire trade, export and import, of Angola
does not exceed $3,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>Respectfully<lb/>
Worthington C. Ford.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the
Department that the continued indisposition
under which I labored during the time
occupied in making transit to my post, after
my arrival at Loanda culminated in an aggravated
case of inflammation of the bladder
and in kidney troubles.</p>

<p>Because of being dependent upon
my salary for the support of my family and
myself, I have been compelled to deprive myself
of that clerical assistance which my
condition demanded, and in despite of much 
suffering from pain and weakness from loss of
blood I have persisted in the endeavor to perform
the duties of my office.</p>

<p>This condition has unfortunately

doubt as to the numbering of my despatches
and would respectfully ask the Department
to furnish me with memorandum of title
and number of despatches received from 
this Consulate since the 1st Ultimo; so that
I may be able to correct errors to date.</p>

<p>I am glad that I am able to
report that my condition is improving, and
have reason to believe that a month or two

<p>Hon James D. Porter<lb/>

Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose here
with copy of a communication from Mr. Jos.
Clark of the A. B. Missy. Unions at Palabala
Station in the Congo Free State.</p>

<p>This matter has already been brought
under the notice of the Department through
desatch No. 33 under date of Sept 30 1887 and
copy of petition enclosed therein.</p>

<p>By referring to Consular Instructions,
Par. 26 Page 10. I find that by the limitation
of jurisdiction this Consulate is presented,
unless under special instructions from the Department, 
from taking such action as would relieve
these United States citizens from the <unclear extent="one word"/> of which
they complain.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that any 
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90012"/>

of the citizens of our great country should
find theirselves the objects of injustice and
wrong, but her much more room there is
for regret when it is remembered that these
people are not only americans but are exponents 
of principles which should influence
all christendom to aid and protect them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on this coast right
unsupported by power is weak; <sic>indivuals</sic>
and associations thrive or suffer according
to the positions taken by their Governments
in securing to them their rights.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of experience African
residents that for the protection of the citizens
of the United States who are now, or may
become, inhabitants of the Congo Free State,
an agent from our Government should visit
this state at least once a year, and that 
the adoption of such a course would create
a moral influence sufficient to protect
the interests of our citizens.</p>

<p>In view of the Department
deciding to act upon the suggestion contained
in these opinions as quoted by me, I
would respectfully call the attention of
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90013"/>

the Department to the fast that the geographical 
position and the lightness of its duties,
places this Consulate in a situation to commically 
and satisfactorily perform any work
the Department may see fit to instruct it to
enter into in the Congo Free State.</p>

<p>Hon. George L. Reves,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose
herewith copies and translations of letters
received at this Consulate from the
undermentioned commercial houses 
of this city, Viz: Messrs Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co,
Messrs Baines Larsen &amp; Co.,
Messrs <unclear>Palhares</unclear> and <unclear>Frenares</unclear>
Messrs Souza Lara &amp; Co., and
Messrs <unclear>Sevart</unclear> &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Referring to enclosure No 1,
"Messrs Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co." it seems to me
as being worthy of study, in so far that,
although it bears the signature of the
firm above mentioned, it is an emanation 
of the individual. Mr Newton, who
is a Vice Consul of the United States,
<catchwords>But</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90016"/>

but I fancy to do it justice, it should
be read as coming from a Consular
Office of the British Government, and
an English merchant jealous of opposition.</p>

<p>It appears singular that after the
many years Mr Newton has acted as
U.S. Consul here, that the first merchants
in the place can say "that American
goods are not used because they are
not known," considering this, the fact
that he can see "no inducements for
American merchants &amp;c," many find explanation 
in his method of performing
the duties of U.S. Consul is far as they
relate to the <unclear>extention</unclear> of our foreign
trade.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the inclosure
above referred to, in its  treatment of
the subject under consideration either
does not graph its importance or is
influenced by a desire to discourage
new departures. It seems strange who,
that a successful merchant with
large experience in referring to

<pb facs="Scan90017"/>

causes affecting the commercial growth of a 
nation, should allow his thoughts to be
confined to a question of three or four
years, or that he should limit himself
to the consideration of one product when
commenting upon the resources of a country
so rich in natural agricultural and
manufactured products as ours.</p>

<p>Enclosure No 2: Messrs Baines Larsen &amp; Co.
interested in the growth of commercial relation 
between this province and the U.S. 
adopt a tome that carries with it the
impression of honest expression and considerable 
study. I am unfortunately because
of limited experience, unable to judge
correctly as to the value of their suggestions 
relative to the method to be
adopted to enable American Capital
to get a firm foothold in the part
of Africa, but, as far as knowledge
of the West Coast gives me a right to
judge of here. I think they are in 
some respects, right.</p>

<p>It is worthy of attention
that this firm in referring to cottons
<catchwords>would</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90018"/>

strengthen their statements by forwarding sample
showing that if the U.S. desires to place
cotton on this market, it will be necessary
for her manufactures to enter into a competition 
of inferiority, but an examination 
of those used in the Northern districts
shows an improvement in quality such as
"our honesty," allows us to manufacture.
These samples with samples of corals
mentioned by this firm, I have forwarded 
to the Department.</p>

<p>Inclosure No. 3. Messrs <unclear>Palhaves</unclear> &amp; <unclear>Frenares</unclear>,
in contradiction to Messrs Newton, Carneqie 
&amp; Co. though acquainted with only one 
of the products of our country, believe
that the introduction of American
commodities is to be desired.</p>

<p>Enclosure No. 4. Messrs Sousa Lara
and Co., have an experience limited
to yellow &amp; pitch pine.</p>

<p>Inclosure No. 5. Messrs Sevart &amp; Co,
refer to England and Germany as the
countries of supply for this trade, ignorant of our capacity, they seem to think
that our products are only such as
would

<pb facs="Scan90019"/>

would appeal to the requirements
of the European population, get they
believe, "American goods, may be introduced 
with advantage on this market."</p>

<p>Their letters are from of the
first commercial people of Loanda the
longest shippers and importers. It will
be recognized that, with one exception
they are remarkably unanimous in looking
at things in a narrow way, a comprehensive 
view of the possibilities of the country
seems to beyond their ability or desire
and to any influence beyond those 
which affect small and immediate
pecuniary returns, they are dead.</p>

<p>The great nations of Europe 
find here, and in adjoining districts
valuable outlets for their industries. 
Taught by experience the value of representation, 
there is not a spot of commercial 
value on the coast where
English or German houses have not
planted their need. The factors with
which these countries have excused
these gratifying results, should not 
<catchwords>be</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90020"/>

be particular to them, but ought to be
common to all alike. Commercial enterprise 
environed by good judgment, is their
<unclear>scent</unclear>. American industries can find their
way into and secure a safe place in these
centres, if Americans will adopt the
methods as practiced by the English and
Germans. Resident representation coming
for contact with the native, leaning his
needs and securing an intimate knowledge 
of the trade. a supply of merchandise,
steady in its flow and independent of
good and bad seasons alike, direct
communication, cheap and rapid. Given
these qualities, it would be seen that
in a few years our increasing industries
would find outlets in many parts of
the world where now the reports of
our country's industries and greatness 
are look upon as almost a romance.</p>

<p>To open the eyes of these people
to the value of our goods it is necessary
that some method be adopted to bring
them under their notice. This might
be done by the establishment here,

<pb facs="Scan90021"/>

under the supervision of this Consulate,
of a Sample Room, where could be
displayed, at a nominal cost, full
lines of our commodities. This Enterprise,
preparing a way for future and increasing 
movements, would receive
valuable assistance from Messrs Baines,
Lauer &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Henry F. Downing, Esq<lb/>
United States Consul,<lb/>
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In answer to your letter of the 1st
inst., we beg to reply as follows.</p>

<p>We see no inducement for
American merchants to invest in the Angola
trade as there are too many houses already for
the trade and they would have every <unclear>thing</unclear>
against them. They would have no direct communication
and unless their good were shipped through
Lisbon they would have to pay the import duty which
is a difference of 30%.</p>

<p>We do nothing with American
goods, although a few years ago we used to have this
cargo a year. There is however a considerable quantity
of pitch pine timber imported and this year three
cargoes have come from Pensacola, but now the port
is supplied for some time to come. We have given
up the trade ourselves as we found the profit
to be too small to be worth the time and
trouble.</p>

<p>When the Railway is finished
we have not the slightest doubt but that
trade will greatly increase but that will take

<pb facs="Scan90023"/>

three or four years at least. The American
import which is timber, will, we think instead
of increasing be <unclear extent="one word"/> as good wood is to
be <unclear extent="one word"/> in the interior.</p>

<p>We have really no statistics before
us to offer you but we shall always be happy
at any time, in assisting you to get any information 
you may wish for.</p>

<p>Henry F. Downing Esq.<lb/>
U.S. Consul,<lb/>
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In reply to your official letter asking
us for information relative to local outlets
for American products we have the honor
to inform you that we have made a special
study of this question, and have for the
last year exerted ourselves to open up correspondence 
on the subject.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have consulted other
firms in our city and have become familiar
with the local idea that American 
products are limited to Lumber and
Petroleum.</p>

<p>We take it that you wish to have
a plain statement on our side of what
can be done and how to do it. The
matter is however a very complex one
and must be treated at length, for
our ground extends not only to this neighborhood
but to the North Coast and the
Congo River.</p>

<pb facs="Scan90026"/>

<p>Angola. Loanda.</p>

<p>Here very little has come in beyond Petroleum, lumber
and occasional lots of flour and soap.</p>

<p>Petroleum. The consumption in Loanda = about 30 cases
of 10 ga. each, per diem = 900 cases per month.
Novo Redondo, Benguela, Mossamedes, S. <unclear>Hume</unclear>
and Banana = probably 2500 cases per month.
Donds and the other River and interior towns
another 1600 = 5000 cases of 10 gals. ea. per
month for this province. To secure a monopoly
of this trade it would be necessary to crush
competition, and to do this the stuff would
have to be put <unclear>cif</unclear> in most of the ports mentioned 
@ Reis <unclear extent="one word"/> 1$250. In Banana and
Cabinda better prices <unclear>rule</unclear>. In Cabinda in
contrast with the Government is for Reis 1$960
per case. Custom duties in all entrese ports except
Banana and Cabinda, which are free = 20
Reis per kilo.</p>

<p>Lumber. There are now five Loanda forms selling lumber
and we are awaiting a consignment from Norway.
Occasional lots, say 400 tons, would sell in 
about 3 months @ an average of Reis 25$000
per 1000 ft. run. If you wish we will give
you pro forma a/c sales. The duty is 15% a.d. <unclear extent="one word"/>
kind of lumber 5" sq yellow pine logs, match
boarding 1" &amp; 1/2" and scan things. Shingles
might do well north but have no sale in

<pb facs="Scan90027"/>

Loanda.</p>

<p>The one thing necessary for Angola trade
is to put "something called soap" - hard, and
dark in color - on this market at a maximum
of Reis 3$000 per 50 kilo <unclear>cif</unclear> Loanda. 
Consumption about 200 cases per month.</p>

<p>Flour. Fair quality such as that offered @ $3.50
to $4.00 in America should be put here <unclear>cif</unclear>
at $6.50 to $7.00. It sells well at about $8.00
in the Custom house. The consumption in
Loanda and interior towns average 500 
barrels monthly. By taking in the <unclear extent="one or two words"/>
Angola, and the Congo ports the quantity
might be trebled.</p>

<p>Butter. Not good business in Loanda where
Normandy butter is preferred. It however
sells well North, selling price 450 reis per
lb: duty 20%.</p>

<p>Hams. In small lots have regular sales through
out. same prices and duties as butter.</p>

<p>Paints &amp; Oils. Are of importance in view of the various
Government contracts. Red lead (powder), in
kegs should arrive <unclear>cif</unclear> @ 161 to 171- per 50
kilos as a maximum others in proportion
Terpentine and Raw Linseed oil at 5d
and 6d kilo.</p>

<p>Furniture. In carefully assorted lots, cheap and
showy stuff (best taken to pieces and put


<pb facs="Scan90028"/>

up here), such as carpet seated and fancy 
chairs, wardrobes and chiffoniers, writing
tables (plain with two to four drawers), stools,
folding hatracks, commode, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. sell well
if cheap. Take for instance as a basis a
"showy" 5 ft. wardrobe @ from $35.00 to $40.00, 
(without mirror).</p>

<p>Soft Goods. Table cloths and napkins; handkerchiefs; &amp;c,
have regular sales at low prices. Duties linen
780 reis per kilo, cotton 500 reis.</p>

<p>Tea. Of fair quality (black and green) sells @
800 to 900 reis per lb. Duty 240 reis per $.</p>

<p>Cheese. Regular sales in small lots, selling @
400 to 450 Reis lb. duty 25%.</p>

<p>Canned Goods. American canned goods are not known.
Canned Beef put up by the "Armour Co" is
however much favored @ 500 reis per 2 lb
tin.</p>

<p>Lard. Good business in regular lots sells @ 220
reis per lb. Duty 20%.</p>

<p>Matches. Cannot compete with the Germans.</p>

<p>Cod fish If every dry has large sale. It would
be advisable to experiment with Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Cotton Goods. So far as this province (apart from
the District of the Congo) is connected there
is one great obstacle in the way of American
products, and that is American honesty.
Our cottons (equalling in value 50 Rs 500:00

<pb facs="Scan90029"/>

monthly), are made up with starch and clay 
and generally falsified, a fair price for a fair
article cannot be obtained. We well give you 
samples.</p>

<p>Guns. Flintlock guns (called Lazzarina) (ball 3/4 ball
&amp; 1/2 ball), are supplied by England and Germany
at 5/- each. These sell here in the Custom house
@ about 5/9.</p>

<p>Demijohns. Of 5 gals. wicker corned sell @ 600 to 700 reis. Duty
25%. Sales from 500 to 1000 per month. They are
usually sent filled with rice.</p>

<p>Rice. Rangoon sells @ 1000 reis per 15 kilos. Duty
15 reis per kilo. Large consumption.</p>

<p>Sugar. Sells well in regular lots @ reis 2,200 per 15 kilos
for <unclear>lump</unclear> <unclear>chystallized</unclear> and reis 1,900 per 15 kilo for
Brown Sugar. Duties refined 40 reis kilo. unrefined
20 reis kilo.</p>

<p>Tobacco. Prohibition duties = 3$200 reis per kilo.</p>

<p>Clocks. American alarm clocks and the very cheapest
watches. good sale for small lots.</p>

<p><unclear>Candles</unclear> Are invoiced to us at 35 from as per 100 kilos</p>

<p>Cast of Army Uniforms. sell largely in the interior but
should not be invoiced at more than 400 to 500
reis per garment.</p>

<p>Barrel &amp; Pipe Staves. Sell well</p>

<p>Small Articles. We are now about to experiment with these in
great variety, and it will be better to advise
you later on.</p>

<pb facs="Scan90030"/>

<p>Rum. 40Â° clear. Should be put here <unclear>cif</unclear> at Rs 28,000
per 130 gals. safe shipments including northern
parts about 50 pipes.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks will serve to give you some
idea of the prospects offered in this province proper. In
view of the future, however, we have to consider the probable
commercial changes resultant upon the completion of the
Loanda and Ambaca Railway.</p>

<p>The Railway <unclear>Service</unclear>,
was originally formulated with the idea of opening
up the <unclear>Lineage</unclear> gold fields to the North of Galingo Alto.
Its value, however does not depend upon any speculative
enterprise but upon the natural resources of the province.
The fertile districts of Cazengo, Galingo Alto. Encoge &amp;c.,
producing coffee, rubber, palm oil, kernals &amp;c. in great
abundance are practically robbed of their value by
the difficulties of transport.</p>

<p>At times carriers are not to be had to
the river ports, but were <unclear extent="one word"/> no difficulty in this repeat
the excessive rates of the Companhia da Vapor de Quanza 
would be sufficient to heavily handicap any enterprise.</p>

<p>We will give you the figures, premising that
the produce is practically unlimited; given proper
merchandise and rapid transport the trade of
Angola would assume an importance it has never
yet possessed. From Encoge to Donda, 5 days journey
Each carrier will take kilos of coffee, price per
carrier per trip 4$000 ries. Therefore each ton of

<pb facs="Scan90031"/>

coffee requires 14 1/2 carriers and exists from Encoge 
to Donda 58$ 000 Reis From Donda to Loanda
by the Quanza River Steamers the freight is 40
ries per ton per kilametre. Donda is 200 kilametres
from Loanda, Ex. 200 x40 = 5000 Reis x 58 Rs 100 = 66$
about $70.00 per ton over 124 miles. The natural
consequence is that the interior plantations are
continually losing money and are all <unclear>hypothecated</unclear>
to the Bank. Here again we have the
secret of the falsified goods. Now all this
the Railway will remedy by tapping the Cazengo,
Galungo and Encoge districts, enabling us to
mend our goods up cheaply and rapidly and get
our produce down <unclear extent="one word"/> equally advantageous
circumstances.</p>

<p>The Railway will be built and will pay
well. It is however, at present in dubious hands.
If things go wrong it may be five years before
the times <unclear extent="two words"/>: if not three years will
enable it to at least mitigate the evils we have
mentioned.</p>

<p><unclear extent="two words"/> the line will be built because
if the company fails in its obligation a Syndicate
of African merchants is prepared to come forward
and push the thing through.</p>

<p>District of the Congo</p>

<p>We would rather not go into detail as to the River
Congo itself as we are of opinion that any statement

<pb facs="Scan90032"/>

would fall short of the reality. We have,
however, powerful friends there, and if we could
go on a comprehensive visit together much might
be arranged.</p>

<p>Outside of the Congo itself but within its
district we have outlets at Landana, Cabinda
and Ambrizette, not to mention S. Antonio on the
Congo. These places are supply under Government
Contracts with all kinds of provisions &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In this district trade is essentially different
to that of Angola proper, goods are only partially 
<unclear>adultuated</unclear> and falsified and there is yet
a good field for American Cottons of the lowest
quality. In Cabinda alone we can guarantee
150 tons of produce per month and with a few
more houses in the Chiloango river we have no doubt
that it could be quadrupled. As merchants we 
could sell you about 100 tons per month. <unclear extent="one word"/>
@ 400 reis per 32$, not to mention splendid hand
woods in any quantity.</p>

<p>Such produce is all bought in barter for:</p>

<p>1Â° Cotton as per samples, pieces 40" under x 24 <unclear>yds</unclear> &amp; 24 <unclear>folded</unclear>
Handkerchiefs in price of one dozen. Best sales, blue
boxes, checks, <unclear>Hdkfs</unclear> and red <unclear extent="one word"/>.</p>

<p>2Â° White and yellow metal anklets weighing 1 to 2
$ 1/2" plain.</p>

<p>3Â° Cheap Bells of different sign refer to 6"</p>

<p>4Â° Rum 40Â°.</p>

<pb facs="Scan90033"/>

<p>5Â° Red Corals as per samples. To resist heat and
hot water.</p>

<p>6Â° Keg powder. 2x4 <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<p>Here also can be sold regular lots of flour, <unclear extent="one word"/>
wine, shot, and sundry other article which we will
advise later. Products are kernals, palm oil,
Rubber and ground nuts. We think also that
a little pushing might arrange for a fair
quantity of ivory.</p>

<p>Estimated capital for this enterprise
as far as concerns establishing and stocking
ten (10) factories = $60,000.00. No American
labor required nor timber construction.</p>

<p>In conclusion we are of opinion that for 
American to be advantageously represented in
Africa it is necessary that:</p>

<p>1Â° A company be formed in American with at least
$200,000.00 Capital.</p>

<p>2Â° That an energetic and pushing firm be
appointed a African Manager with a "good
interest" acting under supervision.</p>

<p>3Â° That the company own at least 4 sailing
vessels of from 350 to 400 tons burden and
that these seem regularly between the two
countries: paving the way for steam
communication.</p>

<p>Given the conditions it is easy for
American products to obtain a form footing

<pb facs="Scan90034"/>

in African and for America to assume that
position as regards Africa which as one of the
most important nations of the world she has
only exert himself to command.</p>

<p>We would also call your attention to the
fact that there are some hundreds of <unclear extent="one word"/> registered 
in the Secretarial of this town: including
gold, coal, petroleum, copper, and other valuable
minerals. In Cabinda we have copper, lead
and iron in great profusion, and were informed
by the Government some time since that there exists
every indication of coal.</p>

<p>We do not ask you to accept our views without
question, but are quite ready to put you in possession
of the means of informing yourself as to the value
of our remarks.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>We beg to acknowledge your letter
of the 2d Ulto. in reply;</p>

<p>We are of opinion that the
introduction of American goods on this market
would exert a beneficial influence on local <unclear extent="one word"/>
first by provoking competition and secondly by
placing on our lists a number of articles that
are not used because they are not known.</p>

<p>2. Petroleum is the only American
product we deal in. We are supplied by Lisbon
Germany, England and France.</p>

<p>3. It in probable that the Loanda
and Ambaca R'y and other schemes now being
exploited in Angola will in the immediate
future increase the volume of trade and open
up many other outlets for business.</p>

<p>We have the honor to acknowledge

in respect to the prospects to be obtained for
American goods in this market.</p>

<p>In reply we beg to inform you

lumber (yellow and pitch pine), as filling the
necessary conditions.</p>

<p>Henry F. Downing, Esq<lb/>
U.S. Consul,<lb/>
Lonada.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>We beg to acknowledge your favor
of the 4th inst., and have much pleasure in replying
to your various question.</p>

<p>The commerce of the United States,
altho' of great importance in <unclear>itself</unclear>, has only
manifested itself on a very small scale in our
possession of Angola, seeing principally to the
limited market we have for any article not <unclear extent="one word"/>
proper for the native trade.</p>

<p>This branch of manufacture
has been held by England from the outset and
include such articles as raw and striped cotton
fabrics, crocking, guns (flintlock), and powder.
We are not aware as to whether America can
compete in this line: the one <unclear>known</unclear> fact being
that the English and German market are
drawn upon exclusively.</p>

<p>As to other goods for the <unclear extent="one word"/>
of the European population their importance
is relatively insignificant. We may however
remark:</p>

<p>1Â° We believe that American goods
may be introduced with advantage on our
market.</p>

<p>2Â° The principal articles which
have been handled by us in dealing with
America, have been pitch pine, petroleum,
<catchwords>soap</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan990003"/>

<unclear>soap</unclear> and furniture</p>

<p>Of these we have received consignments from 
Wilmington. It is however necessary to note that
petroleum and soap shipped direct cannot
compete in price with the same articles via Europe.
Petroleum in direct lots costs about double the
price of European shipments.</p>

<p>3Â° We have every hope that the commerce
of Angola will sooner or later improve in tone
oeing principally to the Loanda &amp; Ambaca
R'y Scheme.</p>

<p>4Â° As we have already observed our relations
with the United States have been limited and
it has only been in timber that any real
business ha been done.</p>

<p>We remain<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Yours respectfully,<lb/>

<p>Commercial relations between

worthy of a cultivation not to be had

of information.</p>

<p>The incumbency of the office of
Consul or Vice Consul carries with it
certain duties that, to be properly performed,
should be in the hands of some one
<catchwords>interested</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan990008"/>

interested in American Commerce.</p>

<p>I enclose herewith Instrument
executed in accordance with "Consular Regulation."
for the action of the Department.</p>

is an English subject and a man of capacity.
He refers to Messrs <unclear>Mosbachev</unclear> &amp; Co. 105 Water
