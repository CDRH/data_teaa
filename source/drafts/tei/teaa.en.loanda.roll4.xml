Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to state that
Despatch No 12 is received and contents
carefully noted, for which I thank the 
Department.</p>

<p>I have been following a real slave
business going on here and carried
out by Portuguese from Lisbon and 
both whites and mulattos of this 
country. I wanted and still
intend to follow them on that business
up to the near interior where the 
purchase is effected by Barter, &amp;c &amp;c
as is the case, I am told, throughout
almost all the trading posts, not
only of the interior but near the seaboard 
and rivers: Such is the case
at the most important town of
Dande on the Quanza river: Ambriz
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan10039"/>

and specially at the southern
ports of Benguella and Catumbella
where large caravans of two and
three thousand negroes are constantly
arriving from the interior, bringing
along with their produce numbers
of young blacks for sale or barter; 
they average in ages from infancy 
to full grown adults, and always
find a ready market with brisk
competition.</p>

<p>From the small seaport of Novo-Redondo
South of Loanda, an export
trade has been regularly carried
on for more than five years by
the agents and on account of the 
Bank Alltramarine of Lisbon. The
agent form this port is a Mr
Patricio Alvares, and although certain 
forms are carried out as prescribed 
by their emigration laws,
it is well known that as soon
as they are landed at St Thomas,
and that by the hundreds. they
are treated, conducted and consi-
<catchwords>dered</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan10040"/>

dered as slaves; and not one
has ever been known to have returned, 
and most probably never
will be.</p>

<p>But I have been now for a 
long time very sick, and this
month hardly able to write, even
my wife Mrs Du Verge has left
for the United States via Liverpool:
she has with her a live specimen
of slave traffic in Africa; a stolen
child given to her by a respectable
white merchant for the simple reason 
that she was too young to be
sold.</p>

<p>To the Commander of the French War Vessel
To anchor in Loango <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having heard from several whitemen, that you
had, or were going to take possession of this country, in the name
of the French Government, and having heard also that the Natives
in that case would out of revenge, attack, plunder, and destroy
the several trading houses in the place, and afterwards take to the
bush, I, undersigned a citizen of the United States of North America
doing business in this pace, and in other points near here, having American
and British properly in charge, find myself obliged to <sic>adress</sic>
you the following considerations</p>

<p>That it is almost certain that as soon as the Natives find
out that you are taken possession of their country, they will out of
revenge, attack factories, and plunder and destroy everything, thus
entailing ruin on innocent traders, who have nothing whatever to do
with these questions.</p>

<p>That the presence of your vessel will not deter them from 
so doing, as they will very likely make a right attack, and by <unclear>making</unclear>
it general preclude the possibility of the white men helping each 
other.</p>

<p>That as soon as they have plundered and destroyed the
Factories, killing very likely also some of the white men, they will
take to the Bush, as the loss of their villages is as nothing to them, making
it impossible to find and punish them.</p>

<p>Considering the Circumstances, the Undersigned
thinks it incumbent to him, as a citizen of the United States

<pb facs="Scan20001"/>

of America, as proprietor and Agent, having American and British
property in charge, to formally protect against you and the
French Government individually and collectively, for any loss or
damage that may accrue to him through any, through any 
Acts caused by yours or by the French Government orders,
including additional expenses and loss of time or any other damage
direct or indirect.</p>

<p>Hoping that you will take due notice
of this my formal protest, (a copy of which will be forwarded
to the American Consuls at Gaboon and Loanda),
and that you will kindly send me an acknowledgement
of his receipt, I remain with the greatest consideration.</p>

<p>United State consulate</p>

<p>St. Paul de Loanda<lb/> 
14 June 1883<lb/>
the Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honour to lay 
before the Department of State the 
following circumstances connected
with the discharge of my duties as 
Vice Consul for the United States at
this port.</p>

<p>Mr. L de R du Verge left
Loanda for the Congo on the 16th
ultimo by the Portuguese mail steamer
for the purpose, it is reported, of
arranging with Mr. Stanley the
details of the duties of a post he has
accepted under the Belgian Expedition
without handing over to me the archives
of the Consulate or acquainting me
as to whether I should be able to 
have access to any documents or
forms which might be required,
although I saw that officer on the
day of his departure.</p>

<p>Had there been no immediate con-
<catchwords>sular</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan20005"/>

<catchwords>con-</catchwords>

sular duties to perform I should have waited
the return of Mr. du Verge for an explanation,
and also for an explanation in a matter
of a personal nature which has recently
come to light.</p>

<p>The facts of the case are these: on
the arrival on the 3rd instant of the
wrecked crew of the American whaler
"Merlin", lost South of Mossamedes,
I called at the house of Mr. T. Mark, 
a Swiss, holding a Dry Goods retailed
shop, where Mr. Du Verge has hired a
room as his residence and office. Mr.
Mark who possesses the Key gave me permission 
to enter but would not permit
me to lake the Ships Register as the
Archives, he said, were left in his charge,
and I am unable to register my correspondence 
in the proper official book which 
appeared to be locked away.</p>

<p>Wishing to take to my office the
Ships Register did not appear to me any
infraction of the Rules, or had Mr. Mark
any official right or authority to interfere
with me, for in the first place the room
offered no facilities, for writing and in the

<pb facs="Scan20006"/>

Second I could not without great
inconvenience to myself obtain the
assistance of my mercantile clerks
to write up the Register.</p>

<p>That Mr. Mark, who does not
possess the highest reputation for
soberness or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the archives 
and <unclear extent="one word"/> my actions over
them, shows a want of official consideration 
by Mr. du Verge, and moreover
contrary to the consular instructions.
Under these circumstances and not possessing 
the Key of the room, no responsibility 
can be attached to me for the
safety of the consular papers but I shall
endeavour to exercise such supervision
over them as is consistent with my
relations with Mr. Mark.</p>

<p>It may be inferred that there
exists a difference between Mr du Verge
and myself but such is not the case,
if his friendly pretensions are to be considered 
as a proof of his sincerity, and I 
am quite at a loss to understand what 
motive he has to pass me over in matters

<pb facs="Scan20007"/>

appertaining to the consulate, with
which I have been connected for a long
period, having been appointed to my
present position since 1868, and for 
may years have been in note charge
of the office, without, I venture to state
giving the Department any cause of 
complaint or in any way fialed to 
discharge the duties faithfully and 
conscientiously.</p>

<p>I may also state that my long 
residence here as merchant, and
holding the post of British Vice
Consul which I presume is not incompatible 
with my position as United 
States Vice Consul, give me a status
that facilitates considerably the settlement
of consular business with the local
authorities with whom I have always 
been on the most friendly and intimate 
relationship.</p>

<p>The information that has been given
me regarding myself personally is that
Mr. Mark has failed to obtain any one
here to sign a bond for him to be Vice
Consul at Loanda from which I infer 
<catchwords>that</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan20008"/>

that Mr. du Verge has applied to the 
Department to have me substituted,
but on what ground I am unable
to say.</p>

<p>In submitting the foregoing
matter for the information of the 
Department, I have the honour to
request that should there be no
reason why I should not continue
to hold the post of Vice Consul, that
Mr. du Verge should be instructed
to consign the archives of the Consulate 
to my charge whenever he
may absent himself, and should
it be deemed expedient, to call 
upon him to explain his reasons for
showing such discourtesy to me and
am not his inferior save in Official
rank.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be<lb/>

Your most obedient servant<lb/>

<note>Department of State Received Aug 2 1883</note>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda, 16th June, 1883</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the Department 
of the loss of the Barque "Merlin"
of New Bedford, owned by Messrs Tucker &amp; Co
&amp; others of that city, on the 22nd May
south of Port Alexander in Lat 1:16 4'
From a statement of the Captain and crew
original of which I enclose, it appears
that she went aground in a dense fog
and owing to a heavy surf at the time
they could not save her, although they
did all in their power.</p>

<p>The Captain also states that on the voyage 
up, on trying his Chronometers, he found
them out about 30 miles; and he loses
everything, as he was part owner and 
was not insured. They left the vessel on
the 23rd taking what they could of
provisions and clothes, and proceeded 
north to Mossamedes, where they arrived
on the 24th May, and were taken charge
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan20010"/>

of, by the Portuguese authorities who
treated them most kindly, and the 
Governor charted a small vessel
to bring them here, where they arrived
on the 3rd of this month.</p>

<p>The Governor promised to send and
look after the vessel, and save anything 
that could possibly be saved,
and pay the expenses incurred, out
of the proceeds, any surplus, to be 
forwarded to the Consulate. Should 
however nothing be saved, the A/C
will be forwarded for payment by
first steamer</p>

<p>When men arrived here I had some
difficulty in arranging quarters for
such a large number, however I hired
a house out of town for part, and got
the officers divided into one or two places,
and the whole expense will not exceed
a dollar a head.</p>

<p>By this steamer the "Portugal" bound
to Lisbon to day I send
6 of the men to St Thiago where they
belong, 13 to Madeira, as they belong

<pb facs="Scan20011"/>

to St. Helena, and it is the nearest 
port where there is any communication
with that Island, and
7 to Lisbon, who wish to go to America
and where there is more likelihood of
there getting a vessel.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have communication with
St Helena, but last there is no likelihood 
of any just now, I thought it best to 
send them by this steamer, as stopping
here on chance, would only add to the 
expense. I have arranged with the Agents
of the Mail steamers, Messrs Garrido Camara &amp; Co 
to allow one third off the usual passage
money, which makes the passages as 
follows:</p>

<pb facs="Scan20012"/>

<p>For these amounts, I have passed Bills on
the Secretary of State at 15 days sight
in favor of Messrs Garrido Camara &amp; Co each
one separately, so as to make it clear to 
the Captain who is a foreigner I have
also instructed him that he is to have
the Bills endorsed by the Consul where
the men are landed, otherwise they will 
not be paid by the Department.</p>

<p>I have also passed a draft for $338.00 cts 
in favor of Mr Fredk A. Silva of Boston
to pay the board and lodging A/C rendered,
voucher No 1 enclosed.</p>

<p>Enclosed I also send certificate of Consul

that the following statement is a

<pb facs="Scan20015"/>

loss of the above vessel on which we
were employed at the time of her
loss. We declare that the Bark
"Merlin" of New Bedford of 246 Tons
went on shore at 1/2 past 12 o'clock
at night on the 22nd of May south of
Port Alexander in Lat: 16 4' it being a 
very thick fog at the time and the
land could not be seen at three ships
lengths from the shore. She struck 
<unclear extent="one word"/> twice and <unclear extent="one word"/>, careened, the
wind at the time being a fresh break
from the S'W. After striking got a
Kedge anchor out and hove it might
have but this would not start her
and still continued to thump and
strike on the sand there being at
the time a heavy surf, the sea
breaking over the ship at times:
took one of the anchors on a raft
out to windward hove right <unclear extent="one word"/>
but could not start her but before
this her pumps were chocked
with sand and the water over
the ground tier of casks and pieces 

<pb facs="Scan20016"/>

of plank and keel were flooding up
but we still continued to work hard
after all our hopes were over.</p>

<p>At 6 a.m. seven feet of water forward
and 8 feet aft she having settled 
four feet in the sand By getting
a large anchor and on the quarter
she had worked head on to the 
shore and at low tide was about
three ships lengths distant.</p>

<p>It was impossible to land at this
point in a boat there being a very
heavy surf on Concluded to leave
as soon as possible as we had done
everything possible to save him for
if she were to break up during the
night it would have been dangerous
to have got clear of her with the
boats. We took what we could of
personal effects and provisions and
left her at 2 p.m. on the 23rd May 
for Little Fish Bay about 60 miles
distant. The vessel when we left 
her had silted 6 feet in the sand.
We arrived at Little Fish Bay on the

<pb facs="Scan20017"/>

24th May at 2 p.m. After arriving 
at Mossomedes (Little Fish Bay)
the Governor told us he would
procure us a vessel to carry us
to Loanda where there was a 
Consul. Left Little Fish Bay on
the 30th May and arrived at Loanda
on June 3rd in the <unclear extent="one word"/> 
chartered by the Governor.</p>

<p>If anything can be saved by the 
Government it is to go towards
the expenses incurred at Little
Fish Bay and any surplus forwarded 
to the Consul, should
however nothing be saved the
account of expenses will be
forwarded to Government.</p>

<p>The Governor and people at
Mossamedes treated us in the
kindest way possible and did
all they could to assist us, and 
make us comfortable until a 
vessel could be had to bring
us to Loanda.</p>

<p>At the time of the loss we calcu-

<p>I have the honor to state that upon the receipt

South by order of my medical advisor, and 
visited Benguella, Catumbella &amp; Equimina Bay.
"Catemebella is the center of commerce of

Balindu and <unclear>Bihe</unclear>, I appointed Mr

Jurisdiction about a month ago, Ambriz
is worst than Loanda, but from Kinsembo

<p>I, the undersigned, Chief of
Board of Health of the province
of Angola, do hereby certify that
Louis de Rathier du Verge Esqr, Consul
of the United States of America at
Loanda, has, since his arrival at
this city, suffered from endemic 
diseases:</p>

<p>The miasmatic poison has manifested 
itself through the intermittent 
fevers in their various forms,
together with <sic>inflamation</sic> of the
intestines and the biliary ducts,
congestion of the liver and spleen,
bilious fevers and slight dysentaries</p>

<p>The medicinal treatment not
having obtained a complete cure,
I advised a voyage to the south 
of the province; but the result
was not very satisfactory.</p>

<p>For this reason, and seeing that
the patient's health is visibly declining, 
from day to day, I am 
of opinion that he should, at once, return

<pb facs="Scan20030"/>

return to America, at the risk of
his life should he remain longer
under the influence of this climate.
The above is my opinion which I will
conferm under oath, if necessary.</p>

<p>Given at the Board of Health of 
the province of Angola at Loanda
on the 12th day of May 1883.</p>

<p>To<lb/>
Hon. John Davis<lb/>
Asst. Secty of State<lb/> 
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>After a very careful study and close observation
of the United Vice Consul Robert S. Newton since
his return from England as reported in my despatch
No 34, I am compelled to state that I came to
the conclusion that a change ought to be made
in the United Vice Consular appointment of
this City, for the benefit of the United States 
Government, its citizens and commence.</p>

<p>I believe in fair dealings, but above
all in the appointment of peoples who
are attached to, and respect the United 
States of America, and who try to do 
their utmost to promote its commerce,
interest, and general success.</p>

<p>Messrs Robert S Newton and J. Carnegie
came here almost 14 years ago as clercks
of the late United States Commercial agent

<pb facs="Scan20033"/>

A.A. Silva of Boston Mass, and one of the richest
merchant of Angola.</p>

<p>A few years ago Mr Silva left for his home, Chealsea
Mass, but unfortunately died at sea from 
causes unknown.</p>

<p>Since Mr Silva death these two young men
clerks took the whole business of late Mr Silva
and have paid his brother Frederick A. Silva of
Charlestown Mass. the amount received from
the United States Government for services
as U.S. Vice Commercial Agent, and lately
promoted by Mr Jackson the U.S. Consul
who resigned his post after "one month
residence," as U.S. Vice Consul.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert S. Newton today is H.B.
Majesty paid Vice Consul in this city, and
being concerned with English gilding embroidery
&amp;a &amp;a cares no longer for the <unclear extent="one word"/>
of the Untied States &amp;a &amp;a &amp;a</p>

<p>I will not enter into particulars
concerning the gentlemen, although
I can charge him of disobedience to orders
&amp; others, but I will say that it is my
opinion and that without entertaining
any prejudice or bad feelings toward him 
whatsoever.

<pb facs="Scan20034"/>

Beside the right of his removal by my despatch
No 3 from State Depart. data March 15th
1882 and signed J. C. Bancroft Davis
Asst Secty. of State.</p>

<p>I must repeat that for the benefit of American
interests, "if such can be hoped for here," after
all the private letters I wrote to my old ship,
owners, merchants &amp;a with whom I am 
acquainted in Massachusetts, New York,
Maryland, Florida, North and South Carolina
and Maine; and considering the contents
of Capt. Perry's letters, changing his plans
for supplying the Americans Whaling
ships at Loanda &amp;a &amp;a That I call
the attention of the State Department
for an immediate change.</p>

<p>An United States Consul <unclear>came at</unclear> also
be her B. Majesty's Consul neither can
H. B. Majesty's Consul be a true United 
States Consul in this part of the Coast.</p>

<p>I would respectfully suggest that 
Mr Francises Martens Swart a well
educated gentleman, and a rising young
merchant of Loanda speaking several 
languages, he very lately ordered from the

<pb facs="Scan20035"/>

United States, the full cargo of Lumber &amp;a &amp;a who 
was brought here by the Am: Bark Horace
Scudder under <unclear>company and</unclear> the name of Newton Carnegie &amp; Co
I believe that this change will benefit
the American commerce &amp;a &amp;a</p>

<p>I will also report that during my short
absence north, an Am: Whaling bark was
lost south of Mossamedes The Capt, officers
and crew came to Loanda, and were sent
to Lisbon, by Portuguese mail steamer Portugal
on my return on board the U.S.S. Quinnebang
Capt A. Ludlow, I asked Mr. Newton
about the copy of affidavits &amp;a &amp;a concerning
the loss of that vessel and the amount 
he had paid for the ship wrecked crew
his answer was, that he had sent every
Home; and had no copies. I will
mention that in that case, one half of 
the crew were shipped in St. Helana
about 2 month previous of her last. and
instead of sending these men back to 
St Helena by one of the Vessels he had
chartered to carry cattles for the British
govt. at "Ascention" he forwarded them 
to Lisbon at a great expense.

<pb facs="Scan20036"/>

In fact Mr. Newton do not wish to have
any superior officer here and Mr. Jackson 
the late U.S. Consul here, went home and
resigned his consulate by Mr. Newton paying
him the full amount of his expenses from
home to Loanda and from Loanda to the 
Untied States.</p>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
January 15: 1884:</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Mr du Verge by letter dated
Novr 3: 1883, of which copy is herewith
enclosed, having informed me that he
intended to proceed to the United States
on leave of absence granted to him
by the Department, and being now in
charge of the Consulate, I have to
acknowledge the receipt of your
despatch No 20 of the 26th October
last, informing Mr du Verge that his
nomination of Francisco Markins Pevart
as Vice Consul to succeed me has been 
approved, and enclosing a black form
of bond which should be executed and 
<catchwords>returned</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan30007"/>

returned to the Department of State 
with information as to Mr Swart's 
nationality.</p>

<p>In compliance with this request I have
to inform you that Mr Swart is a 
Portuguese subject and a merchant
of this place, holding the appointment
of Spanish Vice Consul, but left for 
Europe in the month of July last
and is still absent; and I have not
any means of knowing the exact date
he intends to return, or whether as
so rumoured, he purposes residing
permanently in Lisbon.</p>

<p>I have therefore the honor to return 
<del>the blank</del> the blank force of bond
for such ulterior measures as may be
deemed fit.</p>

<p>Having thus become acquainted with 
the


<pb facs="Scan30008"/>

the fact of being suspended without
having rendered any resignation, or
informed in any way by Mr du Verge
of his having nominated Mr Swart
to fulfil the duties of Vice Consul, an
appointment not intimated to or 
acknowledged by the local Government,
I am reluctantly compelled to conclude 
that the Department must have been 
altogether misinformed on the subject,
and the representations made by 
Mr du Verge a compilation of
mistatements, which would appear
to be a leading characteristic of that 
officer in nearly all transactions
connected with his proceedings when
here.</p>

<p>As however Mr du Verge has
taken with him the official 
<catchwords>correspondence</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan30009"/>

correspondence book and the various 
despatches, prior to the one now adverted
to. I am unable to see on what grounds 
he demanded my substitution, after a 
service which has, for the last fourteen 
years been approved of by the Government</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I 
have to submit whether, conformably
with official procedure, and as a matter
of personal satisfaction, the Department
will not, prior to re-confirming
Mr. Swart's nomination, transmit to 
me a copy of Mr du Verge's despatch or despatches
on the subject, in order that I may
offer such explanations as the case
warrants.</p>

<p>Mr du Verge may or may 
not have been activated by 
consideration of a higher nature
<catchwords>than</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan30010"/>

than personal disappointment at
finding me unwilling to connect
him with my commercial house,
and although he had no grounds
for such expectations, his subsequent
proceedings in the Congo (where he
was employed at a salary, I understand
of £400 a year) as chief of the Vivi 
station of the Stanley Expedition, and
his compulsory retirement from that
post at the request of Major General
Sir Frederick Goldsmed, who came
out to the Congo last year, on a special
mission from the King of the Belgians,
have not tended to produce that 
confidence which should have
distinguished an officer of the Consular
Service, and who had not gained the 
consideration or respect either of the 
<catchwords>Governor</catchwords>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
14 June 1883.</p>

<p>To the Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to lay below the Department
of State the following circumstances connected with
the discharge of my duties as Vice-Consul for the 
United States at this port. Mr L de R du Verge
left Loanda for the Congo on the 16th ultimo by the
Portuguese Mail Steamer for the purpose it is reported
of arranging with Mr Stanley the details of the post he
has accepted under the Belgian Expedition without 
handing over to me the Archives of the Consulate or
acquainting me as to whether I should be able
to have access to any documents or forms which
might he required, although I saw that officer on
the day of his departure.</p>

<p>Had there been no immediate Consular duties
to perform I should have waited the return of Mr
Du Verge for an explanation of this, and also for an
explanation on a matter of a personal nature which
has recently come to light.</p>

<p>The facts of the case are these: On the arrival
on the third inst. of the wrecked crew of the American
Whaler "Merlin" lost South of Mossamedes, I called at 
the house of Mr T Marti, a Swiss, holding a Dry
Goods Retail Shop where Mr Du Verge had hired a 
room as his residence and offices, Mr Marti who
possesses the key gave me permission to enter but
would not permit me to take the Ships Register as
the Archives he said were left in his charge and I am 
<catchwords>unable</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan30019"/> 

unable to register my official correspondence in the
proper Official Book which appeared to be locked away.</p>

<p>Wishing to take to my Office the Ships
Register did not appear to me any infraction of
the rules or had Mr Marti any official right or 
Authority to interfere with me, for in the first place
the room offered no facilities for writing, and in
the Second I could not without great inconvenience
to myself obtain the assistance of my mercantile clerk
to write up the register.</p>

<p>That Mr Marti who does not possess the
highest reputation for soberness or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the Archives and superintend
my actions over theme, shows a want of official
consideration by Mr Du Verge and is more over contrary 
to the instructions.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances and not
possessing the key of the room no responsibility can
be attached to me for the safety of the Consular
papers but I shall endeavour to exercise such
supervision over them as is consistent with my 
relations with Mr Marti.</p>

<p>It may be inferred that there exists a
difference between Mr Du Verge and myself but such
is not the case if his friendly pretensions are to be 
considered as a proof of his sincerity and I am
quite at a loss to understand what motive he has 
to pass me over in matters appertaining to the
Consulate with which I have been connected for
a long period having been appointed to my present
position since 1868. And for many years have been 
in sole charge of the office without, I venture to 
state, giving the Department any cause of complaint
<catchwords>or</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan30020"/> 

or in any way failed to discharge the duties faithfully
and conscientiously</p>

<p>I may also state that my long residence
here as Merchant and holding the post of British-Vice-Consul 
which I presume is not incompatible with
my position as United States Vice-Consul, give me
a status that facilitates considerably the settlement
of Consular business with the local authorities, with
whom I have always been on the most friendly and
intimate relationship.</p>

<p>The information that has been given regarding
myself personally is that Mr Marti has failed to obtain
any one here to sign a bond for him to be Vice Consul at
Loanda, from which I infer that Mr Du Verge has
applied to the Department to have me substituted but 
on what ground I am unable to say.</p>

<p>In submitting the foregoing matters for the
information of the Department I have the honor to 
request that should there be no reason why I should
not continue to hold the post of Vice-Consul, that 
Mr Du Verge should be instructed to consign the
Archives of the Consulate to my charge whenever he
may absent himself and, should it be deemed
expedient, to call upon him to explain his reasons
for shewing such discourtesies to me, as I am
not his inferior save in official rank.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I am advised of the non-payment of the
two Bills No 7 $350 and No 8 for $174 drawn
in my favor by Consul Du Verge on the Secretary
of the Treasury on the ground that he was in a 
condition not responsible for his actions at the
time of signing.</p>

<p>I beg to enclose copy of a despatch I
find has been inserted in the Official Correspondence
Book by Mr Du Verge advising the drawing
of one of these bills.</p>

<p>These Bills were sent to me by Mr Du Verge
from Banana in a letter of which I have the 
honor to transmit a copy.</p>

<p>While Mr Du Verge was in the Congo he
ordered in his capacity as chief of the Station at
Vivi, of the Belgians Association. Several articles which
were charged to him and as it will be seen by the
enclosed Copy of Account, there remained a Balance
after payment of his Bills, which I did not for a  
moment doubt, due to him of £30:2:4 for which 
I remitted to him, by the packet of the 15th of last
<catchwords>month</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan30022"/> 

month a Bill on my Agents. The payment of that
Bill I have ordered to be stopped in the usual way
until further reasons are given for the non-payment 
of the said two Bills by the Secretary 
of the Treasury.</p>

<p>There will I venture to believe be very
little doubt in your mind that the allegation
set forth by Mr Du Verge is a vile invention to
serve his own ends and an act inconsistent with
integrity and honesty. If therefore Mr Du Verge
cannot be called upon by the Government to make
good the Amount he is now indebted to me I 
shall be under the painful necessity of prosecuting 
him by law</p>

<p>I may state that there are several persons
residents in this city who saw Mr Du Verge at
Banana in the Congo previous to his departure
for Europe as well as the Captain of the Steamer
in which he took passage could state that he 
did not appear to be in any way irresponsible
for his acts.</p>

visit the King of <unclear>Muata-Janvo</unclear> one of the most important
potentates in the interior of this part of Africa.</p>

<p>They take a large quantity of goods and will
require about 500 carriers which they hope to
arrange at Malange. I believe they take important
presents from the King of Portugal to the King of
<unclear>Muata-Janvo</unclear>. It is announced in the official paper
of this Province that the expedition is allowed Rs 19,320,000
for its expenses being a little over Rs 4000. Their intention is

afterwards cross over to Mozambique. The journey is

<p>Robt Newton Esq<lb/>
Vice Consul of U.S.A.<lb/>
at Loanda<lb/>
Africa.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>The following is a concise statement of the facts with reference
to our expulsion from Bailundo and Bihé.</p>

<p>The "American Mission" as we are commonly designated was
established in April 1884 in Bailundo and extended to Bihe 
in March of the present year. In both of these countries
we held the most friendly relations with the natives, both the
Sobas and the people at large. In Bihe these amicable
relations continued to the day of our departure and we still
have the invitation of the Loba of that country to come there 
in a body.</p>

<p>In Bailundo our peace was disturbed on the 15th of May by
a letter bearing the signature of the Soba &amp; his counsellors
commanding us to depart from Bailundo and all its
<catchwords>dependencies</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40005"/> 

dependencies and never to return and forbidding any of the
mission to visit the King in person as was our custom when
carrying on any important negotiation with him.</p>

<p>So sudden a change in the treatment of the Soba who
had always protected us in every way possible to him
required explanation. Negociations continued for
six weeks brought to light the following facts:</p>

<p>Mr Braga a Trader at Catumbella had gone to Bihé
and there tried to induce the Soba to expel that part of the
mission which was located there, but failed to
accomplish his purpose the Soba not only refusing
to send away those who were there, but inviting the whole
mission to locate in his country, a thing which was
under the circumstances impossible.</p>

<p>Proceeding to Bailundo Mr Braga brought the
full power of his influence to bear upon the Soba there.
He informed him that we intended to kill the Soba
blow up his village, destroy his family, and take
possession of the country. When that information 
<catchwords>failed</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40006"/> 

failed to move the Soba he told him, we had committed
crimes in our country, and he had been sent by the
Governor of Benguella, to drive us out and if the Soba
should refuse to send us away he would get
himself and his country into trouble.</p>

<p>At the same time Mr B kindly consented to come 
and occupy our village and give the Soba and his men
all the Whiskey they wanted if he would drive us out and
he even went so far in his benevolent offers as to say he
would be willing to burn our houses and kill us all if the 
King would give him permission to do so. But the King
refused. Several of the Mission heard Mr B's Secretary
say that his master advised the King to kill us but the 
King refused.</p>

<p>Though unwilling to have us killed the Soba was
quite unable to withstand the pressure which was brought
upon him to drive us out and we were compelled to 
leave July 4th. Mr B. immediately taking possession
of our houses.</p>

<pb facs="Scan40007"/> 

<p>We reached Benguella July 29th after a severe and to
the ladies and children, perilous journey with our
lives, a little clothing and nothing more. All of our 
large and costly outfit having been of necessity left
behind.</p>

<p>The Governor of Benguella to whom we applied
for redress, has in accordance with his own request been
furnished with an estimate of our loss.</p>

to assist them in every way and
glad to see them going ahead
and following in the footsteps
of the Association, and that 
he has no idea whatever of
putting any difficulty in the
way of any person wishing to
open trade. He is trying to 
get things into good working
order as up to the present
there has been no system whatever 
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

and a great waste of money.</p>

<p>He talks of a small railway 
from <unclear>Yur</unclear> to Stanley Pool a
distance of about 230 miles to
open up the country calculating
that the coast would be £2000,000.
but to show any result he would
require a traffic of at least
100 tons a day at freight of
about £4 pr ton. I think this
would be a very bad investment 
as there are not many qualities
of African produce that could
afford to pay such a price unless
it was obtained in the interior 
for mere normal value and 
I must say that I do not see 
where the 100 tons a day are to 
come from.</p>

<p><catchwords>I</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40019"/> 

I also met here Captain Grant
Elliott, Administrator for
the Association at Loango, and
his idea is a railway from
the Quillo and up the Niarri
valley which would be almost
a direct line to Stanley Pool
and much less expensive as
they would not have such a
mountainous district to go 
through.</p>

<p><unclear>Lately</unclear> in the Congo between
Nokki and Boma the Dutch
House had two factories, one at
Caicamazio and the other at
Mussuca burnt down by the 
natives, suffering great loss, there
being at the time over 6000 lbs of
ivory and 7 tons of rubber besides 
<catchwords>a</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40020"/> 

a great quantity of goods
for trade; the loss is estimated
at £15,000.</p> 

<p>The Dutch have attacked 
the natives and burnt a number
of villages and taken the King
and Queen of Caicamazio prisoners.</p>

<p>I found the German Man
of War "Moewe" had been at Banana
taking Coal and sailed for Angra
Pequena on the 16th September.
She had Dr Nachtigal on board 
and I heard that a large German
Expedition is reported as about
to start form Angra Pequena
for the Upper Congo, so no doubt
Dr Nachtigal has gone there to
weet them</p>

<p>At Landana I found the
<catchwords>French</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40021"/> 

French Man of War "Segond" and
the Portuguese Gunboat "Sado"
with the Secretary of the Government
of Angola on board, swing to a 
question between the French
missionaries established there
and the natives about some ground
that they (the missionaries) had
taken charge of, and they had
requested a man of War to come
to their assistance, as they would 
not recognize the authority of the
Portuguese Delegate who was in 
charge, as Landana was supposed
to be within the Portuguese Protectorate.</p>

<p>The first question the French 
took up was that Landana was
within the disputed territory of
5° 12' &amp; 8° south, and after the 
<catchwords>Observations</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40022"/> 

observations had been taken by the
officers of both ships it was determined 
that Landana was not within
the Portuguese Protectorate, but
within the disputed territory, so
the French were perfectly justified
in settling the question with the
missionaries without the interference
of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>The line of 5° 12' south comes
nearly to the south bank of the
Chiloango river, so that Landana
is within the territory of 5° 12' south
and 8° south and the Protectorate
of Massabi and Landana is really
of very little importance as nearly
all the trade is passed through
Landana; no doubt it is a great
disappointment to the Portuguese
<catchwords>but</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40023"/> 

but as they have got a treaty
with the Chief at Landana they
may take charge of it at some
future day. I think it little else
but just that they should as the
natives with few exceptions talk
Portuguese and any palaver
whatever is obliged to be decided
in that language</p>

<p>At Loango I visited the
merchants and the Chief of the
International Association who
gave some information that may
be useful about the disputed
points on the coast. I therefore
beg to enclose a sketch map.
The colours Ochre show the territory
occupied by the French.</p>

<pb facs="Scan40024"/> 

<p>Do "Green" which the
French are disputing with the
Association.</p>

<p>Do "Blue" the Portuguese
Protectorale of Massabi and
Landana as it is now admitted
to be.</p>

<p>The red points are places at which
the Association has stations.
At Loango there is a French
Lieutenant and some soldiers
who are in constant questions
with the Association as they claim
the territory from Granville to
Ponta Banda, and are giving
them as much trouble as they
possibly can, as they say they
wish to pay them off here for
the manner in which De Brazza
<catchwords>was</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40025"/> 

was treated by the Association
at Stanley Pool</p>

<p>On arrival of any vessel on
the coast it is usual for the
Merchant to hoist their flags to 
show their nationality and I was
surprised when I went on shore
accompanied by the captain of 
the Man of War to see the
Merchants hauling down their
flags, and was informed by them
that the French Commandante 
has issued a circular informing
them that they were not allowed 
to hoist flags except on Sundays 
or when the mail steamer came.
Here the houses are two American
and four Portuguese but the trade
is nearly all direct with England
<catchwords>I</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan40026"/> 

I noticed at several of the French
places all the Merchants are obliged
to hoist the French flag no matter
what nation they belong to and
I hear that any vessel proceeding
up the river above Gaboon are
obliged to hoist French colors.</p>

<p>Black Point is also a French
station, and there is here established
a sailor and 4or 5 soldiers, but
is a place of little importance as
to trade. I touched at several other
places on the coast, but I have
nothing of importance to relate
regarding them. Trade is bad
and there are great complaints
all along the coast.</p>

Dr Nachtigal is on board and proceeds North

proceeds home, the Moẅe still remaining on
the station. From a conversation I had with
Dr Nachtigal, who stayed at Angra Pequena
while the "Moẅe" went to the Cape, and who
went some distance into the interior, it seems

that the principal duties of this Consulate at this port

<p>Taking charge of distressed subjects principally belonging
to crews of Whalers; during the last 18 months about 60
have applied to this Consulate and they would have been
in great difficulties if no Consulate existed. Generally
two trading vessels come every year, and the imports
from America may be put down on an average in
this way at about $12000. The exports are nil as
there are no American houses here and the Produce
is sent principally to Lisbon and Liverpool</p>

<p>Very often Whalers come into Port who as a rule would be in
great difficulties with their crews in the event of their
being no Consulate. Last year I had 14 Whalers in
Port at on time.</p>

Mission lately expelled from Bailunda &amp; Bihé. Since that
date Mr Walters, Chief of the Mission has been here and I

Governor has promised to do all in his power to assist the

Bailunda &amp; Bihé requesting them to do all in their power to
assist the Mission and informing the said chiefs that any
persons presenting themselves for the future as representing
the Government, must present a similar seal before they are
to be recognised as such. Mr Walters has returned to
Benguella and seems to think he will not have much
trouble for the future. Mr Saunders another member of
the Mission has returned to Bailunda and they appear
to have great hopes of recovering the greater part of their
property.</p>

<note>Department of State Received Mar 2 1885</note>

<p>Loanda<lb/>
November 18 1884</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I received your despatch of the
17th ult in which you not only enclosed
the guarantees that the American
Mission wishes to re-establish itself
in Bailundo, but even an account
of the effects and their value lost
by the mission, which are supposed
to be in possession of the Sobba who
is held to be responsible for them.
No one saw with greater regret than
myself, that the Sobba of Bailudo
could commit the same violence to
the American Missionaries as he has
at since committed on the Portuguese
merchants and which certainly, neither
you Sir, nor the Mission can think 
that such violences could have been ordered
authorised or even insinuated either by
me or any other Portuguese with the
least investiture of authority. Of 
<catchwords>this</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50008"/> 

this the missionaries ought to be convinced
as the governor of Benguella has more
than once repeated it, and this I now
confirm</p>

<p>In the interior the Sobbas far from
the sight of civilised authority, commit
thefts and extortions, that constitute one
of the greatest risks of one employed
in the civilisation of the African races
who as savages are eminently suspicions
and no one can certainly make the
European Authorities responsible for 
this special character, at most times
excited in their malpractices by political
intention and some times ostensible, at
others secretly manifested for the
travellers and missionaries who
parting from the scientific sphere
or from preaching the Gospel
give to their position in the
interior an irritant situation of which
anyone can imagine with more or
less accuracy when he judges himself
prejudiced by these intentions, in his
interests, and especially that <catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50009"/> 

of commercial gain.</p>

<p>By what is affirmed by the missionaries,
it appears that they were given notice
to leave Bailundo in eight days and
even then they stayed six weeks, and
it seems only rational that during
that time they should have sent
one of their members to Benguella
to obtain a letter from the
Governor to the Sobba to assure
him that in whatever intrigues 
my name or that Governor's might
be involved, had no foundation whatever
and was utterly false.</p>

<p>This the missionaries did not do and
consequently they have only themselves
to blame. What part the Portuguese
merchant Braga weight have had in
the matter that very much. I lament
to have been the determination of the
Sobba of Bailundo, I cannot tell
you, as I await information from
the Governor of Benguella who left
for the interior with the intention
of complaining of the affair and
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50010"/>

to relate personally what had taken
place to enable one to do ensure justice.
At present we have the simple
declaration of the missionaries, there
is yet to be heard the Sobba, and 
it is this that I enjoined the 
Governor to do.</p>

<p>The habitual complaint of the
merchants of Benguella is that
the American Mission tried by
every possible means to deviate 
the flow of commerce from Bengulla,
and this might perchance have
influenced the spirit of one less
cautious to have provoked the
Sobba and his ministers to do what
they did, thus giving them a pretext,
which until to day they have
not wanted, to behave in a 
like manner to some of the Portuguese
merchants, under futile reasons of
"fetish" that have only had their
origin from the <sic>coveteousness</sic> and
freediness of the heathen population, always
incited by the knowledge that they may 
<catchwords>have</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50011"/>

have of the existence of goods in the
hands of the inland trader.</p>

<p>The experienced opinion of Silva Portó
is that what has now occurred to the
American Mission he had long thought
one day would happen as he well
knows the character of the Bailundos,
not being able to state if the affair
really occurred as the missionaries state
or even if any Portuguese merchants
directly or indirectly took part.
The comportment of this <sic>illustrous</sic> 
Portuguese settler to the English Missionary
whose letter you enclose in one of your
despatches to which I reply wakes his
statement altogether beyond questioning
as he offered him his house in Bihé to
stop as long as he pleased so long as he
only preached the gospel and did not
enter into policies, for from the moment
he did he would have to leave the
house in order not to compromise Silva
Porto with the natives.</p>

<p>Not less is the complaint of the Sobba
against the American Missionaries concerning
<catchwords>their</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50012"/>

political interference than is the
complaint of the Merchants of
Benguella concerning the supposed
meddling in trade to which I already
referred and therefore it will be
much better that at the missionaries
on their return to Bailundo make
a solemn declaration or oath according
to their religion before <sic>witnessess</sic> and
the authorities that they do not intend
to influence in any prejudicial way
the trade of Benguella, but that they 
simply go to preach the Gospel and
the doctrine of Christ. The oath that
I suggest would for my part be
perfectly unnecessary but the public 
spirit in the country is irritated
against the missionaries, and in
as much as such a promise would 
be a means of pacifying and
dispersing any doubts that may remain
and which certainly can cost nothing
to the conciliating and Evangelical spirit
of the missionaries.</p>

<p>As you Sir, can well imagine I cannot 
<catchwords>give</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50013"/>

give a decisive opinion upon the
subject without first having the
report of the Governor of Benguella's
voyage into the interior, nor can I 
guarantee the behavior of the Sobba
and have not sufficient forces in 
Bailundo, and much less can I
exact from him the payment that
the mission claims.</p>

<p>The mission established itself in the
interior without consulting the Portuguese
government as to what port of guarantee
it might have for its members and properly,
ran of its own accord the risk <unclear extent="one or two words"/>
to the kind of exploration in which it 
was engaged. If the government had
been consulted it would most certainly
have said that the natives of Bailundo
are treacherous and that only by a 
miracle could the missionaries uphold
themselves, more so as soon as the Mission
had a means and especially that of goods,
incentive to the habitual malpractices
of the native.</p>

<p>The American Mission can then when 
<catchwords>it</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50014"/>

likes, establish itself where best it thinks
fit; what the Portuguese government 
cannot do is to guarantee that
the Sobba shall not repeat his violences
because that, no country could do
to which he was a vassal, nor could
it keep a competent military force the
expense of which no mission could
compensate.</p>

<p>What the Portuguese government can
and will do as soon as it has
properly heard the question is to
place regular authorities in Bailundo
and Bihé to maintain the equilibrium
of intercourse between the Sobba and 
Merchants or Missionaries, and so
forewarn itself by trustworthy
notices &amp; reports against the affirmations
of other contradictory parties, and
in that case while the Portuguese
Government act like this they will
have to limit the guarantee that
they offers to those establishing themselves 
in Bihé and Bailundo,
which can reasonably be claimed
<catchwords>taking</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50015"/>

taking into consideration the state of
the people of these two districts at the 
same time noting that the guarantee
will be <unclear extent="one word"/> in the districts like
Cacondo &amp; Quillengues where the preaching
of the gospel would be as useful as
in Bailundo or Bihé; and that will
have to be combined between the
interested parties and the native 
authorities of the place before a Portuguese
authority that will be placed there,
when missionaries or merchants wish
to establish themselves in neighbourhoods
where only reigns native customs, simply
restricted by vassalage sworn to the
King of Portugal</p>

<p>As to the English Missionary
the writer of the letter to which
I have already referred, it appears
to me that the prestige of the settler
Silva Porto to whom he is much indebted
and from whom he has derived great
help to him it ought to be sufficient
guarantee to affirm, that as much
to him and his subordinates, or even 
<catchwords>others</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50016"/>

independent of him, that they
will not have to complain of
any interference in their work
of civilisation, so long as they
keep themselves to that, and do 
not interfere in politics whether
native or European, in which case
the Portuguese government cannot
be responsible in anyway whatever
for the behaviour of the savage
tribes, amongst whom they may
establish their theatre of operation
contrary to its ostensible ends.</p>

<p>In reply to your despatch No 8 I have the honor
to enclose copies of despatches Nos 1 to 4 received from

in November of 1883 per ss "Senegal" for Liverpool</p>

<p>When he left for the Congo in July of that year
he handed the Archives over to me as per enclosure

cover Clerks expenses. On November 26th as per 
enclosure No 3 he advised me that he had forwarded
me two drafts to cover my account; viz for the £10 per
month and other money I had advanced to him.</p>

<p>These Bills I received and forwarded for 
payment to America, but they were refused payment
Mr Du Verge I believe having countermanded the advice
of same, stating that he was not in his proper state
of mind when he signed them. Altogether
Mr Du Verge has swindled me out of about £150 
and during his stay here, he has behaved in such
a manner, that I am afraid it will be difficult

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the Department
that I have today taken passage for the sailor,
Albert Svenson to St Thiago per ss "Portugal."</p>

<p>This man is a deserter from the Bark
"Horace Scudder" having stolen a boat and gone
on shore at Novo Redondo, he was handed over
to me by the Portuguese Government having been 
brought to Loanda, by the Gun vessel "Vilhena"
together with another man also a deserter. I 
put them in prison, but this man falling ill
had to go to the hospital and was unable to 
leave in the ship</p>

<p>For his passage I have passed a draft 
on the Secretary of State @ 15 d/o in favor of
Snr Ernst George, Agent at Lisbon of the Steamers
for $36 94/100.</p>

Loanda 10 April 1885.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to enforce you that on the
18th of March last, Bishop W. Taylor accompanied by
18 men 7 women and 16 children, arrived
here in the "Biafra" British Mail Steamer from
Liverpool.</p>

<p>They have come from the United States to
establish Missions, in this Colony which have for
their object the teaching of the natives, not only in
religious matters but also in Industrial pursuits</p>

<p>The Governor General being at present
absent from Loanda, I could not present the
Bishop to him, he however will return at the
end of this month and I shall then do so.
I do not anticipate any objection on his part to
the Mission, but on the contrary think that he
will render them such assistance as lays in
his province, to establish themselves ad will
extend his protection to them so long as
they confine themselves to the objects they
ostensibly purpose.</p>

<p>My impression is, that a Mission
composed as this is, of so great a number of
people including so many women and children
<catchwords>coming</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan50025"/>

coming to this Colony is not a well advised measure
They come here as a "self-supporting" mission to a 
country entirely unknown to them, and unfortunately
without the apparent requisite means to make their
mission a success. Their funds are very meagre
to commence with and the Country is not one
to give immediate returns as in their case is 
necessary.</p>

<p>The son of the Bishop, Mr Ross Taylor leaves
by this Mail "Corisco" for Liverpool taking with him
his wife (who has been ill since her arrival here)
and four children. Another member of the 
Mission a Mr MacKay also is anxious to leave
through ill health, but has not the means to do
so. Other members are suffering from the effects of
the climate and I very much doubt if their
condition will improve when they get up country
and have only themselves and their own efforts
to depend upon.</p>

<p>They have fixed on two sites some three
hundred miles from here, in the interior, selected by
one of their number Dr Somers and as soon as they
get the permission of the Governor General several
of the members will move to them.</p>

30th September 1886</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to request
the Department to grant me leave of 
absence. I wish to take my wife to 
England in December next as I find
the climate does not agree with his,
and as I intend returning in March
next, I shall be absent only three or
four months.</p>

<p>I beg alas to request the Department 
to allow me the liberty to
nominate my chief clerk in my
commercial business, Mr Edward
Bannister, to act as Vice Concil 
during my absence, Mr Bent who
formerly acted being no longer in 
my

<pb facs="Scan60025"/>

my employ and not likely to return
to Loanda.</p>

<p>As I have been here now nearly
twenty years I find it necessary that
I should visit a cold climate more
frequently than I have hitherto done
and when last at home my Doctor
recommended that I should at
least try and take a run home once
a year.</p>

<p>In consideration of these circumstances, 
the unhealthy nature
of this locality, and the long since
I have resided here I take the liberty
to solicit the Department for a standing
permission to take leave of absence
whenever circumstances compel
my departure from this place.</p>

<p>This request may appear to be

<pb facs="Scan60026"/>

a departure from the general
custom of the Department, but
I trust that the special nature
of the case may induce you to
take the matter into favorable
consideration.</p>

rise and fall in the rainy reasons.
During the year 1885 the rains were 
very light, and this year they have
been lighter still. The small rains
usually commence in September and
end the latter end of November or
beginning of December, and the heavy
rains commence in February and
end in the middle of May.</p>

<p>Such light rain falls have not 
been known for twenty years, but
we may now look for a gradual
increase in quantity up to the
year 1890, and again a gradual
diminution after that year until
a drought is again experienced.</p>

<p>These influences on agriculture
may be appreciated, and as the

are vegetable, want of hair has
caused complete stagnation in
trade and commerce. Add to this
the very low prices Coffee, Oil, and 
Rubber have commanded in European
markets and the cause of the crisis is
plain</p>

<p>Exports. The exports are principally 
Coffee, rubber, palm oil,
coton, <del>rubber</del> and bees-wax. The
most important however is coffee, a
large amount of capital being expended
in its growth. It is mostly exported
to Portugal and consequently gives employment 
to some Portuguese shipping.</p>

<p>But little of the produce of the 
province is shipped to other countries. 
The total value of exports from
Loanda during 1885 was $897,930 0/00
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

as against $1,234.900 0/00 in 1884.</p>

<p>We can calculate only on one
vessel a year from the states and
that vessel is the barque "Horace
Scudder" of Boston. She is loaded
by her owner with the articles
mentioned and sundries comprising
<unclear>tar</unclear>, <unclear>lard</unclear>, clocks, biscuits &amp;c.
She does not as a rule sell all her
cargo here. Timber as a rule,
sells readily but is by no means
a certain sale. Soap and petroleum 
<catchwords>also</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70006"/>

also generally find a ready sale.
She takes from here drafts in payment,
and on reaching Gaboon
after calling at intermediate ports
<unclear extent="one word"/> red-wood and loads with
that and what ebony she can
get, for the States. She left here
early in the year and we may look
for her again in November or
December. As trade improves better
sales may be made, but not some
goods, or qualities of goods that are
frequently sent here. The idea seems
to prevail that the damaged and very
inferior goods are suitable enough
for this market. This is a mistake
and damages the reputation of 
the United States as a source of 
supply, and I have frequently 
<catchwords>complained</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70007"/>

complained to captains and
supercargoes for so carelessly and
recklessly injuring the good names
and commercial reputation of
their country. I will substantiate
my remarks by giving my frequent
experience in one article, viz - flour.
A considerable quantity is brought
in United States vessels from time
to time, but is generally more or less
damaged, or of very inferior quality. 
The consequence is that instead of
finding a ready sale at good prices
it is with the utmost difficulty 
that purchasers can be found
for small quantities at low prices
and this is used to mix with
Portuguese flour in small quantities 
and to make very inferior
<catchwords>bread</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70008"/>

bread which is need for convicts
and prisoner's rations.</p>

<p>Besides coffee a great quantity
of sugar cane is grown in the colony 
from which rum is distilled and is
an important article of domestic
trade, but little being imported
from other countries.</p>

<p>The differential duties make
direct trade with this province from 
other countries somewhat disadvantageous, 
principally however
to the shipping interest in most
cases. These duties operate as
follows: On goods manufactured 
in any other country than
Portugal and imported direct
form that country in other than
Portuguese vessels the whole amount

<pb facs="Scan70009"/>

of duty according to the tariff is 
passable. If, being of foreign manufacture, 
they pass through the custom house in Lisbon and are reshipped 
thence in Portuguese Vessels
they pay 2% ad valorum in Lisbon
and 70% here, of the duty. If <unclear>of</unclear>
Portuguese manufacture and shipped
in Portuguese vessels, they pay 
only 2% in Lisbon and 30% here.</p>

<p>On the 28th of last month
the anniversary of the birth of the
Prince Royal of Portugal, the
inauguration of the West African
Telegraph Cable look place, and
on or about the 16th of this month
the Railway from Loanda to Ambaca 
will be inaugurated. The 
contractor for the construction of
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70010"/>

the line is Mr John Burnay of
Lisbon and <unclear>Oposs</unclear>; The sub-contractor 
being Col: D. E. Davenport
an American, at present here, and
having offices at 2 Moorgate St.
London. He is daily expecting two
longe vessels from the states with
material for construction, and I 
can see no reason why merchants
and manufactures in the states,
of such goods as will be required
not only in construction but in
the maintenance of the line, stations,
rolling stock and stores should
not compete for the furnishing
of same.</p>

<p>The agriculture of the country
is in the most primitive state still,
and only on coffee and sugar-cane
<catchwords>estates</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan70011"/>

estates is some attention paid
to improvements and even there
much more might be done.</p>

<p>A very enterprising missionary 
from the United States, Bishop
William Taylor arrived here some
two years ago with a few families 
and single people who are located
by the bishop in places chosen as
being suitable for farms and the
raising of live stock. He has got
<unclear extent="one word"/> ploughs, materials for taming
and many other useful implements.
He not only expects to make these
stations self supporting but also
as schools for instructing the natives,
and teaching them farming, <unclear extent="one word"/>,
boat making, carpentering and
other industries and occupations.

I have had intimate relations 
with him commercially
and as Vice Consul and have
been much struck at the great
energy displayed by a man
of his years, and the faith
he has in his enterprises.</p>

<p>It is sincerely to be hoped that
the ultimate results may be
as successful as the venerable,

<p>I have the honor to
inform the Department that
the work of construction of the
Railway from Loanda to Ambaca,
and styled the Royal Trans-African 
Railway, was inaugurated
on the 31st ultimo by the Governor 
General of the  Province, assisted
by the Bishop of Angola and
Congo, and the principal officials
of the Province.</p>

<p>The first sod was cut and
the first stone laid on the site
intended for the construction
of the principal station, by
the Governor General, and a

divine blessing on the work 
<catchwords>was</catchwords>

<p>The works are commerced
and large members of natives
and others employed; and it is
expected the line will be ready
for traffic within the time
mentioned in the contract,
viz: four years.</p>

<p>A vessel with a cargo of
material for constructions is
expected every day from the
states, and most likely as the
work progresses other product
of the United States will be in
requisition.</p>

Department, on my arrival here, that
this Consulate possessed no property
belonging to the Government, except
that mentioned no inventory enclosed
in despatch No 5, under date of Oct
1st, 1887.</p>

<p>The fact that Vice Consul Newton
is the British Consul and at the
same time head of a Congo Commercial 
house, has been no reason
for the U.S. Consulate being, in a 
sense, an adjustment, and has removed
any recognized necessity for the

of office <unclear>accessions</unclear>.</p>

<p>To enable me to perform the duties
of my office I have been forced by
the exigency, tho purchase as per before
mentioned <unclear>Form</unclear>.</p>

<p>I would respectfully advise the
Department that for the expense
of moving archives and for their
proper presentation, a further allowance
is necessary.</p>

<p>To make this purchase I have used
money intended for my family in New York,
and hoping that my action will meet
with approval. I have drawn upon

November 14th 1887.</p>

<p>Hon. James D. Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to forward
to the Department the following:</p>

<p>Some years ago American
vessels had no difficulty in securing a
cargo of the products of this province. A trade
was growing between the United States and
Angola gathering every day more and more
in importance, but unfortunately for its
continuance, our troubles at home caused
its abandonment and, since then, it has
never been resumed.</p>

<p>The periodical arrival of
steamers and sailing vessels from Europe.
The building of railways and water works
by European capital, shows what value this 
province has in the eyes of commercial
<catchwords>Europe.</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80027"/>

Europe.</p>

<p>There are five lines of steamers
running from European ports to Loanda, two
from England, two from Portugal and one 
from Germany.</p>

<p>The Portuguese steamers are
subsidized. Leaving Lisbon on the 6th of 
every month, calling at Madeira, St. Vincent, Banana, 
Princess Island, Ambriz, Loanda, and
as far south as Mossamedes, taking about seventy
days to make the round voyage.</p>

<p>The English steamers leave
Liverpool about every thrice weeks, taking about
three months to make the round trip.</p>

<p>The German steamers are
irregular, seldom going south of Loanda.</p>

<p>Besides the above, the
Dutch Trading Company have a steamer
making about five round trips a year.</p>

<p>The arrival of sailing
vessels from England, Portugal, Germany,
France, and Holland, are frequent, from the
United States and about every eighteen months.</p>

<p>The principal imports
from each country are, cotton grade
<catchwords>woollen</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80028"/>

woollen goods, hardware, crockery, machinery,
cutlery, powder, guns, provisions &amp;c, from
England; spirits, beer, guns, powder, hardware 
&amp;c, from Germany, flour, petroleum,
soap from America; wines, silks &amp;c. from
France. Most of these goods are sent
to Loanda via Lisbon, re-exported from
Portugal in Portuguese vessels, there is a 
reduction in the import duties of 30%.</p>

<p>The exports are bees' wax, coffee,
cotton, cattle, hides, dried fish, gums, ivory,
india rubber, oils, orchella weed, palm
kernals sesame seed, tobacco and fibre.</p>

<p>Coffee is sent to Portugal.
Holland and Germany, cotton to England-
Portugal and Holland, hides to Portugal,
ivory, rubber, archilla weed oils, palm
kernals, sesame seed, and tobacco to England
and Portugal, cattle and dried fish to
French and Portuguese dependencies.</p>

<p>The export duties is 3% on
shipments in <sic>Portugese</sic> vessels and 5% in 
foreign vessels. The differential duties does
not so much effect the manufacturing 
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80029"/>

as the shipping industries.</p>

<p>The promise of Angola is one of
the most important on the African Coast. It
is rich in minerals and its soil is exceptionally
fertile.</p>

<p>Agriculture is in a progressive
condition. Large plantations of coffee, and
sugar cane, owned by Europeans as well
as smaller ones, cultivated by the natives, line
the many rivers that irrigate the country.</p>

<p>Whether the United States would 
be benefited by taking part in the trade of
this coast, is worthy of consideration. There
are few, if any, articles imported into the
province, which we do not produce as
cheap, if not cheaper, than any country
with whom we would have to compete, nor
would we be more embarrassed by the
laws which regulate the collection of duties
than the most favored nation.</p>

<p>The city of Loanda contains
about fifteen thousand inhabitants, one
thousand of these are white, mostly convicts,
carpentering, brick laying, shoemaking,
tailoring, grogshop keeping on the
<catchwords>common</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80030"/>

common, avocations.</p>

<p>The city is divided into a 
lower, and, an upper town. The upper
town is built upon a hill surrounding one
side of the lower town which nestles at its
base, along the shore, and it, with the harbor
formed by the beautiful bay, are over
shadowed by the walls of Fort St Miguel
which perched upon a bola precipice at
the waters edge, protects the port.</p>

<p>Many large and important
public buildings are in efficient working
order; a creditable public market building 
is busily occupied during the day
by buyers and sellers; a custom house,
situated near the water-side and opposite 
to a large structure belonging to
the Department of Public Works, offers
every convenience for the rapid transaction 
of business. There are a number
of churches, but they are sparsely attended 
except on special occasions. a large
hospital capable of accommodating
eight hundred patients and having
a full staff of efficient officers and
<catchwords>nurses</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80031"/>

nurses, is most happily located upon the hill.</p>

<p>The climate is unhealthy, many
deaths are caused by small-pox, a disease
common at the change of season. It is
impossible to learn how many die as the
records are very unreliable.</p>

<p>The streets of the lower city
are, as a rule, wide, but the sand
settling into them from the higher land,
has formed a deposit several inches in
depth of loose earth very hard to walk in.
There are several well paved roads running
from the lower to the upper city, where
are the Governor's palace, the prison, the
barracks, the treasury, and other public 
offices, also an observatory where observation
of temperature, height of barometer, &amp;c., are
taken daily. The upper city, from being
exposed fully to the sea breeze, is the
healthiest part of the town.</p>

<p>There, are two newspapers
published, on weekly, one semi-weekly,
one is, an official bulletin and the
other is devoted to general news.</p>

<p>There is a fair military
<catchwords>band</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80032"/>

band which plays in a public garden
treated in the upper town, three times
a week, with the exception of this
there, are no public announcements.</p>

<p>Loanda is in telegraphic commu=
nication with Europe as well as with a 
number places in the interior. Telephone
in the city are in constant use.</p>

<p>The Banco Nacional Ultramarino
of Lisbon have a branch here as well as
others, at Mossamedes, and Benguella. It is
largely interested in the sugar and coffee
growing industries, holding mortgages on
many plantations, an account of money
advanced to work the same.</p>

<p>Quite a large business is done
by the bank in the sale of its paper, as
a large general <unclear extent="one word"/> business is done here
and in the up country for a currency having
only a local value and with which bank
paper is bought for use abroad.</p>

<p>Stores here with a stock of 
general merchandize, are numerous and
all of them seem to be doing a fair 
business.</p> 

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80033"/>

The cost of living in Loanda
is high, or dear, the cheapest accommodation
costing 2 Rs 500 i.e. $3.70/100 per diem.</p>

<p>Although large sales are made
in the city, yet Loanda is but a depot
for the supply of factories established in
the interior, at least eighty per cent of the
exports are perchased by factors employed 
by the merchants in the city.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Quanza
are the trading stations of Calumbo, Bruto,
Maximo, Massanga, Cambambe, Dondo, and
others. All of these are centres of trade for
many miles around them, and are visited
twice a week by steamers plying between
them and Loanda, as well as by an
overland mail every few days.</p>

<p>The output of the Quanza
District is very large, and taxes severely
the carrying capacity of the present
means of transportation, yet it is nothing
in comparison to what it will be in
the near future, where the rail road becomes 
a factor in opening the interior.
Running for hundreds of mile through

an exceedingly rich, and fertile country, it
will cause many new industries to spring 
to life, not the least of which will be
the gathering of woods valuable for their
application to dye and furniture making.
New impetus will be given to the agricultural
industries, for whereas now <unclear>inter-</unclear>transportation 
is both expensive and difficult,
then the plantations being rapidly and
cheaply emptied of their products will
encourage the planters and farmers to 
exert themselves for larger profits.</p>

<p>The work of laying pipes
for the purpose of bringing the water of
the Bengo into Loanda is most satisfactorly
progressing and it is expected will be 
finished by next August.</p>

<p>During the year which ended
on the 30th of June 1887, 3288 <sic>passenser</sic>
arrived in Loanda, and 2828 sailed from
the same place; of 122 vessels entered 54
were Portuguese Steamers, and 40 were foreign, also
22 Portuguese sailing vessels, and 6 foreign; those
that sailed were 57 Portuguese Steamers and
40 Foreign; 25 Portuguese sailing vessels and
<catchwords>6</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan80035"/>

foreign. Total tonnage of those entered 95,755
Tons; those sailed 98,734 Tons Value of Imports
was $1,034,988.50/100; the value of Exports was
$773,663.00/100.</p>

<p>Hon James D. Porter.<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to call the
attention of the Department to the fact that
that this Consular District extends from
Ambriz in 7° 49' S. Lat., to Cape Frio 18°
20' S. Lat, and from 13° E. Long. to 18° E Long.</p>

<p>By referring to dispatch No.
13., having same date as this, it will be
seen that the commercial nations of Europe
consider that this country is worthy of attention.
Confident of its future they are investing 
large sums in opening the interior in
internal improvements, and in the cultivation
of its trade.</p>

<p>Whether it would be advantageous 
to the United States for it to become
actively interested in this trade is a 
<catchwords>question</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90002"/>

to be decided by its merchants, but before
they, can so, decide it is necessary that
they should be thoroughly advised as to
the nature of the trade and the many
causes affecting it, for now to them it is,
in a commercial sense, almost an unknown
land.</p>

<p>The object of the Government in 
sustaining a Consulate here is, I judge, to
advance the commercial interests of its country.
That this can be done under the present arrangement 
of things, it seems to me, is doubtful
unless information is given which will influence
commercial action the problems, as
to whether this trade should be cultivated by
our merchants, will long remain unsolved.</p>

<p>A residence of many years in
Africa has taught me that, to speak advisedly
and correctly of its trade, it is not well
to confide in the statements of merchants
and traders who desirous of presenting opposition,
have no hesitation in using as a means
to that end, falsehood, but it is necessary that
that knowledge should be gained which is to 
be had only by personal examination.</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90003"/>

The difference in the habits, customs
and language of the natives of districts <sic>seperated</sic>
from one another by only a few miles, while
great, are not more pronounced than those which
are to be found in the lower animal life, the
flora, the <sic>vegatation</sic> and the physical conformation 
of the country for instance, the
natives of one district superstitiously refuse to
gather certain products, yet the tribe adjoining
them use the same product as their principal
article of trade, that one class of <sic>vegatation</sic> is
not common to the country is evidenced by
the fact that in certain districts nothing grows
but that giant of the forest, the "Baobab,"
from which is taken a fibre known to commerce
as "Andasonia."</p>

<p>I hope that the Department will
concur with me in thinking that this Consulate
would be useful if it should become actively
engaged in collecting such information as
would enable the Department to consider with
the merchants of our country, those questions which
would determine the value of this trade with the
United States.</p>

<p>This cannot be done by a quiet resi-
<catchwords>dence</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90004"/>

dence in Loanda, for the
people, the customs of the natives,
the <sic>vegatation</sic> and the trade
should be made a study at
their homes and at the places 
of supply.</p>

<p>I am aware of the great
amount of labor contained in
in the undertaking of this work,
as well as I am of the danger
which environs it because of
exposure and hostile natives,
but being to an extent familiar
with the general characteristics
of these people, and being more
or less inured to the unhealthy
climate, I have no hesitation in
saying that I feel that I am
fitted to enter into this work with
confidence in my capacity to
bring it to a successful conclusion; 
therefore, I have the
honor to respectfully request
that the Department will
issue such instructions, and 
<catchwords>make</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90005"/>

make such an allowance as will enable
me to proceed with this endeavor.</p>

<p>In seeking this employment
I am influenced by the hope of being
able to make such a report as will
be of value in the eyes of our citizens
interested in commerce, and of
earning for myself the commendation 
of the Department.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
Henry F. Downing<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<pb facs="Scan90006"/>

<p>For<lb/>
Mr. Reves:</p>

<p>Angola is a Portuguese colony and its trade
is monopolized as far as can be by tariffs and discriminating 
duties, by Portugal. North of it lies the Bongo region,
just now being worked by various European governments. 
This suggests to me several <sic>reason</sic> why it
would be like "shearing a hog" to attempt to open up any
trade in that region:</p>

<p>1. The differential duties of Portugal forbid competition</p>

<p>2. The greater distance from Loando to the U.S. places
our shippers at a disadvantage</p>

<p>3. It is impossible to make way against the <unclear>trust</unclear> 
(natural or <unclear extent="one word"/>) of the Germans, who
are seeking to found colonies in that part.</p>

<p>4. Our trade with Angola is nil and I believe consists 
only in some <unclear>rum</unclear>, perhaps a survival
of the slave traffic.</p>

<p>5. No description of the physical character of the
country, or of the productions &amp;c. could be of service 
against such odds. What products we
need are easily procured indirectly through
England, Germany, &amp; Portugal.</p>

<p>6. The entire trade, export and import, of Angola
does not exceed $3,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the

my arrival at Loanda culminated in an aggravated
case of inflammation of the bladder
and in kidney troubles.</p>

<p>Because of being dependent upon
my salary for the support of my family and
myself, I have been compelled to deprive myself
of that clerical assistance which my
condition demanded, and in despite of much 
suffering from pain and weakness from loss of
blood I have persisted in the endeavor to perform
the duties of my office.</p>

<p>This condition has unfortunately

<p>Hon James D. Porter<lb/>

Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose here
with copy of a communication from Mr. Jos.
Clark of the A. B. Missy. Unions at Palabala
Station in the Congo Free State.</p>

<p>This matter has already been brought
under the notice of the Department through
desatch No. 33 under date of Sept 30 1887 and
copy of petition enclosed therein.</p>

<p>By referring to Consular Instructions,
Par. 26 Page 10. I find that by the limitation
of jurisdiction this Consulate is presented,
unless under special instructions from the Department, 
from taking such action as would relieve
these United States citizens from the <unclear extent="one word"/> of which
they complain.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that any 
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90012"/>

of the citizens of our great country should
find theirselves the objects of injustice and
wrong, but her much more room there is
for regret when it is remembered that these
people are not only americans but are exponents 
of principles which should influence
all christendom to aid and protect them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on this coast right
unsupported by power is weak; <sic>indivuals</sic>
and associations thrive or suffer according
to the positions taken by their Governments
in securing to them their rights.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of experience African
residents that for the protection of the citizens
of the United States who are now, or may
become, inhabitants of the Congo Free State,
an agent from our Government should visit
this state at least once a year, and that 
the adoption of such a course would create
a moral influence sufficient to protect
the interests of our citizens.</p>

<p>In view of the Department
deciding to act upon the suggestion contained

December 30 1887.</p>

<p>Hon. George L. Reves,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose
herewith copies and translations of letters
received at this Consulate from the
undermentioned commercial houses 
of this city, Viz: Messrs Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co,
Messrs Baines Larsen &amp; Co.,
Messrs <unclear>Palhares</unclear> and <unclear>Frenares</unclear>
Messrs Souza Lara &amp; Co., and
Messrs <unclear>Sevart</unclear> &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Referring to enclosure No 1,
"Messrs Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co." it seems to me
as being worthy of study, in so far that,
although it bears the signature of the
firm above mentioned, it is an emanation 
of the individual. Mr Newton, who
is a Vice Consul of the United States,
<catchwords>But</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90016"/>

but I fancy to do it justice, it should
be read as coming from a Consular
Office of the British Government, and
an English merchant jealous of opposition.</p>

<p>It appears singular that after the
many years Mr Newton has acted as
U.S. Consul here, that the first merchants
in the place can say "that American
goods are not used because they are
not known," considering this, the fact
that he can see "no inducements for
American merchants &amp;c," many find explanation 
in his method of performing
the duties of U.S. Consul is far as they
relate to the <unclear>extention</unclear> of our foreign
trade.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the inclosure
above referred to, in its  treatment of
the subject under consideration either
does not graph its importance or is
influenced by a desire to discourage
new departures. It seems strange who,
that a successful merchant with
large experience in referring to

<pb facs="Scan90017"/>

causes affecting the commercial growth of a 
nation, should allow his thoughts to be
confined to a question of three or four
years, or that he should limit himself
to the consideration of one product when
commenting upon the resources of a country
so rich in natural agricultural and
manufactured products as ours.</p>

<p>Enclosure No 2: Messrs Baines Larsen &amp; Co.
interested in the growth of commercial relation 
between this province and the U.S. 
adopt a tome that carries with it the
impression of honest expression and considerable 
study. I am unfortunately because
of limited experience, unable to judge
correctly as to the value of their suggestions 
relative to the method to be
adopted to enable American Capital
to get a firm foothold in the part
of Africa, but, as far as knowledge
of the West Coast gives me a right to
judge of here. I think they are in 
some respects, right.</p>

<p>It is worthy of attention
that this firm in referring to cottons
<catchwords>would</catchwords>

<pb facs="Scan90018"/><!-- HERE -->

strengthen their statements by forwarding <unclear></unclear>
showing that if the U.S. desires to place
cotton on this market it will be necessary
for her manufactures to enter into a com=
petition of inferiority, but an examina=
tion of those used in the Northern districts
shows an improvement in quality enclose
"our honesty," allows us to manufacture
These samples with samples of coral
mentioned by this <unclear>firon</unclear> I have forward=
ed to the Department.</p>
<p>Inclosure No. 3- Messrs Pathavest Amares
in contradiction to Messrs Newton Conneq 
tC- though acquainted with only one 
of the products of our country- believe
that the introduction of American
commodities is to be denied.</p>
<p>Inclosure No. 4- Messrs Sonsa Lara
and Cs. have an experience limited
to yellow &amp; pitch pine.</p>
<p>Inclosure No. 5- Messrs Serart &amp; Co,
refer to England and Germany as the
countries of supply for this trade, ignor-
ant of our capacity, they seem to think
that our products are only such as
would</p>

<pb facs="Scan90019"/>

<p>would appeal to the requirements
of the European population, get they
believe, "American goods, may be introduc=
ed with advantage on this market."</p>
<p>Their letters are from of the
first commercial people of Loanda the
longest shippers and imports. It will
be <unclear>mergnized</unclear> that with one exception
they are remarkably unanimous in looking
at things in a narrow way, a comprehens-
ive view of the possibilities of the country
seems to beyond their ability or desire
and to any influence beyond those 
which affect small and immediate
<unclear>prenniary</unclear> returns they are dead.</p>
<p>The great nation of Europe 
find here, and in adjoining districts
valuable outlets for their industries 
taught by experience the value of repre-
sentation there is not a report of com-
mercial value on the coast where
English or German houses have not
planted their need. The factors with
which these countries have excused
these gratifying results, should not 
be</p>

<pb facs="Scan90020"/>

<p>be particular to them but ought to be
common to all alike. Commercial inter=
prise environed by good judgment is their
scent. American industries can find their
way into and seem a safe place in these
centres, if Americans will adopt the
methods as practiced by the English and
Germans. Resident representation coming
for contact with the natives leaning his
needs and securing an intimate knowledge 
of the trade- a supply of much <unclear>andise</unclear>,
steady in its flow and independent of
good and bad seasons alike, duiet
communication, cheap and rapid. Genius
these qualities it would be seen that
in a few years our increasing industries
I would find outlets in many parts of
the world where now the reports of
our country's industries and greatness 
are look upon a almost a romance.</p>
<p>To open the eyes of these people
to the vlue of our goods it is necessary
that some method be adopted to bring
them under their notice. This might
be done by the establishment here,</p>

<pb facs="Scan90021"/>

<p>under the supervision of this Consulate,
of a sample Boom, where could be
displayed- at a <unclear>nominal</unclear> cost- full
lines of our commodities. This enterprise,
preparing a way for future and in=
creasing movements, would receive
valuable assistance from Mssrs Banies,

Your obedient servant.

<p>Henry F. Downing, Esq
United States Consul
Loanda</p>

<p>Sir:
In answer to your letter of the 1st
inst., we beg to reply as follows</p>
<p>We see no inducement for
American merchants to invest in the Angola
trade as there are too many houses already for
the trade and they would have every <unclear>eting</unclear>
against them. They would have no Aniet communic=
caiton and unless their good were shipped through
Lisbon they would have to pay the import duty which
is a difference of 30 %.</p>
<p>We do nothing with Amerian
goods although a few years ago we used ot have this
cargo a year. There is however a considerable quantity
of <unclear></unclear> timber imparted and this year these
<unclear>cangoes</unclear> have come from Pensacola, but now the port
is supplied for some time to come. We have given
up the trade ourselves as we found the <unclear>perfect</unclear>
to be too small to be worth the time and
trouble.</p>
<p>When the Railway is finished
we have not the slightest <unclear>d</unclear> but that
trade will greatly increase but that will take</p>

<pb facs="Scan90023"/>

<p><unclear></unclear> or four years at least. The annexed
import which is terrible, <unclear>avile</unclear>, we think, <unclear>instable</unclear>
of <unclear></unclear> be <unclear>denarde</unclear> as good word in to
<unclear></unclear> in the <unclear>pinterion</unclear></p>
<p>I've <unclear></unclear> really no statistics before
us to offer you but we shall always be happy
at any time, in assisting you to get any infor=
mation you may wish for.</p>
<p>We are sir,

<p>Henry F. Downing Esq.
U.S. Consul
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:
In reply to your official letter asking
us for information relative to local on dets
for American products we have the honor
to inform you that we have made a special
study of this question and have for the
last ear exerted <unclear></unclear> to open up corres-
pondence on the subjct.</p>
<p>Doubtless you have consulted other
firms in our city and have become familiar
with the local idea that American 
products are limited to Lumber and
Petroleum.</p>
<p>We take it that you wish to have
a plain statement on our side of what
can be done and how to do it. The
matter is however a very complex one
and must be treated at length- for
our ground extends not only to this might for-
hood but to the North Coast and the
Congo River.</p>

<pb facs="Scan90026"/>

<p>Angola- Loanda-
Here very little has come in beyond Petroleum, lumber
and seasoned lets of <unclear>flirer</unclear> and soap.</p>
<p>Petroleum.- The consumption in Loanda: about 30 cases
of 10 gas each, few <unclear></unclear>= goo cases per month.
Now Redonds, Benguela, Missamedes, S. Home
and Banana: probably 2500 cases per month.
Donds and hte other lives and interior towns
another 16 or = 5000 cases of 10 gals. ea. per
month for this province. To resource a monopoly
of this trade it would be necessary to crush
competition, and to do this the aster ff would
have to be part <unclear>cif</unclear> in most of the ports men=
tioned @ this firles 1 $250. In Banana and
Cabinda better price resde. In Cabinda on
contrast with the Government is for <unclear>Rris</unclear> 1 $960
fun case. Custom duties in all entrese ports except
Banana and Cabinda, which are frce= 20
this per kilo.</p>
<p>Lumber- These are now five Loanda forms selling lumber
and we are awaiting a consignment from Norway.
Acassional lots, say 4 as time, would sell in 
about 3 months @ an average of <unclear></unclear> 25 $ or
per 1000 ft. new. If you wish we will
you preforms apeals. The duty is 110% ad. me
their of lumber 5"sq yellow pine logo, mtch

might do well North but have no sale in</p>

<pb facs="Scan90027"/>

<p>Loanda
The one thing necessary for Angola trade
 is to just "somthing called soap"- hard, and
dark in color-- on this market at a maximum
of Reis 3 $oro per 55 cif Loanda con=
smption about 200 cases per month.</p>
<p>Flour.-- Fair quality such as that offered @ $3.50
to $4.00 in America should be put here cit
at $6.50 to $9.00. It sills well at about $8.00
in the customs- home. The comissomption in
Loanda and interior towns arrange 500 
barrels monthly. By taking in the other
Angola, and the Congo ports the quantity
might be trebled.</p>
<p>Butter.- Not good business in Loanda where
Normandy butter is preferred. It <unclear>bruwen</unclear>
sells well North. selling price 450 <unclear>reis</unclear> per
lb: duty 20%.</p>
<p>Hams- In small lots home regular sales through
out- same price and duties as butter.</p>
<p>Paints &amp; Oils.- Are of importance in ruin of the sanons
Government contracts. Red lead (powder) in
kegs should arrive cif @ 131 to 19/- per 00
kilo as a <unclear>maximum</unclear> others in proportion
<unclear>tempentime</unclear> and Raw Linaied oil at 5t

chains, <unclear>wardrot</unclear> and cheffonicers, writing
tables (plain with two to four drawers), stools,
folding hatracks, commode, tc.tc.tc. sell well
if cheap. For <unclear></unclear> for instances as a fasis a
"showy" 5 pt. wardrobe @ from $35.00 to $40.00, 
(without mirror).</p>
<p>Soft Goods.- Table cloths and napkins; hand kerchiefs;
have regular sales at low price-duties line
700 reis per kilo cotton 500 reis.</p>
<p>Tea- Of fair quality (black and green) sells @
800 to 900 reis per lb- duty 240 reis per $.</p>
<p>Cheese- Regular sales in small lots. selling @
400 to 450 reis lbs- duty 20%.</p>
<p>Canned Goods.- American canned goods are not known.
Canned beef put up by the "Arman Co" is
however much favored @ 500 reis per 2 lbs
tin.</p>
<p>Lard- Good business in regular lots sells @ 220
reis per lb- Duty 20%.</p>
<p>Matches.- Cannot compete with the Germans.</p>
<p>Cod fish If every dry has large sale. It would
be advisable to experiment with <unclear>Nenfom dland</unclear></p>
<p>Cotton Goods. So far as this province aprart from

products, and that is American honesty.

<p>The foregoing remark will serve to give you some
idea of the prospects offered in this province proper- Sir
views of the future, however, we have to consider the protable
commercial changes resultant upon the completion of the
Loanda and Amboa Railway.</p>
<p>The Railway <unclear>Selesie</unclear>,
evan originally formulated with the idea of opening
up the Lineage gold fields to the North of Golungo Alto.
Its value, however does not depend upon any speculative
enterprise but upon the natural resources of the <unclear>pernice</unclear>
The fertile dishists of Congo. Galingo alto. Engage tc.
producing coffee, <unclear>ribbon</unclear>, palm oil, <unclear></unclear> kennals tc. in great
abundance are practically coffed of their value by
the difficulties of transport.</p>
<p>At times carriers are not to be had to
the <unclear></unclear> ports, but were these no difficulty in this repeat
the excessive rates of the <unclear>companlia</unclear> da <unclear></unclear> 
would be sufficient to heavily handicap any enterprise.</p>
<p>We will give you the figures, <unclear>previewing</unclear> that
the produce is practically unlimited; given proper--
merchandise and copied transport the trade of
Angola would assume an importance it has never
yet <unclear>posscoed</unclear>. From Engone to Gonda- 5 days primary
Each carrier will take kilos of coffee, price per
carrier per trip  4 $000 ries. Therefore each ton of</p>

<pb facs="Scan90031"/>

<p>coffee requires 1/2 carriers and exists from Engone 
to Donda 58$ 000 less From Donda to Loanda
by the <unclear>Luanga</unclear> River Steams the fright is 40
ries per ton per kilametre- Donda is 200 kilametres
from Loanda, Ex. 200 x40= 5000 Reis x 50 100=66
about $70.00 per ton over 124 miles. The natural
emergence is that the interior plantations are
continually losing money and are all <unclear></unclear>=
to the Bank. Here gain we have the
secret of the falsified goods. Now all this
the Railway will remedy by tapping the <unclear>leayngo</unclear>
Galungo and Encange districts, malbing us to
mend our goods up cheaply and rapidly and get
our produce down <unclear>pender</unclear> equally advantage
circumstances.</p>
<p>The Railway will be built and will pay
well. It is however, at present in dubirus hands.
If things go wrong it may be five years before
the times franses Ouia: if not three years will
enable it to at least mitigate the into we have
mentioned.</p>
<p>The any the line will be built because
if the company fails in its obligation <unclear></unclear>
of African merchants is prepared to come forward
and <unclear></unclear> the thing through.</p>
<p>-District of the Congo-</p>
<p>We would rather not go into detail as to the River
Congo itself as we are of opinion that any <unclear>statement</unclear></p>

<pb facs="Scan90032"/>

<p>would fall short of the reality. we have,
however, powerful friend them, and if me could
go on a comprehensive visit try other much single
be arranged.</p>
<p>Outside of the Congo itself but within its
district we have outlets at Landana, Cabinda
and Ambrizette- not to mention S. <unclear></unclear> on the
Congo.- These places we supply under Government
Contracts with all kinds of promissions tc. tc.</p>
<p>In this district trade is essentially differ-
ent to that of Angola proper- goods are only partial=
ly adultenated and falsified and these is yet
a good field for American Cottons of the lowest
quality. In Cabinda alone we can guarantee
150 tons of produce per month and with a few
more homes in the <unclear></unclear> river we <unclear></unclear> doubt
that it could be quadrupled as merchants 
that it could sell you about 100 tons per month- <unclear></unclear>
@ 400 reis per 52$- not to mention aplended hand
woods in any quantity.</p>
<p>Such produce is all bought in barter for=
Cotton as per samples- <unclear></unclear> 40" under x 24 400 + <unclear></unclear>

advise later. Products are <unclear></unclear>, palm oil,
Rubber and ground nuts, <unclear></unclear> think <unclear></unclear> that
a little pusihng might arrange for a fiar
quantity of ivory.</p>
<p>Estimated capital for this enterprise
or for a concerns establishing and stocking
ten (10) factories= $60.000 No American
labor required not timber construction.</p>
<p>In conclusion we are of opinion that for 
American to be a drantageously represented in
Africa it is necessary that:-</p>
<p>A company be formed in American with at least
$200.000 Capital.</p>
<p>That an energetic and pushing <unclear></unclear> be
appointed a African Manager with a "good
interest"- acting under supervision.</p>
<p>That the company own at least 4 sailing
vessels of from $50 to 400 tons trader and
that these seem regularly between the two
countries: <unclear></unclear> the way for steam
communication.</p>
<p>Given <unclear></unclear> conditions it is easy for
American products to obtain a form fasting</p>

<pb facs="Scan90034"/>

<p>in African and for America to <unclear></unclear> that
position as regards African which a one of the
most important nation of the world she has
only exert himself to command.</p>
<p>We would also call your attention to the
fact that there are some hundreds of <unclear></unclear> register-
ed in the Secretarial of this town: including
gold, coal, petroleum, copper, and other valuable
minerals. In Cabinda we have copper, lead
and <unclear></unclear> in great profusion, and were informed
by the Government sometime since that time exerts
every indication of coal.</p>

to your various question.</p>

altho' of great importance in death, has only
manifested itself on a very small <unclear></unclear> in our

Steamer from Fishon, he is accompanied by his

Coast. A railroad is much needed, and a

obtained by any American Company <unclear>selling</unclear>
to <unclear></unclear> some Capital; The country is very
rich but has no developments, In all the

that a nature so well know would still
keep what sguandrons in countries and
ports where there was no need of such
and that in his belief on am: man of
war was needed at least twice a year
on this coast. his Excellency Ideas on this
matter is supported by every one I Imaw,
and in my conversation with several
natives chiefs and trades on this coast
I have been told the following.</p>
<p>"You call yourself a representative of a great
country were all kinds of goods abound,
but where are they? You say that your
nation is greater and larger then
Holland, France, England, how can
you prove it to us; the English have

I have the honor to state that by report secured from the

J.B. Bolten were at that port during the month of
October also that the milton ran on shore <unclear>hsoirce,</unclear> but
got off alright. Mossamedes was infected also with
small pox. The report from Benguela is only
inentionning that several of the Am: <unclear>missrioranis</unclear>
from <unclear>Balinbu</unclear> were at Bengela buying some goods
to Barter in the interior. The consul agent as
Ambry informs me of the arrival of Mr. Baxter

reason of ill health, heside writting the following <unclear></unclear>
"Am: trading vessels may be said to have ceased
ruming to this part of the coast altogether with
their usual cargo such as lumber, tobacco, cam
Far jaja. But there is another important hanch
of our trade, and I have no doubt whatever
if the matter is properly locked into, it
might eventually lead to the opening.</p>

<p>up of an extensive commerce.</p>
<p>I mean the manufacture of common ordinary cloths

did compete successfully with Manchester; actually
exporting Am: made greys to Manchester for sale!
I am at a loss to know why this was never <unclear>encausing</unclear>
unless the Manchester new cut their prices of me
that it discouraged the American manufactures
from preserving. Should you deem my idea
of any value, I shall be glad to forsaid you

<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge the recipt of
your dispatch No. 10, in regard to Agents appointed
by me would <unclear>appnored</unclear> by the Hon: Secty. of State;
it was and still is with the intention of promoting
Am: Commerce in this part of the world, beside
putting a stp to runaway seaman, for abuse
received on board Am: <unclear>Whloers</unclear>: and while
enforcing the U.S. Law over this jurisdiction, to 
give prompt justice to seamen, masters or officers.</p>
<p>"Mossamedes" will in a few years become important
large fields of wheat, corn, sugar cane, and
cotton are now in cultivation.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Govt. is organizing small colonies
all over that district, The Buiers in "Whillah"
and "Humpata" on cutting <unclear>confornitly</unclear> with
the Portuguese a route from the interior; so
that this crops, and the result of their hunting,
such as, Hides, ivory, &amp; ostrich feathers, can
be carried to Mossamedes; These colonies
as well as the Buiers;- and even the natures
of the interior who seem to fallow now the</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0157.003"/>

<p>example of the Boers- will soon want
farming implements; and I do not
know of any to be compared with those
of the U.S. for simplicity, <unclear>denability</unclear> and
cheapness.__ The merchants and large
land builders will ne also steam
wills, and other machinery for making
Rum, Sugar, grinding corn and wheat,
cleaning and pressing cotton ja.ja.</p>
<p>A,: Whalers seem to make their head quarters
now at not place, "although the best inducements
have been granted to them by the Portuguese govt.
at Loanda.</p>
<p>I understand what nine whalers were
there during the last two months. From the
"Eliza Adams" three seamen ran away, and
from the "Alice Knowles" a man was discharged
by reason of sickness; these seamen have
been sent to me from Mossamedes at a
great expense, and I find myself compelled
to keep them until I am able to foward
them to Santeago "Cape de Verde" by mail steamer
which only takes them occasionally, more
as a <unclear>javor</unclear> although I pay to the Capt
5.0.0 for each man.</p>
<p>M.J.L. Iovies that I appointed until
appnored by the Hon: Secty. of State is the
largest merchant of Mossamedes, a young</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0157.004"/>

<p>Man, full of energy, and ambitions to
promote the commerce and development
of Mossamedes.</p>
<p>It is upon close inquiryk as to his
capacity, integrity capabilityja.ja. that
I appointed him. If the state Dept has
any objections to these appointments, I
will notify them at  once as not having
been accepted by the state Dept.</p>
<p>I have never seen either of the gentlemen
at Amby, Benguella, Mossamedes;
but I am confident that an agent is
needed at Mossamedes for the interest
of Am: Seamen and others visiting that
port</p>

mentioning that  severals of the Am: Missiourians

Amby informs me of the arrival of Mr. Baxton

of our trade, and I have no doubt whatever
if the matter is properly looked into it

<p>I mean the manufacture of common ordinary clots
suitable for this trade, such as greys and stripped</p>
<p>Domestics, why cannot the American Mills
compete with the Manchester, and not the cotton
ready to their hands. Some fear years ago, they
did compete successfully with Manchester; actually
exporting Am: made greys to Manchester for sale!</p>
<p>I am at a loss to know why this was never encouraged
unless; the Manchester new cut their price of one
that it discouraged the American manufactures
from persevering. Should you deem my idea
of any value. I shall be glad to forward your
samples of goods indicated, and would feel
desirous of knowing at what price, in English
currency they could be delivered to Liverpool for

<p>Hon: W. Hunter

Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
your dispatch No.10 in regard to Agents appointed
by me could <unclear>apnored</unclear> by the Hon: Secty. of State;
it was and still is this part of the would, beside
putting a stap to run away seamen, for abuse
received on board Am: Whalers: and while
enforcing the U.S. Law over this Jurisdiction, to
give prompt justice to seamen, masters or <unclear></unclear>.
"Mossamedes" will in a few years become importence
large fields of wheat, corn, sugar cane, and
cotton are now in cultivation.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Govt. is organizing small colonies
all over that district, The <unclear>Bvirs</unclear> in "whillah"
and "Humpata" are cutting <unclear>conforntly</unclear> with
the Portuguese a route from the interior; so
that this crops; and the result of their <unclear></unclear>,
such as Hides, Ivory, and Ostrich Feathers, can
be carried to Mossamedes. These Colonies
as well as the Baers;- And even the natures
of the interior who seem to follow now the</p>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0164.002"/>

<p>Example of the Baers- well soon want
Farming implements; and I do not
know of any to be compared with those
of the U.S. for simplicity, denability and 
cheapness. The merchants and large
and bolders will need also steam
Mills, and ther machinery for making
Rum, sugar, grinding corn and wheat,
cleanning and pressing-- Cotton S.S.</p>
<p>I understand that nine Whalers were
there during the last two months. From the
"Eliza Adams" three seamen run away, and
from the "Alice Knowles" a man was discharged,
by reason of sickness; these seamen have
been sent to me from Mossamedes at a
great expense, and I find myself compelled
to keep them until I am able to foward
them to Santeago "Cape de Verde" by mail steamers.
Which only takes them occasionally, more
as a favor, although I pay to the Capt.
5.0.0. for each man.</p>
<p>No J.L. Jones that I appointed until
<unclear>appnored</unclear> by the Hon: Secty. of State is the
largest merchant of Mossamedes, A Young</p>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0164.003"/>

<p>Man, full of energy, and ambitions to 
promote the commerce and development
of Mossamedes.</p>
<p>It is only upon close inquiry, as to his
Capacity, integrety, Capability S.S. that
I appointed him. If the State Dept. has
any objects to these appointments, I
will notify them at once as not having
been accepted by the state Dept.</p>
<p>I have never seen either of the gentlemen
at Ambry, Benguella S. Mossamedes;
but I am confident that an agent is
needed at Mossamedes for the interest
of Am: Commerce and <unclear>protecteoir</unclear> of
Am: Seamen and others visiting that 
port.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
Sir
