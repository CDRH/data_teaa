"Mossamedes" on Lile-Fish Bay 
October 18th 1882</p>
<p>I swam on shore and deserted the
distance from the ship to the shore
was about 1 3/4 miles. The cause of
my running away from the vessel
was brutal treatment from the 
3rd mats the Joe <unclear>Linish</unclear> he being
encouraged by the other officers
and Capt. ordering him to have me
we beaten. I served six months
on said vessel and found it impossible
to hear the abuse any longer.

bushes until the vessel left
port, and when I went to report 
myself to the Consular Agent</p>

received on board for six months
was more than man could hear;
I am here to  bare footed having

under oath, that I have been on
board of said Alice Knowles for
about 3 1/2 years, during which time
I only received from the master
the sum of $36 00/100 n ach, that I 
never refused duty while on board 
and was sent on shore at Lile-Fish
Bay on "Mossamedes" by the Capt
on account of sickness. While on
shore here the Consular Agent
took good care of me <unclear>rentone</unclear>

Portuguese Steamer left for Loanda,
and  that the Consular Agent

to the owner of New Bedford.</p>
<p>The agreement mile-the master was

a barrel full for every go on
land. From the slop chest I received
only $15.25. I was laid up 3 1/2
weeks sick on shore at Mossamedes
waiting the arrival of the Portuguese 
mail Steam ship for this port.</p>
<p>I never signed or put any mark 
to any kind of paper or document;

receive on my arrival at New Bedford
$9.00 for my shore, which I think is 
specified in the letter he gave me

I have the regret to state that the named

hours.</p>
<p>I also was decently buried by this consulate
in the English or Protestant Cemetery, not
having been aft to more than he was
a Catholic, which is my forny believe he was
being of Portuguese origin; the remainder
of his flothing not intened with him
consisted of one waleu blanket, one
pu and one overhaul my burned

St. Paul de Loauda 
Jany. 10th 1883</p>

<p>Hon: John Davis
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
Having been compelled to change air by season
of continued sickness, I made a letter ship up
the Luanga river as far as Douda which took
me 9 days.</p>
<p>The Luanga river form the South-eastern
boundary of the Portuguese <unclear></unclear> of Angola
although it is claimed by them to possess
the whole country from Latt. South 5 to 
Latt South 19. The source of the Laurga is
unknown as yet.</p>
<p>From Donda to the Bar, is the great
Commercial highway of Angola, but
only navigable for small crafts, the
control of said River by steam navigation
was obtained by the late Mr. Silva the U.S.
commercial agent,and has been kept
here since <unclear>wilder</unclear> the name of "Luanga 
Steam Navigation" That grant will
expire shortly and leave open, to some
enterprising American a gold field 
of <unclear></unclear> value. </p>

<pb facs="Scan10020.jpg"/>

<p>Trade of all sorts is very brisk at the 
different factories on the right bank of
the river, the left on eing still in the
hands of the naturies, who will allow us
<unclear></unclear> to settle there: Au exception is
the small fortress and few Catholic channels
now almost in ruin of Muscina, held
by the Portuguese; but no trade comes to that place.</p>
<p>Donda may be called the heart or capital
of the interior of the Provence of Angola, 
to Dons, the Portuguese traders and
planters of Cafengo, Golimgo-Alto, Ambaca
Pungo-Andongo, and Malango seud
they coffee, <unclear>wang</unclear> Rubber, <unclear>Lrary S.S.S.</unclear>
to the shipped to Loanda</p>
<p>It is to Dondo only that the natires
from the right bank of the Luanga bring
their gindula, palm oil, hides ursella
S.S.S., to be bartered for cloth, powder, 
arms, rum, and <unclear>guincailleries</unclear>.</p>
<p>The two seasons, are as follows; the winter
begins from June to the middle of October
and summer from middle of October
to the beginning of June.</p>
<p>In winter also called "the dry season"
there is no rain, but heavy dense during
the night, and with the sun generally</p>

<pb facs="Scan10021.jpg"/>

<p>covered by clouds until 9, 10, and 11 a.m.
the temperature is agreeable, the thermometer
seldom rising above 23 : in the shade;
the summer or rainy season, is more properly
divided into two season: :the small rans
and the big rains" on the 18th of October when
we part the sun in our length, small
showers begin to fall in the afternoon until
the 22d. of December when the sun attains
its greatest southern declination, from
that date until the 24th of February, when we
again have the sun in any length, the 
weather remains changeable, while in March
and April the rains come down in
torrents of sometimes twelve and sixteen
hours duration, inundating the country
and swelling the rivers.</p>
<p>The banks in the river as well as the bar
shifts yearly after the raining season is over
owing to the strong current occasioned
by the heavy rain. During the dray season
offoo tede is felt as far as Bom Jesus
while in the rainy seasons a current
runs constantly down with a velocity 
of from 4 1/2 knots at Dando, and
1 1/2 knots at the Bar.</p>
<p>The climate on the banks of the river is 
<unclear></unclear> healthy, fever and liver complaints</p>

<pb facs="Scan10022.jpg"/>

<p>being the prevailing diseases especially in the 
raining months. The Laundaries full of fish,
alligators and hippopatami; when the river has
overflowed its banks and <unclear>susides</unclear> again ino
its awashed, the effuria from the <unclear></unclear> becoming
very dangerous to <unclear></unclear> as well as tto the
waters caustifatious </p>
<p>It is remarkable that the natures suffer as
more from seven <unclear>thew</unclear> the Europeans, by reason
I henese of their mode of living, which is
entirely on farmiha, and Lula, and paisace
themselves with the vile shift called rum, on trade
<unclear>qui</unclear> importd by European trades.</p>
<p>In Calengo, Penigo-Audorego, Golingo-allo and
Ambaca, feres are almost unknown, while the 
climate of :Malenge" is almost European, whear
gearing, and being cultivated rain with great 
success.--</p>
<p>Two years ago a terrible epidemic of small pox
decimated the nature populatoire, while not a
single European was attacked by it--
In case of sickness a nature generally distrusts
European treatment and medicines, but prefers
to be slonly doctored to death by his own country-
men and superstitious</p>
<p>When dead the common negro is buried
anywhere, maybe, a few yards from the door 
of his cabata, or in the middle of the road</p>

<pb facs="Scan10023.jpg"/>

<p><unclear>this</unclear> or nature chiefs, are <unclear>intoed</unclear> with more ceremony.
For three months the couple is kept ashore the grained
sitting in a chair, and daily enveloped in new
pieces of cloths, which are robbed during the
night by his former subjects After this lapse
of time, he is deposited in his gare two
grown up <unclear>slares hemo</unclear> decapitated and their
bodies entered with him, as well as a 
boy and a girl "both alive" the former holding
the Jaba's here and the other a <unclear></unclear> with
water; Although it have never been an eye
witness of this barbarism, and thought it
is officially contradicted, I do form by
believe that it is still practiced, and
would have gone with my informant to
one of these Burials; if I had been well
and had time to spare-</p>
<p>Another barbarism, not yet abolished
is judgment by fetish: which I have
witnessed more than fifty times on the
Well J.S. West Coast previous to the present 
rig: The accused, to show his innocence
deliberately swallows a certain amount
of deadly <unclear>regetatle</unclear> poison, if he vomits
it, he is innocent! but if his stomach
retains it he is guilty of the crime 
imputed to him, and dies--</p>
<p>When a Jaba dies, his successor is not

<pb facs="Scan10024.jpg"/>

allowed to continue the works which the deceased
may have begun, or to inhabit his residence, nor
does he inherit his fortune, plate or anything
on the county, where emmorable good,
Hauses J. belonging to the deceased, are allowed
to fall into <unclear>reim</unclear> while all morable goods
are robbed by his subject immediately after
death.' For a whole year the limit of the 
deceased is supposed to reign, his
successor having no power whatever, the
whole king down or the remaind, therefore,
in a state of anarchy.</p>
<p>The antignated custom impedes to a great
extent the prosperity of the nature <unclear></unclear>
as whatever are regent may have done
for his people, this successor is obliged to 
annihilate.</p>
<p>to Doudo, th most important places
on the Lauanga are "Massangano" (fortous trade and 
Cane plantattions on the Lucala.) "Boca de 
Gyarga" (trade principaly palm oil <unclear>fihe</unclear>and
live stock) "Coffeecaulba" (trade prinicaplly 
coffee, palm oil and rock jaln.) "Cumga" (trade
principally cotton and <unclear>fihe</unclear> "Bom Jesus" Laange

<p>I have the honor to state that by the British
mail S.S Bosmy which arrived on the 11th
hint I new a young boy and a girl all
from Dons, and who accompanied the
German explores Luist Weissmann in
craddling Africa have Londa; have returned
in good health, they report that their 
voyage across was very pleasant, and
that they never had nay troubles with
the natives of the interior-that aco
the chiefs recovered very well; although
they had no prospects to give them--
and that from tribe to tribe they
were accompanied by some chiefs. They
went to Laugilar where they were put
on board the British S.S. Chittagong
with about 250 more landibariaus
under the command of a Belgian
called Capt. Combier, for Mr. Henry 
Mr. Stanley expedition and more 
landed at Banana on the Congo.</p>

<p>and proceeded at once to Mr. Henry M.
Stanley Head quarter.</p>
<p>The British mail S.S. Bormy brought
Mr. Weissman followers here.</p>
<p>The strong impression here is: that a great 
disturbance is expected on the upper
Congo very soon.</p>
