<p>Sir
I have the regret to state that the named
"Augustus Jason" as <unclear>levorsed</unclear> by him <unclear>whe's</unclear>
offidrck 19 years of age born in New Bedford
Mass. died on board the Portuguese Brig
Boardor on the 2nt January of Penniclous
or pestilant fever after an illness of 14
hours.</p>
<p>I also was decently buried by this consulate
in the English or Protestant Cemetery, not
having been aft to more than he was
a Catholic, which is my forny believe he was
being of Portuguese origin; the remainder
of his flothing not intened with him
consisted of one waleu blanket, one
pu and one overhaul my burned 
according to the customs of this locality
for such contagious deseases.</p>
<p>The other the seamen David Miller and
Charles Lewis, would have certainly died
here if I had not had the opportunity
to there by Jared vessel____ as to</p>

<p>very Williams, he is the at the hospital,
you feel very hard to have him accepted on

St. Paul de Loauda 
Jany. 10th 1883</p>

<p>Hon: John Davis
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
Having been compelled to change air by season
of continued sickness, I made a letter ship up
the Luanga river as far as Douda which took
me 9 days.</p>
<p>The Luanga river form the South-eastern
boundary of the Portuguese <unclear></unclear> of Angola
although it is claimed by them to possess
the whole country from Latt. South 5 to 
Latt South 19. The source of the Laurga is
unknown as yet.</p>
<p>From Donda to the Bar, is the great
Commercial highway of Angola, but
only navigable for small crafts, the
control of said River by steam navigation
was obtained by the late Mr. Silva the U.S.
commercial agent,and has been kept
here since <unclear>wilder</unclear> the name of "Luanga 
Steam Navigation" That grant will
expire shortly and leave open, to some
enterprising American a gold field 
of <unclear></unclear> value. </p>

<pb facs="Scan10020.jpg"/>

<p>Trade of all sorts is very brisk at the 
different factories on the right bank of
the river, the left on eing still in the
hands of the naturies, who will allow us
<unclear></unclear> to settle there: Au exception is
the small fortress and few Catholic channels
now almost in ruin of Muscina, held
by the Portuguese; but no trade comes to that place.</p>
<p>Donda may be called the heart or capital
of the interior of the Provence of Angola, 
to Dons, the Portuguese traders and
planters of Cafengo, Golimgo-Alto, Ambaca
Pungo-Andongo, and Malango seud
they coffee, <unclear>wang</unclear> Rubber, <unclear>Lrary S.S.S.</unclear>
to the shipped to Loanda</p>
<p>It is to Dondo only that the natires
from the right bank of the Luanga bring
their gindula, palm oil, hides ursella
S.S.S., to be bartered for cloth, powder, 
arms, rum, and <unclear>guincailleries</unclear>.</p>
<p>The two seasons, are as follows; the winter
begins from June to the middle of October
and summer from middle of October
to the beginning of June.</p>
<p>In winter also called "the dry season"
there is no rain, but heavy dense during
the night, and with the sun generally</p>

<pb facs="Scan10021.jpg"/>

<p>covered by clouds until 9, 10, and 11 a.m.
the temperature is agreeable, the thermometer
seldom rising above 23 : in the shade;
the summer or rainy season, is more properly
divided into two season: :the small rans
and the big rains" on the 18th of October when
we part the sun in our length, small
showers begin to fall in the afternoon until
the 22d. of December when the sun attains
its greatest southern declination, from
that date until the 24th of February, when we
again have the sun in any length, the 
weather remains changeable, while in March
and April the rains come down in
torrents of sometimes twelve and sixteen
hours duration, inundating the country
and swelling the rivers.</p>
<p>The banks in the river as well as the bar
shifts yearly after the raining season is over
owing to the strong current occasioned
by the heavy rain. During the dray season
offoo tede is felt as far as Bom Jesus
while in the rainy seasons a current
runs constantly down with a velocity 
of from 4 1/2 knots at Dando, and
1 1/2 knots at the Bar.</p>
<p>The climate on the banks of the river is 
<unclear></unclear> healthy, fever and liver complaints</p>

<pb facs="Scan10022.jpg"/>

<p>being the prevailing diseases especially in the 
raining months. The Laundaries full of fish,
alligators and hippopatami; when the river has
overflowed its banks and <unclear>susides</unclear> again ino
its awashed, the effuria from the <unclear></unclear> becoming
very dangerous to <unclear></unclear> as well as tto the
waters caustifatious </p>
<p>It is remarkable that the natures suffer as
more from seven <unclear>thew</unclear> the Europeans, by reason
I henese of their mode of living, which is
entirely on farmiha, and Lula, and paisace
themselves with the vile shift called rum, on trade
<unclear>qui</unclear> importd by European trades.</p>
<p>In Calengo, Penigo-Audorego, Golingo-allo and
Ambaca, feres are almost unknown, while the 
climate of :Malenge" is almost European, whear
gearing, and being cultivated rain with great 
success.--</p>
<p>Two years ago a terrible epidemic of small pox
decimated the nature populatoire, while not a
single European was attacked by it--
In case of sickness a nature generally distrusts
European treatment and medicines, but prefers
to be slonly doctored to death by his own country-
men and superstitious</p>

anywhere, maybe, a few yards from the door 
of his cabata, or in the middle of the road</p>

For three months the couple is kept ashore the grained
sitting in a chair, and daily enveloped in new
pieces of cloths, which are robbed during the
night by his former subjects After this lapse
of time, he is deposited in his gare two
grown up <unclear>slares hemo</unclear> decapitated and their
bodies entered with him, as well as a 
boy and a girl "both alive" the former holding

witness of this barbarism, and thought it
is officially contradicted, I do form by
believe that it is still practiced, and
would have gone with my informant to

and had time to spare-</p>
<p>Another barbarism, not yet abolished
is judgment by fetish: which I have
witnessed more than fifty times on the
Well J.S. West Coast previous to the present 
rig: The accused, to show his innocence
deliberately swallows a certain amount
of deadly <unclear>regetatle</unclear> poison, if he vomits
it, he is innocent! but if his stomach
retains it he is guilty of the crime 
imputed to him, and dies--</p>
<p>When a Jaba dies, his successor is not

allowed to continue the works which the deceased
may have begun, or to inhabit his residence, nor
does he inherit his fortune, plate or anything
on the county, where emmorable good,
Hauses J. belonging to the deceased, are allowed
to fall into <unclear>reim</unclear> while all morable goods
are robbed by his subject immediately after
death.' For a whole year the limit of the 
deceased is supposed to reign, his
successor having no power whatever, the
whole king down or the remaind, therefore,
in a state of anarchy.</p>
<p>The antignated custom impedes to a great
extent the prosperity of the nature <unclear></unclear>
as whatever are regent may have done
for his people, this successor is obliged to 
annihilate.</p>

<p>I have the honor to state that by the British
mail S.S Bosmy which arrived on the 11th
hint I new a young boy and a girl all
from Dons, and who accompanied the
German explores Luist Weissmann in
craddling Africa have Loanda; have returned
in good health, they report that their 
voyage across was very pleasant, and
that they never had nay troubles with
the natives of the interior-that aco
the chiefs recovered very well; although
they had no prospects to give them--
and that from tribe to tribe they
were accompanied by some chiefs. They
went to Laugilar where they were put
on board the British S.S. Chittagong
with about 250 more landibariaus
under the command of a Belgian
called Capt. Combier, for Mr. Henry 
Mr. Stanley expedition and more 
landed at Banana on the Congo.</p>

<pb facs="Scan10028.jpg"/>

<p>and proceeded at once to Mr. Henry M.
Stanley Head quarter.</p>
<p>The British mail S.S. Bosmy brought
Mr. Weissman followers here.</p>
<p>The strong impression here is: that a great 
disturbance is expected on the upper
Congo very soon.</p>

themselves <unclear>betureeu</unclear> Gaboon and anbryette

are also established since their arrival 
here--</p>

the interior, the <unclear>Liory</unclear> and others produce
have been keep back, and fright on the
coast very hard to be obtained for the
present which leave some of the large
commuist merchants in a very bad
state and I am expecting daily to
hear of some failured in Loanda.</p>

Assistant Secretary of State 
Washinton D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to state that
Dispatch M: 12 is received and contents
carefully noted, for which I thank the 
Department.</p>
<p>I have been following a real slave
business going on here and carried
out by Portuguese from Lisbon and 
both whites and <unclear>innlattos</unclear> of this 
country. I wanted and still
intend to follow them on that business
up to the near interior where the 
purchase is effected by Barter, <unclear></unclear>
as is the case, I am told, throughout
almost all the trading posts, not
only of the interior but near the sea-
board and rivers: Such is the case
at the most important tour of
Danda on the Luanza never: Ambrig
and

<pb facs="Scan10039.jpg"/>

and specially at the southern
ports of Benguella and Catumbellla
where large <unclear>casarans</unclear> of two and
three thousand Negros are constantly
arriving from the interior bringing
along with their produce numbers
of young blacks for sale or barter; 
they average in ages from infancy 
to full grown adults, and always
find a ready market with trick
competition.</p>
<p>From the small seaport of clovo=
Redondo South of Loanda, an export
trade has been regularly carried
on for more than five years by
the agents and on account of the 
Bank Alltramarine of Lisbon. The
agent form this port is a cll.
Batrices Alvares, and although cer-
tain formed are caused out as pres-
cribed by their emigration land,
it is well known that as soon
as they are landed at St. Thomas,-
and that by the hundreds-they
are treated, conducted and consi-
dered

<pb facs="Scan10040.jpg"/>

dered as slaves; and not one
has ever been known to have re-
turned, and most probably never
will be.</p>
<p>But I have been now for a 
long time very sick, and this
month hardly able to write, even-
tully wife Mrs. du Verge has lift
for the United States via Liverpool:
she has with her a live specimen
of slave traffic in Africa; a stolen

<p>To the Commander of the French War and
To anchor in Loango</p>
<p>Sir,
Having heard from <unclear></unclear> whitemen, that you
had, or overe going to take possession of this county, in the name
of the French Government, and having heard also that the nations
in that case would out of revenge, attack, plunder, and destroy
the several trading house in the place, and after words take to the
bash, I undersigned a citizen of the United States of North America
doing business in this pace, and in other pints near here, having Amer-
ican and British properly incharge, find myself obliged to adress
you the following consideration.</p>
<p>That it is almost certain that as soon as the Natives find
out that you are taking possession of their country, they will out of
revenge, attack factories, and plunder and destroy everything. Thus
entailing ruin on innocent traders, who have nothing whatever to do
with these questions.</p>
<p>The presence of your vessel willn ot deter them from 
so doing, as they will very likely make a right attack, and by make
it general preclude the possibility of the white men helping each 
other.</p>
<p>That as soon as they have plundered and destroyed the
Factories, killing very likely also some of the white men, they will
take ot the Bush, as the <unclear>lors</unclear> of their villages is as nothing to them, making
it impossible to find and punish them.</p>
<p>Considering the Circumstances, the Undersigned
thinks it incumbent to him, as a citizen of the United States

<pb facs="Scan20001.jpg"/>

of American, as proprictor and Agent, having American and British
property in charge, to formally protect against you and the
Fred. Government individually and collectively, for any loss or
damage that may accrul to him. Through any, through any 
acts caused by yours or by the French Government orders,
including additional experiences and loss of time or any other damage
direct or indirect.</p>
<p>Hoping that you will take due notice
of this my formal protest, (a copy of which will be fon-
ded to the American Consuls at Gabon and Loanda)
and that you will kindly send me an acknowledgement
of his receipt, I remain with the greatest consideration.</p>
<p>Most Respectly, 
Your Obedt Serant

<p>St. Paul de Loanda 
14 June 1883
the Assistant Secretary of State.
Washington. }</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honour to lay 
before the Department of State the 
following circumstances connected
with the discharge of my duties as 
Vice Consul for the United States at
this port.</p>
<p>Mr. L de R du Verge left
Loanda for the Congo on the 16th
<unclear>ultins</unclear> by the Portuguese mail steamer
for the purpose it is reported, of
ammanging with Mr. Stangley the
details of the duties of a post he has
accepted under the Belgian Expedition
without handing over to me the <unclear>arbives</unclear>
of the consulate or acquainting one
as to whether I should be able to 
have access to any documents or
<unclear>forins</unclear> which might be required,
alothough I saw that officer on the
day of his departure.</p>
<p>Had there been no immediate con-
sular

<pb facs="Scan20005.jpg"/>

duties to perform I should have worked
the <unclear>resurce</unclear> of Mr. du Verge for an explanation,
and also for an explanation in a matter
of a personal nature which has recently
come to light.</p>
<p>The facts of the case are these: on
the arrival on the 3rd instant of the
wrecked crew of the American whaler
"Merlin", last Santh of Alassmedes,
I called at the house of Mr. T. Mark, 
a Swiss holding a Dry Goods retailed
shop, where Mr. du Verge has hired a
room as his precedence and office. Mr.
Marh who possesses the key gave me per-
mission to enter but would not permit
me to lake the shipe reguler as thee
archives, he said, were left in his charge,
and I am unable to register my correspond-
ence in the proper official book which 
appeared to be locked away.</p>
<p>Wishing to take to my office the
ships register did not appear to me any
infraction of the rules, or had Mr. Mark
any official regled or authority to interfere
with me, for in the firck place the room
offered no facilities, for writing and in the</p>

<pb facs="Scan20006.jpg"/>

<p>Second I could not without great
inconsciousnce to myself obtain the
assistance of my mercantile clerk
to write up the register.</p>
<p>That Mr. Mash, who does not
possess the highest reputations for
soberuss or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the arch-
ives and <unclear>experintend</unclear> my actions over
them, shows a want of official con-
sideration by Mr. du Verge, and moreso
contrary to the consular instructions.
Under these circumstances and not poss-
essing the key of the rover, no <unclear>reeponci-
bility</unclear> can be attached to me for the
safety of the consular papers but I shall
endeavour to <unclear></unclear> such supervision
over them as is consistent with my
relations wiht Mr. Marti.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that there
wish a difference between Mr. du Verge
and myself but such is not the case,
if his friendly pretensions are to be con-
sidered as a proof of his sincerity, and I 
am quite at a loss ot understand what 
motive he has to pass me over in matter</p>

<pb facs="Scan20007.jpg"/>

<p>appertaning to the consular, with
which I have been connected for a long
period, having been appointed to my
present position since 1868, and for 
may years have been in note charge
of the office, without, I venture to state
giving the Department any cause of 
complaint or in any way fialed to 
discharge the duties faithfully and 
consientiously.</p>
<p>I may also state that my long 
residence here as merchant, and
holding the post of British Vice
Consul whihc I presume is not incom-
patible with my position as United 
States Vice Consul, give me a status
that facilitates considerably the settlement
of consular business with the loeal
authorities with whom I have always 
been on the most friendly and inti-
mate relationship.</p>
<p>The information that has been given
me regarding myself personally is that
Mr. Martin has failed to obtain any one
here to sign a bond for him to be Vice
Consul of Loanda form which I infer 
that</p>

<pb facs="Scan20008.jpg"/>

<p>that Mr. du Verge has applied to the 
Department to have me substituted,
but on what ground I am unable
to say.</p>
<p>In submitting the foregoing
matter for the information of the 
Department, I have te honour to
request thtat should there be no
reason why I shoulld not continue
to hold the post of Vice Consul, that
Mr. du Verge hsould be instructed
to consing the arclive of the Con-
sulate to my charge whenever he
may absent himself, and should
it be denied <unclear>espectient</unclear>, to 
upon him to explain his reasons for
showing such discourtesy to me and
am not his inferior save in Official
rank.</p>

what was done</p>

<p>United States Consualte
St. Paul de Loanda, 16th June, 1883</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to inform the Depart-
ment of hte loss of the Barque Merlin
of New Bedford, owned by Miss. Tucker &amp; C
&amp; others of that city, on the 22nd May
south of Port Alexander in <unclear>La 1:16 4</unclear>
From a statement of the Captain and crew
original of which I enclose, it appears
that she went aground in a dense fog
and owing to a heavy surf at the time
they could not save her, although they
did all in their power.</p>
<p>The Captain also states that on the voyage 
up, on <unclear>frigid</unclear> his Chronomelero, he found
them out abou 30 miles; and he loses
everything, as he was pact owner and 
was not insured. They left the vessel on
the 23rd taking what they could of
provisions and clothes, and proceeded 
north to Massamedes, where they arrived
on the 24th May, and were taken charge
of</p>

<pb facs="Scan20010.jpg"/>

<p>of, by he Portuguese authorities who
treated them most kindly, and the 
Governor charted a small vessel
to bring them here, where they arrived
on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>The Governor promised to send and
look after the vessel, and pave any-
thing that could possibly be paved,
and pay the expenses incurred, out
of the proceeds, any surplus, to be 
forwarded to the Consulate. Should 
however nothing be paved, the <unclear>Ale</unclear>
will be forwarded for payment by
first steamer.</p>
<p>When men arrived here I have some
difficulty in arranging quarters for
such a large number, however I hired
a house out of town for part, and got
the officers divided into on eor two places
and the whole expense will not exceed
a dollar a head.</p>
<p>By this steamer the Portugal bound
to Lisbon to day I send
1 of the men to St. Thiago where they
belong, 13 to Madeira, as they belong</p>

<pb facs="Scan20011.jpg"/>

<p>to St. Helena, and it is the nearest 
port where there is any communication
with that Island, and
of to Lisbon, who wish to go to America
and where there is more likelihood of
there getting a vessel.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have communication with
St. Helena, but last there is no likelihood 
of any just now, I thought it best to 
send them by this steamer, as stopping
here on chance, would only add to the 
expense. I have arranged with the Agents
of the Mail steamers, Mess. Garredo Camara C. 
to allow one third ff the usual passage
money, which makes the passages as 
follows-</p>
<p>13 men for Madeira @ 4# 520$000
                less 1/3   173$000
                           $347$000= $377.17
          St. Thiago @ 35= 210$000
                less 1/3    70$000
                            140,000= $152.17
              Lisbon @45l # 315$000
                less 1/3    105$000
                            210$000= $228.26
                            Total   $757.620</p>

<pb facs="Scan20012.jpg"/>

<p>For these amounts, I have passed Bills on
the Secretay of State at 15 days sight
in favor of Mes Garrdio Gamara C. each
one separately, so as to make it clear to 
the Captain who is a foreigner I have
also instructed him that he is to have
the Bills endorsed by the Consul where
the men are landed, otherwise they will 
not be paid by the Department.</p>
<p>I have also passed a draft for $338.00 
in favor of Mr. Fred A. Silva of Boston
to pay the board and lodging aperendoceed
voucher <del>No</del> I enclosoed.</p>
<p>Enclosed I also send certificate of Consul
du Verge's absence form this City, in

<p>loss of the above vessel on which we

went on shore at 1/2 past-12 o'clock
at-night-on the 22nd of May sontter of
Gon-aleyaudex in Lab: 16:4 it having a 
very thick fog at the time and the
land could we be seen at three ships
lengths from the sore. She struck 
heavily twice and <unclear></unclear>, the
wind at the line being a fresh break
from the S'W. AFter striking goal a
hedge anchor out and hove it might
have but this would not start her
and still continued to thump and
strike on the sand there being at
the tine a heavy pwf. the sea
breaking over the ship at times:

but we still continued to work hard
after all our hopes were over.</p>
<p>At 6 a.m. seven felt of water forward

a large anchor and on the quarter
she had worked head on to the

<p>It was impossible to land at this

as soon as possible as we had done

night it would have been dangerous
to have got clean of her with the

personal effects and provisions and
left her at 2 p.m. on the 23rd May 
for Little Fish Bay about 60 miles
distant. The vessel when we left 
her had silted 6 feet in the sand.

<p>Translation</p>

<p>I, the undersigned, Chief of
Board of Health of the province
of Angola, do hereby certify that
L de Rathier du Verge Esq., Consul
of the United States of America at
Loanda, has, since his arrival at
this city, suffered from enduried 
diseases: </p>
<p>The misamedted poison has man-
ifested itself through the intermit-
tent fevers in their various forms,
together with inflamation of the
intert and the library ducts,
congestion of the liver and spleen,
lilious ferus and slight dysenta
ries.</p>
<p>The medicinal treatment not
having obtained a complete cure,
I advised a voyage to the south 
of the province; but the result
was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>For this reason, and seeing that
the patient's health is visibily de-
clining, from day to day, I am 
of opinion that he should, at once, return</p>

<pb facs="Scan20030.jpg"/>

<p>return to America, at the risk of
his life should he remain longer
under the influence of this climate.
The above ismy opinion which I will
conferm under oath, if necessary.</p>
<p>Given at the Board of Health of 
the province of Angola at Loanda
on the 12th day of May 1883.</p>

<p>To
Hon. John Davis
Asst. Secty of State 
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
After a very <unclear>confule</unclear> study and close obervation
of the United Vice Consul as reported in my dispatch
No 34, I am compelled to state that I came to
the conclusion that a chagne ought to be made
in the United Vice consular appointment of
this city, for the benefit of the United Staes 
Government, its cit and commence-</p>
<p>I believe in fair dealings, but above
all int he appointment of peoples who
are attached tp, and respect the United 
States of America, and who try to do 
their utmost to promote its commerce,
interest, and general success.</p>
<p>Mess. Robert I Neurton and J. Comenge
came here almost 14 years ago as clercks
of the late United States Commercial agent</p>

<pb facs="Scan20033.jpg"/>

<p>A.A. Libra of Boston Mass, and one of the richest
merchant of Angola.</p>
<p>A few years ago W. libra left for his home, <unclear></unclear>
Mass, but unfortunately died at sea from 
causes unknown.</p>
<p>Since W. Sima death these two young men
clerks took the whole business of Capt. M. Sima
and have paid his brother Frederick A. Silva of
Charlestown Mass. the amount received from
the United States Government for services
as U.S. Vice Commercial Agent and lately
promoted by Mr. Jackson the U.S. Consul
who resigned his post of the "one mouth
Mesedina" as U.S. Vice Consul.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert S. Newton today is R.B.
Majesty paid Vice Consul in tis city, and
being concerned with English gilding on--
<unclear>broidery</unclear> S.S. canes no longer for the ritual
of the Untied States S.S.S.</p>
<p>I willnot enter into particulars
concerning the gentlemen, although
I can change him of disobedience to orders
of others, but I will say that it is my
<unclear>ofsincon</unclear> and that without entertaining
any prejudice or had feeligs toward him 
whatsoever.</p>

<p>Beside the right of his <unclear>remasal</unclear> by my dispatch
No 3 from State Depart. data March 13th
1882 and dsigned J.C. Bancroft Davies
Asst. Secty. of State.</p>
<p>I must repeat that for the benefit of Americans
interests, "of such can he hoped for here," after
on the private letters of mote to my old tiefs,
owners, merchants S with whom I am 
acquainted in Massachusetts, New York,
Maryland, Florida, North and South Carolina
and Maine; and caused <unclear></unclear> the contents
of Capt. Perry's leters, changing his plans
for supplying the Americans Whaling
ships at Loanda S.S. That I call
the attention of the State Department
for an immediate change.</p>
<p>An <unclear></unclear> State Consul came also
be her B. Majesty Consul neither can
M.BB. Majesty's Consul be a true United 
States consul in this part of the Coast.</p>
<p>I would respectfully suggest that 
Mr. Francis Martims Smart a new
ceducated gentleman, and a rising young
merchant of Loanda speaking several 
languages, he very lately ordered from the</p>

<pb facs="Scan20035.jpg"/>

<p>United States, the few congo of Lumber S.S. who 
was brought here by the Am: Back Horace
Scudder under <unclear></unclear> the name of Newton <unclear></unclear>
I believe that this change will benefit
the American common.</p>
<p>I will also report that during my short
absence north, an am: Whaling boat was
lost south of Masssamedes. The Capt. officers
and crew came ot Loanda, and were sent
to Lisbon, by Portuguese mail steamer Portugal
on my return on board the U.S.S. Lumber
leapt A. Ludlow I asked Mr. Newton
about the copy of affidavid concerning
the loss of that vessel and the ammount 
he had paid for th ship wrecked crew
his answer was, that he had sent every
home; and had no copies. I will
mention that in that case, one half of 
the crew were shipped in st. Helana
about 21 months previous of their Cass. and
instead of sending their new boat to 
St. Helena by one of the Welsh he had
chartered to carry cattles for the British
govt. at Ascention he forwarded them 
to Lisbon at a great expense.</p>

<pb facs="Scan20036.jpg"/>

<p>I'm jact Mr. Tenton do not want to have
any superior officer here and Mr. Jackson 
the late U.S. Consul here, went home and
resigned his consulate by Mr. Newton paying
him the full amoutn of his expenses from
home to Loanda and from Loanda to the 
Untied States.</p>

<p>United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda
January 15 1884: <unclear>her Clutto</unclear></p>

<p>Sir
Mon d Verge by lettered dated
Nov. 3 1883, of which copy is herewith
enclosed, having informed me that he
included to proceed to the United States
on leave of absence granted to hence
by the Department, and being now in
charge of the Consulate, I have to
acknowledge the receipt of your
dispatch No 20 of the 26th October
last, informing Mon du Verge that his
nomination of Francisco Marhins Pevart
as Vice Consul to succeed we has been 
approved, and enclosing a black form
of bond which should be executed and 
returned</p>

<pb facs="Scan30007.jpg"/>

<p>returned to the Department of State 
with information as to Mon Swart;s 
rationality.</p>
<p>In compliance with this request I have
to inform you that Mon Swart is a 
Portuguese subject and a merchant
of this place, holding the appointment
of Spanish Vice Consul, but left for 
Europe in the month of July last
and is still absent; and I have not
any <unclear>inean</unclear> of knowing the exact date
he intended to return, or whether as
so rumoured, he purposed residing
permanently in Lisbon.</p>
<p>I have therefore the honor to return 
<del>the plank</del> the blank force of bond
for such ulterior measures as may be
<unclear>decuted</unclear> fit.</p>
<p>Having thus become acquainted with 
the</p>


<pb facs="Scan30008.jpg"/>

<p>the fact of being suspended without
having rendered any resignation, or
informed in any way by Mn du Verge
of his having nominated Mn. Swart
to fulfil the duties of Vice Consul- an
appointment not intimated to or 
acknowledged by the local Government-
I am reluctantly compelled to conclude 
that the Department must have been 
altogether misinformed on the subject,
and the representations made by 
Mn du Verge a compilation of
<unclear>unistatements</unclear>, which would appear
to be a leading characteristic of that 
officer in nearly all <unclear>reansactious</unclear>
connected with his proceedings when
here. </p>
<p>As however Mn du Verge has
taken with him the official 
correspondence</p>

<pb facs="Scan30009.jpg"/>

<p>correspondence book and the various 
dispatches, prior to the one now adverted
to. I am unable to see on what grounds 
he demanded my substitution, after a 
service which has, for the last fourteen 
years been approved of by the Government.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I 
have to submit whether, conformably
with official procedure, and as a matter
of personal satisfaction, the Department
will not, prior to re-confirming,
Mn. Swarts' nomination, transmit to 
me a copy of Mn du Verge's dispatch on dispatches
on the subjec, in order that I may
offer such explanations as the case
warrants.</p>
<p>Mn du Verge may or may 
not have been <unclear>actinated</unclear> by 
consideration of a higher nature
than</p>

<pb facs="Scan30010.jpg"/>

<p>than personal disappointment at
finding me unwilling to connect
him with my commercial house,
and although he had no grounds
for such expectations, his subsequent
proceedings in the Congo (where he
was employed at a salary, I understand
of 400 a year) as chief of the <unclear></unclear>  <!--there is a pound symbol for money in front of 400.-->
station of the Stanley Expedition, and
his compulsory retirement from that
past at the request of Major General
Sir Frederick Goldsmid, who came
out to the Congo last year, on a special
mission from the King of the Belgians,
have not tended to produce that 
confidence which should have
distinguished an officer of the Consular
Service, and who had not gained the 
consideration or respect either of the 
Governor</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
JUL 1 1884
RECEIVER</p>

<p>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
14 June 1883</p>

<p>To the Assistant Secretary of State
Washington</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to lay below the Department
of State the following circumstances connected with
the discharge of my duties as Vice-Consul for the 
United States at this port. M L de R du Verge
left Loanda for the Congo on the 16th ultimo by the
Portuguese Mail Steamer for the purpose it is reported
of arranging with 11th Stanley the details of the post he
has accepted under the Belgian Expedition without 
handing over to me the Archives of the Consulate or
acquainting me as to whether I should be able
to have access to any documents or forms which
might he required, although I saw that officer on
the day of his departure.</p>
<p>Had there been no immediate Consular duties
to perform I should have waited the return of 10
du Verge for an explanation of this, and also for an
explanation on a matter of a personal nature which
has recently come to light.</p>
<p>The facts of the case are these: On the arrival
on the thid inst of the wrecked crew of the American
Whalt "Merlin" marti, a Swiss, holding a Dry
Goods Retail Shop where Mr Du Verge had hired a 
room, as his residence and offices, Mr Marti who
possesses the key gave me permission to enter but
would not permit me to take the ships Register as
the Archives he said were left in his charge and I am 
unable</p>

<pb facs="Scan30019.jpg"/> 

<p>unable to register my official correspondence in the
proper official Book which appeared to be locked away.</p>
<p>Wishing to take to my office the Ships
Register did not appear to me any infraction of
the rules or had Mr Marti any official right or 
Authority to interfere with me, for in the first place
the room offered no facilities for writing, and in
the Second I could not without great inconvenience
to myself obtain the assistance of my mercantile clerk
to write up the register.</p>
<p>That Mr Marti who does not possess the
highest reputation for soberness or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the archives and superintend
my actions over theme, shows a want of official
consideration by Mr du Verge and is more over contrary 
to the instructions.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances and not
possessing the key of the room no responsibility can
be attached to me for the safety of the Consular
papers but I shall endeavour to exercise such
supervision over them as is consistent with my 
relations with Mr Marti.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that there exists a
difference between Mr du Verge and myself but such
is not the case if his friendly pretensions are to be 
considered as a proof of his sincerity and I am
quite at a loss to understand what movtive he has 
to pass me over in matters appertaining to the
consulate with which I have been connected for
a long period having been appointed to my present
position since 1868. And for many years have been 
in sole charge of the office without, I venture to 
state, giving the Department any cause of complaint</p>

<pb facs="Scan30020.jpg"/> 

<p>or in any way failed to discharge the duties faithfully
and conscientiously</p>
<p>I may also state that my long residence
here as Merchant and holding the post of British-Vice-
Consul which I presume is not incompatible with
my position as United States Vice-Consul, give me
a status that facilitates considerably the settlement
of Consular business with the local authorities, with
whom I have always been on the most friendly and
intimate relationship.</p>
<p>The information that has been given regarding
myself personally is that Mr Marti has failed to obtain
any one here to sign a bond for him to be Vice Consul at
Loanda, from which I infer that Mr du Verge has
applied to the Department to have me substituted but 
on what ground I am unable to say.</p>
<p>In submitting the foregoing matters for the
information of the Department I have the honor to 
request that should there be no reason why I should
 not continue to hold the post of Vice-Consul, that 
Mr du Verge should be instructed to cosign the
archives of the Consulate to my charge whenever he
may absent himself and, should it be deemed
expedient, to call upon him to explain his reasons
for showing such discourtesies to me, as I am
not his inferior save in official rank. </p>

<p>Sir
I am advised of the non-payment of the
two Bills No 4 $350 and No8 $144 drawn
in my favor by Consul du Verge on the Secretary
of the Treasury on the ground that he was in a 
condition not responsible for his actions at the
tint of signing.</p>
<p>I beg to enclose copy of a dispatch I
find has been inserted in the Official Correspondence
Book by Mr du Verge advising the drawing
of one of these bills.</p>
<p>These Bills were sent to me by M du Verge
from Banana in a letter of which I have the 
honor to transmit a copy.</p>
<p>While Mr du Verge was in the Congo he
ordered in his capacity as cheif of the Station at
Vici, of the Belgians Association, Several articles which
were charged to him and as it will be seen by the
enclosed copy of account, there remained a balance
after payment of his Bills, which I did not for a  
moment doubt, due to him of 30:3:4 for which <!--there is a pound symbol for money in front of 30.-->
I remitted to him, by the racket of the 15th of last
month. </p>

<pb facs="Scan30022.jpg"/> 

<p>month a Bill on my Agents. The payment of that
Bill I have ordered to be stopped in the usual way
until further reasons are given for the non-
payment of the said two Bills by the Secretary 
of the Treasury.</p>
<p>There will I venture to believe be very
little doubt in your mind that the allegation
set forth by Mr du Verge is a vile invention to
serve his own ends and an act inconsistent with
integrity and honesty. If therefore Mr du Verge
cannot be called upon by the Government to make
good the Amount he is now indebted to me I 
shall be under the painful necessity of prosecuting 
him by law</p>
<p>I may state that there are several persons
residents in this city who saw Mr du Verge at
Banana in the Congo previous to his departure
for Europe as well as the Captain of the Steamer
in which he took passage could state that he 
did not appear to be in any way irresponsible
for his acts.</p>

<p>Loanda. Aug. 15. 1884</p>

<p>Robt Newton Esq
Vice Consul of U.S.A.
at Loanda
Africa.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,
The following is a concise statemet of the facts with reference
to our expulsion from Bailundo and Bihé.</p>
<p>The "American Mission" as we are commonly designated was
etablished in April 1884 in Bailundo and extended to Bihe 
in March of the present year. In both of these countries
we held the most friendly relations with the natives, both the
Sobas adn the people at large. I Bihe these amicable
relaitons continued to the day of our departure and we still
have the invitation of the Loba of that country to come there 
in a body.</p>
<p>In Bailurdo our peace was disturbed on the 15th of May by
a letter bearing the signature of the Soba &amp; his consellors
command to depart from Bailundo and all its
dependencies</p>

<pb facs="Scan40005.jpg"/> 

<p>dependencies and never to <unclear>petur</unclear> and forbidding any of the
mission to vesel the King in person as was our custom when
carrying on any important negotiation with him.</p>
<p>So sudden a change in the <unclear>treakwent</unclear> of how Sobaenho
had always protected us in every way possible to him
required explanation. Negotiations continued for
six weeks brought to light the following facts</p>
<p>Mr Braga a Trader at Calumbella had gone to Bihé
and there <unclear>treed</unclear> to induce the Soba to expel that part of the
mission which was located there, but failed to
accomplish his purpose the Soba not only refusing
to send away those who were there, but inveiting the whole
mission to locale in his country, a thing which was
under the circumstances impossible.</p>
<p>Proceeding to Bailundo Mr Braga brought the
full power of his influence to bear upon the Soba there.
He informed him that we intended to kill the Soba
blow up his village, destroy his family, and take
possession of the country. Then that information 
failed</p>

<pb facs="Scan40006.jpg"/> 

<p>failed to move the Soba he told him, we had committed
<unclear>ceinces</unclear> in our country, and he had been sent by the
Governor of Benguella, to drive us out and if the Soba
should refuse to send us away he would get
himself and his country into trouble.</p>
<p>(I) the sauce <unclear></unclear> Mr B kindly conseuled to come 
and occupy our village and give the Soba and his men
al the Whiskey they would if he would drive us out and
he even went so far in his benevolent offers us to say he
would be willing to bury our houses and kill us all if the 
Kin would give him permission to do so. But the King
refused. Several of the Mission heard Mr B's Seerelary
say that this master advised the King to Kill us but the 
King refused.</p>
<p>Though unwilling to have us killed the Soba was
quite unable to withstand the pressure which was brought
upon him to drive us out and we were compelled to 
leave July 4th. Mr B. immediately taking possession
of our houses.</p>

<pb facs="Scan40007.jpg"/> 

<p>He reached Benguella July 20th after a severe and to
the ladies and children, perilous journey with our
lives, a little clothing and nothing more. Al of our 
large and costly outfit having been of necessity left
behind.</p>
<p>The Governor of Benguella to whom we applied
for redress, has in accordance with his own requet been
forwarded with an <unclear>eslinate</unclear> of our loss.</p>

I have the honor to draw the attention of

13th 1884 to which I have as yet received no 
answer.</p>
<p>I have again a request from the
merchant at Mossamedes 11th Manoel José
Alves Bastos, owner of the Cahique that brought
the shipwrecked crew of the vessel "Merlis"
from Mossamedes to this port in 1883 for
payment of the freight viz: 300000 equal
to $325 00/100 and I beg to request that the
Government will authorize me to pay him
at once as Mr Bastos has been always
exceedingly kind and of great service to all
American Sailors that have come to his port. 
Unless</p>

<p>United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda
November 11 1884</p>

<p>Sir
During the last month 
I have been on a visit along
the coast in one of the mail
steamers as far as Mayumba
and also visited Banana
Landana and Loango and
returned here in <unclear>H.M.L. Flirt</unclear>
on the 23rd October, the Captain
having been kind enough 
to giv me a passage to Loanda.</p>
<p>As the particulars of my
trip may be of interest to 
the Department I beg to submit
some at Banana. I met</p>

<pb facs="Scan40017.jpg"/> 

<p>Sir Francis de Winton, Chief
Administrator of the International
Association and from a 
conversation I had with him
he seems anxious to eradicate
certain bad opinions that are
prevalent among the traders
affirming that he is willing
to assist them in every way and
glad to see them going ahead
and following in the footsteps
of the Association, and that 
he has no idea whatever of
putting any difficulty in the
way of any person wishing to
open trade. He is trying to 
get things into good working
order as up to the present
there has been no system whatever 
and</p>

<pb facs="Scan40018.jpg"/> 

<p>and a great waste of money.</p>
<p>He talks of a small railway 
from York to Stanley Pool a
distance of about 230 miles to
open up the country calculating
that the coast would be $2000.000.
but to show any result he would
require a traffic of at least
100 tons a day at <unclear>freight</unclear> of
about <unclear></unclear>. I think this
would be a very bad invest-
ment as there are many qualities
of African produce that could
afford to pay such a price unless
 it was obtained in the interior 
for mere normal value and 
I must say that I do not see 
where the 100 tons a day are to 
come from.</p>

<pb facs="Scan40019.jpg"/> 

<p>I also <unclear></unclear> here Captain Grant
Elliott, Administrator for
the Association at Loango, and
his idea is a railway from
the <unclear>Accuills</unclear> and up the Niarri
valley which would be almost
a direct line to Stanley Pool
and much less expensive as
they would not have such a
mountainous district to go 
through.</p>
<p>Harely in the Congo between
Nokki and Boma the Dutch
House had two factories one at
Caicaurio and the other at
Mussuca vurnt down by the 
malives, suffering great loss, there
being at the time over 6000 of
ivory and 7 tons of rubber besides 
a</p>

<pb facs="Scan40020.jpg"/> 

<p>a great quantity of goods
for trade; the loss is estimated
at $15,000</p> 
<p>The Dutch have attacked 
the malives and burnt  number
of villages and taken the King
and Queen of Caicamaxio prisoners.</p>
<p>I found the German Man
of War "Moewe" had been at Banana
taking Coal and sailed for Angera
Sequena on the 16th September.
She had Dr. Nachligal on board 
and I heard that a large German
Expedition is reported as about
to start form Africa Sequena
for the upper Congo, so no doubt
Dr. Nachligal has gone there to
weet them.</p>
<p>At Landana I found the
French</p>

<pb facs="Scan40021.jpg"/> 

<p>French Man of War "Lepond: and
the Portuguese Sunboat Lado
with the Secretary of the Government
 of Angola on board, swing to a 
question between the French
missionaries established there
and the natives aout some ground
that they (the missionaries) had
taken charge of, and they had
requested a man of War to come
to their assistance as they would not recognize the authority of the
Portuguese Delegate who was in 
charge, as Landana was supposed
to be within the Portuguese Protectorate.</p>
<p>The first question the French 
took up was that Landana was
within the disputed territory of
5o 12' &amp; So South, and after the 
Observations</p>

<pb facs="Scan40022.jpg"/> 

<p>observations had been taken by the
officers of both ships it was determined 
that Landana was not within
the Portuguese Protectorale, but
within the disputed territory, so
the French were perfectly justified
in settling the question with the
missionaries without the interference
of the Portuguese.</p>
<p>The line of 5o 12' south comes
nearly to the south bank of the
Chiloango river, so that Landana
is within the territory of 5o 12' south
and 8o north and the Protectorale
of Massabi and Landana is really
of very little importance as nearly
all the trade is passed through
Landana; no doubt it is a great
disappointment ot the Portuguese
but</p>

<pb facs="Scan40023.jpg"/> 

<p>but as they have got a treaty
with the Chief at Landana they
way take charge of it at <unclear>soute</unclear>
future day. I think it little else
but just that they should as the
natures with few exceptions talk
Portuguese and any palaver
whatever is obliged to be decided
in that language</p>
<p>At Loango I visited the
merchants and the Chief of the
International Association who
gave some information that may
be useful about the disputed
points on the coast. I therefore
beg to enclose a sketch nap.
The colours, <unclear>Achice</unclear> show the territory
occupied by the French.</p>
<p>Do Red International Association</p>

<pb facs="Scan40024.jpg"/> 

<p>Do "Green" which the
French are disputing with the
Asociation.</p>
<p>Do Blue the Portuguese
Protectorale of Massabi and
Landana as it is now admitted
to be.</p>
<p>The red points are places at which
the Association has stations.
At Loango there is a French
Lieutenant and some soldiers
who are in constant questions
with the Association as they claim
the territory from Granville to
Ponta Banda, and are giving
these as much trouble as they
possibly can, as they say they
wish to pay them off here for
the manner in which De Brazza
was</p>

<pb facs="Scan40025.jpg"/> 

<p>was treated by the Association
at Stanley Pool</p>
<p>On arrival of any vessel on
the coast it is usual for the
Merchant to hoist their flags to 
show their nationality and I was
surprised when I went on shore
accompanied by the captain of 
the Man of War to see the
Merchants <unclear>hanling</unclear> down their
flags, and ws informed by them
that the French Commandate 
has issued a circular informing
them that they were not allowed 
to hoist flags except on Lundags 
or when the mail steamer came.
Here the houses are two American
and four Portuguese but the trade
is nearly all direct with England
I</p>

<pb facs="Scan40026.jpg"/> 

<p>I noticed at several of the French
places al the Merchants are obliged
to hoist the French flag no matter
what nation they belong to and
I hear that any vessel proceeding
up the river above Gaboon are
obliged to hoist French colors.</p>
<p>Black Point is also a French
station, and there is here established
a sailor and it or 5 soldiers, but
is a place of little importance as
to trade. I touched at several other
places on the coat, but I have
nothing of importance to relase
regarding them. Trade is bad
and there are great complaints
all along the coast.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to report for the information
of the Department that the Germnan Gambeaets
"Move" arrived here in the 8th nest from Angra
Gegnena calling at all the ports on her way up.
Du Nachligal is on board and proceeds North 
in her, touching at the various pots on her way,
and on reaching St Vincent I understand her or 
proceeds home, the Moive still remaining on
the station. From a conversation I had with
Du Nachigal, who slayed at Angra Pegnera
while the "Moive" went to the Cape, and who
went some distance into the interior, it seems
but a poor place to establish a Colony and 
more resembles a desert than anything else.
Four German Corvettes from the North are 
expected here shortly</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
circular dated August 21st and is reply have to state
that the principal duties of  tis consulate at this port 
are-</p>
<p>Taking charge of distressed subjects principally belonging
to news of Whalers; during the last 18 months about 60
have applied to this Consulate and they would have been
in great difficulties if no Consulate existed. Generally
two trading vessels come every year and the imports
from America may be put down on an average in
this way at about $12000. The exports are <unclear></unclear> as
there are no American houses here and the produce
is sent principally to Lisbon and Liverpool</p>
<p>Very often Whalers come into Port who as a rule would be in
great difficulties with their news in the event of their
being no Consulate. Last year I have Whalers in
Port at on line.</p>
<p>These I may say are the principal duties
of the Consul at this Port.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to enclose translation of a dispatch
recieved from his Excellency the Governor General in reply to
a dispatch I wrote him, with reference to the American
Mission lately expelled from Bailunda &amp; Bihé. Since that
date Mr Walters a document with the
private seal of the Government attached, to the cheifs of
Bailunda &amp; Bihé requesting them to do all in their power to
assist the Mission and informing the said chiefs that any
persons presenting themselves for the future as representing
the Government, must present a similar seal before they are
to be recognized as such. Mr Lannders another member of
the Mission has reformed to Bailunda and they appear
to have great hopes of recovering the greater part of their
property.</p>
<p>The governor has also offered to give the
Mission a grant of land to the extent of 1000 hectares
or</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
MAR 2 1885
RECEIVED.</p>

<p>Loanda
November 18 1884</p>

<p>Sir
I received your dispatch of the
19th ult in which you not only enclosed
the guarentees that the American
Mission westies to re-establish itself
in Bailundo, but even an account
of the effects and their value cost
by the mission, which are supposed
to be in possession of the Sobba who
is held ot be responsible for them.</p>
<p>No one saw with greater pregret than
myself, that the Sobba of Bailudo
could commit the same violence to
the American Missionaries as he has
at since committed on the Portuguese
merchants and which certainly, neither
you, Sir, nor the Mission can think 
that such violences could have been ordered
authorized or even insinuated either by
me or any other Portuguese with the
least investiture of authority. Of 
this</p>

<pb facs="Scan50008.jpg"/> 

<p>this the missionaries ought to be convinced
as the governor of Benguella has more
than once repeated it, and this I now
confirm</p>
<p>In the interior the Sobbas far from
the sight of <unclear>swiched</unclear> authority, commit
thefts and extortions, that constitute one
of the greatest risks of one employed
in the cuilisation of the African races
who as savages are eminently suspicions
and no one can certainly make the
European Authorities responsible for 
this special character, at most times
excited in their malpractices by political
intention and sonie times pesesible, at
others secretly manifested for the
travellers and missionaries who
parting from the scientific sphere
or from preaching the Gospel
give to their position in the
interior on irritant situation of which
anyone can imagine with <unclear></unclear> or
less accuracy when he judges himself
prejudiced by these intentions, in his
interests and especially that of</p>

<pb facs="Scan50009.jpg"/> 

<p>of commercial game.</p>
<p>By what is affirmed by the missionaries,
it appears that they were given notice
to leave Baclundo in eight days and
even then they stayed six weeks, and
it seems only rational that during
that time they should have sent
one of their members to Benguella
to obtain a letter from the
Governor to the Sobba to assure
him that in ivtrateur intrigues 
my name or that governor's weight
be involved, had no foundation whatever
and was utterly false.</p>
<p>This the missionaries did not do and
consequently they have only themselves
to blame. What part the Portuguese
merchant Braga weight have had in
the matter that very much. <unclear>Ilament</unclear>
to have been the determination of the
Sobba of Bailundo, I cannot sell
you, as I await information from
the Governor of Benguella who lift
for the interior with the intention
of complaining of the affair and
to</p>

<pb facs="Scan50010.jpg"/>

<p>to release personally what had taken
place to enable one to do ensure justice.
At present we have the simple
declaration of the missionaries, there
is yet to be heard the Sobba, and 
it is this that I enjoined the 
governor to do.</p>
<p>The habitual complaint of the
merchants of Benguella is that
the American Mission tried by
every possible means to deviate 
the flow of commerce from Bengulla,
and this might perchance have
influenced the spirit of one less
cautious to have provoked the
Sobba and his ministers to do what
they did, this <unclear></unclear> them a pretext,
which until today they have
not wanted, to behave in a 
like manner to some of the Portuguese
merchant, under fusile reasons of
"felish" that have only had their
orgin from the coveteousness and
freediness of the heathen population, always
incited by the knowledge that they may 
have</p>

<pb facs="Scan50011.jpg"/>

<p>have of the existence of goods in the
hands of the inland trader.</p>
<p>The experienced opinion of Libva Porto
is that what has now occurred to the
American Mission he had long thought
one day would happen as he well
knows the character of the Bailundos,
not being able to state if the affair
really occurred as the missionaries state
or even if any Portuguese merchants
directly or indirectly took part.</p>
<p>The comportment of this illustrous 
Portuguese settler to the English Missionary
whose letter you enclose in one of your
dispatches to which I reply wakes his
statement altogether beyond questioning
as he offered him his house in Bihé to
stop as long as he pleased so long as he
only preached the gospel and did not
enter into policies, for from the moment
he did he would have to leave the
house in order not to compromise Sibba
Porto with the values.</p>
<p>Not less is the complaint of the Sobba
against the American Missionaries concerning
their</p>

<pb facs="Scan50012.jpg"/>

<p>political interference than is the
complaint of the merchants of
Benguella concerning the supposed
meddling in trade to which I already
referred and therefore it will be
much better that at the missionaries
on their return to Bailundo wake
a problem declaration or oath according
to their religion before witnessess and
the authorities that they do not intend
to inluence in any prejudicial way
the trade of Benguella, but that they 
<unclear></unclear> go to preach the gospel and
the doctrine of Christ. She oath that
I suggest would for my part be
perfectly unnecessary but the public 
skirt in the country is irritated
against the missionaries, and in
as much as such a promise would 
be a means of pacifying and
dispersing any double that may remain
and which certainly can cost nothing
to the conciliating and Evangelical spirit
of the missionaries.</p>
<p>As you Sir, can well imagine I cannot 
give</p>

<pb facs="Scan50013.jpg"/>

<p>give a decisive opinion upon the
subject without first having the
report of the governor of Benguella's
voyage into the interior, nor can I 
guarentee the behavior of the Sobba
and have not sufficient forces in 
Bailundo, and much less can I
exact from him the payment that
the mission claims.</p>
<p>The mission established itself in the
interior without consulting the Portuguese
government as to what port of guarentee
it might have for its members and properly,
ran of its own accord the risk where
to the kind of exploration in which it 
was engaged. If the government had
been consulled it would most certainly
have said that the natives of Bailundo
are treacherous and that only by a 
miracle could the missionaries uphold
themselves, more so as soon as the Mission
had a means and especially that of goods,
incentive to the habitual malpractices
of the native.</p>
<p>The American Mission can then when 
it</p>

<pb facs="Scan50014.jpg"/>

<p>likes. establish itself where best it thinks
fit; what the portuguese government 
cannot do is to guarantee that
the Sobba shall not repeat his violences
because that, no country could do
to which he was a vassal, nor could
it keep a competent military force the
expense of which no mission could
compensase.</p>
<p>What the Portuguese government can
and will do as soon as it has
properly heard the question is to
place regular authorities in Bailundo
and Bihé to maintain the equilibrium
of intercourse between the Sobba and 
merchants or missionaries, and so
forward itself by trustworthy
notices &amp; reports against the affirmations
of other contradictory parties, and
in that came while the Portuguese
government act like this they will
have to limit the guarantee that
they offer to those establishing them-
selves in Bihé and Bailundo,
which can reasonably be claimed
taking</p>

<pb facs="Scan50015.jpg"/>

<p>taking into consideration the state of
the people of these two districts at the 
same time nothing that the guarantee
will be ensure in the districts like
Bacondo &amp; guillengues where the preaching
of the gospel would be as useful as
in Bailundo or Bihé, and that will
have to be combined between the
interested parties and the nature 
authorities of the place before a Portuguese
authority that will be placed there,
when missionaries or merchants wish
to establish themselves in neighbourhoods
where only reigns nature customs, simply
restricted by vassalage sworn to the
<unclear></unclear> of Portugal</p>
<p>As to the English missionary
the writer of the letter to which
I have already referred, it appears
to me that the prestige of the settler
Silva Porto to whom he is much indebted
and from whom he has derived great
heep to him it ought to b sufficient
guarantee to chafferers that as much
to him and his subordinates, or even 
others </p>

<pb facs="Scan50016.jpg"/>

<p>independent of him, that they
will not have to complain of
any interference in their work
of civilisation, so long as they
keep themselves to that, and do 
not interfere in politics whether
unalive or European, in which case
the Portuguese government cannot
be responsible in anyway whatever
for the behaviour of the savage
tribes, amongst whom they may
establish their theatre of operations
contrary to its ostensible ends.</p>

<p>United States Consulate
Loanda 10 April 1885.</p>

<p>I have the honor to enforce you that on the
18th of March last, Bishop W. Taylor accompanied by
18 men 4 women and 116 children, arrived
here in the "Biafra" British Mail Steamer from
Liverpool.</p>
<p>They have come from the United States for
establish Missions, in this Colony which have for
their object the teaching of the natives, not only in
religious matters but also in Industrial peersecits</p>
<p>The Governor General being at present
absent from Loanda, I could not prevent the
Bishop to him, he however will return at the
end of this swath and I hsall then do so.
I do not anticipate any objection on his part to
the Mission, but on the contrary think that he
will render them such assistance as lays in
his province, to esetablish themselves ad will
extend his protection to them so long as
they confine themselves to the objects they
<unclear>ostensibly</unclear> purpose.</p>
<p>My impression is that a Mission
composed as this is of so great a number of
people including so many women and children
coming.</p>

<pb facs="Scan50025.jpg"/>

<p>coming to this Colony is not a well advised measure
They come here as a "self-supporting" mission to a 
country entirely unknown to them, and unfortunately
without the apparent <unclear>requisile</unclear> means to wake their
mission a success. There funds are very <unclear></unclear>
to give immediate returns as in their ease is 
necessary.</p>
<p>The son of the Bishop, Mr Ross Taylor leaves
by this Mail "Corisco" for Liverpool taking with him
his wife (who has been ill since her arrival here)
and four children. Another member of the 
Mission a Mr Mackay also is anxious to leave
through ill health, but has not the means to do
so. Other members are suffering from the effecto of
the climate and I very much doubt if their
condition will improve when they get up country
and have only themselves and their own efforts
to defend upon.</p>
<p>They have fixed on two sites some three
hundred miles from here, in the interior, selected by
one of their number Dr Somers and as soon as they
get the permission of the Governor General several
of the numbers will move to them.</p>

<p>Requesting leave of absence
Abstract of Contents.</p>

<p>Requesting leave of absence from 
December next to March 1887.
Nominates for appointment
by Department during his
absence Edward Bannister.
Asks for standing permission
to take leave of absence when
circumstances compel his
departure.</p>

<p>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
30th September 1886</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to request
the Department to grant me leave of 
absence. I wish to take my wife to 
England in December next as I find
the climate does not agree with his,
and as I intend returning in March
next, I shall be absent only three or
four months.</p>
<p>I beg alas to request the Depart-
ment to allow me the liberty to
nominate my chief clerk in my
commercial business, <unclear>Edward</unclear>
Bannister, to act as Vice Concil 
during my absence, Mr Bent who
formerly acted being no longer in 
my</p>

<pb facs="Scan60025.jpg"/>

<p>my employ and not likely to return
to Loanda.</p>
<p>As I have been here now nearly
twenty years I find it necessary that
I should visit a cold climate more
frequently than I have hitherto done
and when lack at home my doctor
recommended that I should at
least try and take a home once
a year.</p>
<p>In consideration of these cir-
cumstances, the unhealthy nature
of this locality, and the long since
I have resided here I take the liberty
to solicit the Department for a standing
permission to take leave of absence
whenever circumstances compel
my departure from this place.</p>
<p>This request may appear to be</p>

<pb facs="Scan60026.jpg"/>

<p>a departure from the general
custom of the department, but
I <unclear></unclear> that the special nature
of the case may induce you to
take the matter into favorable

<p>Sir
I have the honor to submit
to the Department the following con-
cise report on the trade of commander
of the Province of Angola, confining
myself more particularly to that part
of the province in the immediate
vicinity of the Capital, Loanda.</p>
<p>We are pacing through
a crisis at present which for the
last two years has been very <unclear></unclear>
fell and which recurs once in about
every ten or eleven years, consequent
on what may be termed a gradual 
rise.</p>

<p>the
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington
D.C.</p>

<pb facs="Scan70002.jpg"/>

<p>rise and fall in the rainy reasons.
During the year 1885 the rains were 
very light and this year they have
been lighter still. The small rains
usually commence in September and
end the latter end of November or
beginning of December, and the heavy
rains commence in February and
end in the middle of May.</p>
<p>Such light rain falls have not 
been known for twenty years, but
we may now look for a gradual
increase in quantity up to the
year 1890, and again a gradual
<unclear>diruninution</unclear> after that year until
a drought is again experienced.</p>
<p>These influences on agriculture
may be appreciated, and as the 
principal products of the country 
are</p>

<pb facs="Scan70003.jpg"/>

<p>are vegetable, want of hair has
caused complete stagnation in
trade and commerce. Add to this
the very low prices coffee, oil, and 
rubber have commanded in European
markets and the cause of the crisis is
plain</p>
<p>Exports. The exports are prin-
cipally coffee, rubber, pam oil,
coton, <del>rubber</del> and bus-wsa. The
most important however is coffee,a
large amount of capital being expended
in its growth. It is mostly exported
to Portugal and consequently gives em-
ployment to some Portuguese skipping.</p>
<p>But little of the produce of the 
province is shipped to other come
<unclear></unclear> The total value of exports from
Loanda during 1885 was $897.930 0/00
as</p>

<pb facs="Scan70004.jpg"/>

<p>as against $1,234.900 0/00 in 1884</p>
<p>The following table shows count
tries to which produce was exported
with valves.</p>
<p>Portugal 677.405</p>
<p>Holland 116.045</p>
<p>England 100.320</p>
<p>Portuguese <unclear></unclear> 4.160
           $897.930 0/00</p>
<p>Imports. The imports are very varied
in description comprising <unclear></unclear> fabrics,
earthenware, hardware, wives, flour,
timber, petroleum, and
soap are imported from the United
States- The following table shows
countries from which articles are
imported and values of same
for the year 1885.</p>

<pb facs="Scan70005.jpg"/>

<p>England $816.895</p>
<p>Portugal 254.495</p>
<p>Holland 41.915</p>
<p>France 63.190</p>
<p>United States 1.380</p>
<p>Brazil 1.860</p>
<p>Germany 14.035</p>
<p>        $1.195750 0/00</p>

<p>We can calculate only on one
vessel a year form the states and
that vessel is the barque "Horace
Sendder" of Boston. She is loaded
by her owner with the articles
mentioned and sundries comprising
for, land, clocks, biscuits tc.</p>
<p>She does not as a tule seell all her
cargo here. imber as a rule,
sells readily but is by no means
a certain sale. Soap and petrolium 
also</p>

<pb facs="Scan70006.jpg"/>

<p>also generally find a ready sale.
She takes from here drafts in pay, 
ment and on reaching Gaboon
after calling at intermediate ports
buys red-wood and loads with
that and what ebony she can
get, for the States. She left here
early in the year and we may look
for her again in November or
December. As had improves better
sales may be made, but not some
goods, or qualities of goods that are
frequently sent here. The idea seems
to prevait that the damaged and very
inferior goods are suitable enough
for this market. This is a mistake
and damages the reputation of 
the United States as a source of 
supply, and I have frequently 
complained</p>

<pb facs="Scan70007.jpg"/>

<p>complained to captains and
supercarges for so carelessly and
recklessly <unclear>injuring</unclear> the good <unclear></unclear>
and commercial reputation of
their country. I will <unclear>subitaniate</unclear>
my remarks by giving my frequent
experience in one article, flour
a considerable quantity is brough
in United States vessels from time
to time but is generally more or less
damaged, or of very inferior quality. 
The consequence is that instead of
finding a ready sale at good prices
it is with the almost difficulty 
that purchasers can be found
for small quantities at low prices
and this is used to mix with
Portuguese flour in small quan-
tities and to make very inferior
bread</p>

<pb facs="Scan70008.jpg"/>

<p>bread which is need for contacts
and prisoners rations.</p>
<p>Besides coffee a great quantity
of sugar cane is grown in the colony 
from which rum is distilled and is
an important article of <unclear></unclear>
trade, but little being imported
from other countries.</p>
<p>The differential duties make
direct trade with this province from 
other countries somewhat disad
rantagious, principally however
to the shipping interest in most
cales. These duties operate as
follows: On goods manufac-
tured in any other country than
Portugal and imported direct
form that country in other than
Portuguese vessels the whole amount</p>

<pb facs="Scan70009.jpg"/>

<p>of duty according to the tariffs 
partable. If, being of foreign manu-
facture, they pace through the cus-
tom house in Lisbon and are re-
shipped thence in Porgueuse Vessels
they pay 2% ad-valorence in Lisbon
and 70% here, of the duty. If as
Portuguese manufacture and shipped
in Portuguese vessels, they pay 
only 2% in Lisbon and 30% here.</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month
the anniversary of the birth of the
Prince Royal of Portugal, the
inauguration of the West African
Telegraph Cable look place, and
on or about the 16th of this month
the Railway from Loanda to Am-
baca will be inangurated. The 
contractor for the construciton of
the</p>

<pb facs="Scan70010.jpg"/>

<p>the line is M John Burnay of
Lisbon and Spop; the sub. con.
tractor bing Col: D.E. Davenport
 on American. at present here, and
having offices at 2 Moorgate St.
London. He is daily inpecting two
longe vessels from the states with
material for construction, and I 
can see no reason why merchants
and manufactures in the states,
of such goods as will be required
not only in construction but in
the maintenance of the line stations,
rolling stock and stores should
not compete for the furnishing
of same.</p>
<p>The agriculture of the country
is in the most primitive state still
and only on coffee and singer came
estates</p>

<pb facs="Scan70011.jpg"/>

<p>estates is some attention paid
to improvements and even there
much more might be done.</p>
<p>A very enterprising mission-
ary from the United States, Bishop
William Taylor arrived here some
two years ago with a few families 
and single people who are located
by the bishop in places chosen as
being suitable for farms and the
raising of live stock. He has got
int ploughs, materials for taming
and many other useful implements
the not only expects to make these
stations self supporting but also
as school for instructing the natives
and teaching them farming, lawing,
boat making, carpetering and
other industries and occupations.

<p>Hon James D. Porter
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to forward
to the Department the following.</p>
<p>Some years ago American
vessels had no difficulty in <unclear></unclear> a
sange of the produate of this province. A trade
was growing between the United States and
Angola gathering every day more and more
in importance, but unfortunately for its
continuance, our troubles at home sansed
its abandonment and, since then it has
never been resumed.</p>
<p>Europe</p>

<pb facs="Scan80027.jpg"/>

<p>Europe.</p>
<p>There are five lines of steamers
running from European ports to Loanda two
from England two from Portugal and one 
from Germany.</p>
<p>The Portuguese steamers are
subsidized. Leaving Lisbon on the 6th of 
every month, calling at Maduire, St. Vincent Ban-
ana, Princess Island, Ambria, Loanda, and
as far south as Massamedes, taking about seventy
days to make the round voyage.</p>
<p>The English steamers leave
Liverpool about every thrice weeks, taking about
three months to make the round trip.</p>
<p>The German steamers are
irregular, seldom going south of Loanda.</p>
<p>Besides the aboce, the
Deutch TRading Company have, a steamer
making abou tfive round trip a year.</p>
<p>The arrival of sailing
vessels from England, Portugal, Germany,
France, and Holland, are frequent, from the
United State and about every eighteen months.</p>
<p>The principal imports
from each country are, cotton grade
woolen</p>

<pb facs="Scan80028.jpg"/>

<p>woolen rade, hardware, crockery machinery
outlery, powder, guns, provisions tc, from
England; spirits, beer, guns, powder, hard-
ware tc, from Germany, flour pertrolium,
soap from America; wince, silks tc. from
France. Most of three goods are sent
to Loanda via Lisbon, re-exported from
Portugal in Portuguese vessels, there is a 
reduction in the import duties of 30 %.</p>
<p>The exports are bees' wax, coffee,
cotton, cattle, hides, dried fish, gums, ivory,
<unclear>indiarubber</unclear>, ails, archilla weed, palm
kennals sesame seed, tobacco and fibre.</p>
<p>Coffee is sent to Portugal.
Holland and Germany, cotton to England-
Portugal and Holland, hides to Portugal,
ivory, rubber, archilla weed oils, palm
kennals, sesame seed, and tobacco to England
and Portugal, cattle and dried fish to
French, and Portuguese dependencies.</p>
<p>The export duties is 3% on
shipments in Portuguese vessels and 5% in 
foreign vessels. The differential duties does
not, so much effect the manufacturing 
are</p>

<pb facs="Scan80029.jpg"/>

<p>as the shipping industries.</p>
<p>The promise of Angola is one of
the most important on the African Coast G
is rich in minerals and its soil is exceptionally
fertile.</p>
<p>Agriculture is in a progressive
condition. Large plantations of coffee, and
sugar cane owned by Europeans as well
as smaller once, cultivated by the natives, line
the many rivers that <unclear>ivigate</unclear> the country.</p>
<p>Whether the United States would 
be benefited by taking part in the trade of
this coast is worthy of consideration. There
are few, if any, articles imported into the
promise, which we do not produce as
cheap, if not cheaper, than any country
with whom we would have to compete, now
would we be more embarrassed by the
laws which regulate the collection of duties
than the most favored nation.</p>
<p>The city of Loanda contains
about fifteen thousand inhabitants one
thousand of these are white, mostly emercits,
carpentering brick laying, shoemaking,
tailoring, gorgshop keeping on the
common</p>

<pb facs="Scan80030.jpg"/>

<p>common, avocations.</p>
<p>The city is divided into a 
lower and an upper town. The upper
town is built upon a hill surrounding me
side of the lower town which nestles at its
base, along the shore, and it with the harbor
formed by the beautiful bay, are over
shadowed by the walls of Fort St Miguel
which perched upon a bola precipice at
the waters edge, protects the part.</p>
<p>Many large and important
public buildings are in efficient working
order; a creditable public market build-
ing is busily occupied during the day
by beyers and sellers; a custom house,
situated near the water-side and oppo-
site to a large structure belonging to
the Department of Public Works, offers
every convenience for the rapid transac-
tion of business. There are a number
of churches but they are sparsely attend-
ed except on special occasions, a large
hospital capelle of accommodating
eight hundred patients and harming
a full staff of efficient officers and
nurses.</p>

<pb facs="Scan80031.jpg"/>

<p>nurses, is most happily treated upon the hill.</p>
<p>The climate is unhealthy, many
deaths are caused by small-pox, a disease
common at the change of season. It is
impossible to learn how many die as the
records are very unreliable.</p>
<p>The streets of the lower city
are, as a ride, wide, but this and
settling into them from the higher land
has formed a deposit several inches in
depth of loose earth very hard to wall in.
There, are several well paved roads running
from the lower to the upper city, where
are the Governor's palace, the prison, the
barracks, the treasury, and other public 
offices, also an observatory where observation
of temperature, height of <unclear>tarometer</unclear>, tc. are
taken daily. The upper city, from being
exported fully to the sea breeze is the
healthiest part of the town.</p>
<p>There, are two newspapers
published, on weekly, one semi-weekly,
one is, an official bulletin and the
other is devoted to general news.</p>
<p>There is a fair military
found</p>

<pb facs="Scan80032.jpg"/>

<p>found which plays in a public garden
treated in the upper town, three times
a week, with the exception of this
there, are no public announcements.</p>
<p>Loanda is in telegraphic commu=
nication with Europe as well as with a 
number places in the interior. Telephone
in the city are in constant use.</p>
<p>The <unclear>Banco Nasional Ultramaino</unclear>
of Lisbon have a branch here as well as
others, at Massamedes, and Benguella. It is
largely interested in the sugar and coffee
growing industries, holding mortgages on
many plantations, an account of money
advanced to work the same.</p>
<p>Quite a large business is done
by the bank in the sale of its paper, are
a large general stove business is done here
and in the up country for a currency having
only a local value and with who a bank
paper is bought for use abroad.</p>
<p>Stores here with a stock of 
general merchandize, are numerous and

<p>Hon James D. Porter.
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to call the
attention of the Department to the fact that
that this Consular District extends from
Ambriz in 7o 49' to Cape Frio 18o
20' S. Lat, and from 13o E. Long. to 18o ELong.</p>
<p>By referring to dispatch No.
13. having same date as this it will be
seen that the commercial nations of Europe
consider that this country is worthy of atten-
tion. Confident of its future they are invent-
ing large same in opening the interior in
internal improvements, and in the cultivation
of its trade.</p>
<p>Whether it would be advantag-
eous to the United States for it to become
actively interested in this trade is a 
question</p>

<pb facs="Scan90002.jpg"/>

<p>to be decided by its merchants, but before
they, can so, decide it is necessary that
they should be thoroughly advised as to
the nature of the trade and the many
causes affecting it for now to them it is,
in a commercial since, almost an unknown
land.</p>
<p>The object of the Government in 
sustaining a <unclear>Bonsulate</unclear> here is <unclear>I pridge</unclear>, to
advance the commercial interests of it country.
That this can be close under the present arrange-
ment of thigns, it seems to me, is doubtful
unless information is given which will in-
fluence commercial action the problems, as
to who this trade should be cultivated by
our merchants, will long remain unsobed.</p>
<p>A residence of many years in
aprice has taught me that, to speak a <unclear></unclear>
and correctly of its trade, it is not well
to confide in the statements of ones <unclear></unclear>
and traders who decisions of presenting opposi-
tion, have no hesitation in using as a means
to that end, falsehood, but it is necessary that
that knowledge should be gained which is to 
be had only by personal examination.
The</p>

<pb facs="Scan90003.jpg"/>

<p>The difference in the habits, customs
and language of the natives of districts seperat-
est from one an other by only a few miles while
great. are not more pronounced than those which
are to be found in the lower animal life the
flora, the vegatation and the physical con-
formation of the country for instance, the
natives of one district superstitiously refuse to
gather certain products, yet the <unclear></unclear> adjoining
them use the same product as their principle
article of trade, that one class of vegatation is
not common to the country is evidence by
the fast that in certain districts nothing grows
but what giant of the forest, the "Bartab"
from which is taken a <unclear>future</unclear> known to commune
as <unclear>"Andasonia"</unclear>.</p>
<p>I hope that the Department will
convene with me in thinking that this Consulate
would be useful if it should be some actively
engaged in collecting such information as
would unable the Department ot consider with
the merchants of our country, those questions which
would determine the value of this trade with the
United States.</p>
<p>This cannot be done by a guest resi=
dence</p>

<pb facs="Scan90004.jpg"/>

<p>dence in Loanda, for the
people, the customs of the natives,
the vegatation and the trade
should be made a study at
their homes, and, at the places 
of supply.</p>
<p>I am aware of the great
amountof labor contained in
in the undertaking of this work,
as well as I am of the danger
which environs it because of
exposure and hostile natives.
but being to an extent familiar
with the general characteristics
of these people, and being more
or less inured to the unhealthy
climate, I have no hesitation in
saying that I feel that I am
fitted to enter into this work with
confidence in my capacity to
bring it to a successful con=
clusion; therefore, I have the
honor to respectfully request
that the Department will
issue such instructions, and 
make</p>

<pb facs="Scan90005.jpg"/>

<p>make such an allowance as will enable
me to proceed with this endeavor</p>
<p>In seeking this employment
I am influenced by the hope of being
able to make such a report as will
be of value in the eyes of our citizens
interested in commerce, and of
earning for myself the commenda=
tion of the Department.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obedient servant,

<pb facs="Scan90006.jpg"/>

<p>For</p>
<p>Mr. Rives:
Anola is a Portuguese colony and its trade
is monopolized as far as can in by tariffs and discrim-
inating duties, by Portugal. North of it lies the Bongo re-
gion, just now being worked by rarions European gov-
ernment. This suggests to me several reasons why it
would be like "shearing a hog" to attempt to open up any
trade in that region:</p>
<p>1. The differential duties of Portugal forbid competition</p>
<p>2. The <unclear></unclear> distance from Loanda to the U.S. places
our shippers at a disadvantage</p>
<p>3. It is impossible to make way against the <unclear>trunch</unclear>
(natural or <unclear>suesidized</unclear>) of the Germans, who
are seeking to found colonies in that part.</p>
<p>4. Our trade with Angola is <unclear></unclear> and I believe con-
sists only in some <unclear></unclear> perhaps a survival
of the <unclear>sliar</unclear> traffic.</p>
<p>5. No description of the physical character of the
country, or of the productions re-coned be of ser-
vice against such <unclear></unclear>. What <unclear></unclear> our
erted are easily procured indirectly through
England, Germany, &amp; Portugal.</p>
<p>6. The entire trade-- export and inport-- of Angola
does not exceed $3.000.000 a year.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to enclose line
with copy of a communication from Mr. Jos-
C. lark of the A.B. Missy Unions at Palabole
Station in the Congo Free State.</p>
<p>This matter has already been brought
under the notice of the Department thorough
disatch No. 33 under date of Sept 30 1887 and
copy of petition enclosed thereon.</p>
<p>By refusing to Consular Instructions,
Par 26 Page 10. I find that by the limitation
of jurisdiction this I marked is presented,
unless under speecial instructions from the Depart-
ment, from taking such action as would relieve
these United States citizens from the <unclear></unclear> of which
they complain.</p>
<p>It is to be deported that any 
of</p>

<pb facs="Scan90012.jpg"/>

<p>of the citizens of our great country should
find their-selves the objects of injustice and
wrong, but her much more soon there is
for right when it is remembered that these
people are not only Americans but are ex-
ponents of principles which should influence
all <unclear>christendom</unclear> to aid and protect them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on this coast right
unsupported by power is weak; indurvale
and associations thrive or suffer according
to the positions taken y their Governments
in securing to them their rights.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of exxperience african
residents that for the protectionof the citizens
of the United States who are now, or may
become, inhabitants of the Congo Free State
an agent from our Government should visit
this state at least once a year, and that 
the adoption of such a course would create
a moral influence sufficient to protect
the interverts of our citizens.</p>

would respectfully call the attention of

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to enclose
herewith copies and translations of letters
received at the Consulate from the
undermentioned commercial houses 
1. of this city, Viz: <unclear>Meisrs Newton Canne</unclear>
2. Mesor Baines <unclear></unclear> &amp; <unclear></unclear>

<p>Referring to inclosure No 1,
"Messrs Newton, Cainigil &amp; <unclear>Corticems</unclear> to me

although it bears the signature of the
form above mentioned, it is an emana=
tion of the individual. Mr Newton, who
is a Vice Consul of the United States,
But</p>

<pb facs="Scan90016.jpg"/>

<p>but I fancy to do it justice, it should
be read as coming from a consular
office of the British Government and
on English merchant jealous of opposi-
tion.</p>
<p>It appears singular that after the
many years Mr Newton has acted as
U.S. Consul here, that the first merchants
in the pace can say "that American
goods are not used because they are
not known," considering this, the fact
that he can see "no inducements for
American merchants tc," many find ex-
planation in his method of performing
the duties of U.S. Consul is for us they
relate to the extention of our foreign
trade.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the inclosure
above referred to, in its  treatment of
the subject under consideration either
does not graph its importance or is
influenced by a desire to discourage
neer departure It seems strange who,
that a successful merchant with
large expense in referring to</p>

<pb facs="Scan90017.jpg"/>

<p>causes affecting the commercial growth of a 
nation should allow his thought to be
confined to a question of these or four
years, or that he should limit himself
to the consideration of one product when
commenting upon the resources of a country
so rich in national agricultural and
manufactured product as ours.</p>
<p>Enclosure No 2: Missrs Bains Lauer &amp; Co-
interested in the growth of commercial re-
lation between this province and the U.S. 
adopt a time that earnes with it the
impression of honest expression and consider-
able study. I am unfortunately because
of limited experience, unable to judge
correctly as to the value of their ang0
gestions relation to the method to be
adopted to enable American Captial
to get a firm foothold in the part
of Africa, but, as far as knowledge
of the West Coast gives me a right to
judge of here. I think they are in 
some respects, right.</p>
<p>It is worthy of attention
that this firm in referring to cottons
would</p>

<pb facs="Scan90018.jpg"/>

<p>strengthen their statements by forwarding <unclear></unclear>
showing that if the U.S. desires to place
cotton on this market it will be necessary
for her manufactures to enter into a com=
petition of inferiority, but an examina=
tion of those used in the Northern districts
shows an improvement in quality enclose
"our honesty," allows us to manufacture
These samples with samples of coral
mentioned by this <unclear>firon</unclear> I have forward=
ed to the Department.</p>
<p>Inclosure No. 3- Messrs Pathavest Amares
in contradiction to Messrs Newton Conneq 
tC- though acquainted with only one 
of the products of our country- believe
that the introduction of American
commodities is to be denied.</p>
<p>Inclosure No. 4- Messrs Sonsa Lara
and Cs. have an experience limited
to yellow &amp; pitch pine.</p>
<p>Inclosure No. 5- Messrs Serart &amp; Co,
refer to England and Germany as the
countries of supply for this trade, ignor-
ant of our capacity, they seem to think
that our products are only such as
would</p>

<pb facs="Scan90019.jpg"/>

<p>would appeal to the requirements
of the European population, get they
believe, "American goods, may be introduc=
ed with advantage on this market."</p>
<p>Their letters are from of the
first commercial people of Loanda the
longest shippers and imports. It will
be <unclear>mergnized</unclear> that with one exception
they are remarkably unanimous in looking
at things in a narrow way, a comprehens-
ive view of the possibilities of the country
seems to beyond their ability or desire
and to any influence beyond those 
which affect small and immediate
<unclear>prenniary</unclear> returns they are dead.</p>
<p>The great nation of Europe 
find here, and in adjoining districts
valuable outlets for their industries 
taught by experience the value of repre-
sentation there is not a report of com-
mercial value on the coast where
English or German houses have not
planted their need. The factors with
which these countries have excused
these gratifying results, should not 
be</p>

<pb facs="Scan90020.jpg"/>

<p>be particular to them but ought to be
common to all alike. Commercial inter=
prise environed by good judgment is their
scent. American industries can find their
way into and seem a safe place in these
centres, if Americans will adopt the
methods as practiced by the English and
Germans. Resident representation coming
for contact with the natives leaning his
needs and securing an intimate knowledge 
of the trade- a supply of much <unclear>andise</unclear>,
steady in its flow and independent of
good and bad seasons alike, duiet
communication, cheap and rapid. Genius
these qualities it would be seen that
in a few years our increasing industries
I would find outlets in many parts of
the world where now the reports of
our country's industries and greatness 
are look upon a almost a romance.</p>
<p>To open the eyes of these people
to the vlue of our goods it is necessary
that some method be adopted to bring
them under their notice. This might
be done by the establishment here,</p>

<p>Sir:
In answer to your letter of the 1st
inst., we beg to reply as follows</p>
<p>We see no inducement for
American merchants to invest in the Angola
trade as there are too many houses already for
the trade and they would have every <unclear>eting</unclear>
against them. They would have no Aniet communic=
caiton and unless their good were shipped through
Lisbon they would have to pay the import duty which
is a difference of 30 %.</p>
<p>We do nothing with Amerian
goods although a few years ago we used ot have this
cargo a year. There is however a considerable quantity
of <unclear></unclear> timber imparted and this year these
<unclear>cangoes</unclear> have come from Pensacola, but now the port
is supplied for some time to come. We have given
up the trade ourselves as we found the <unclear>perfect</unclear>
to be too small to be worth the time and
trouble.</p>
<p>When the Railway is finished
we have not the slightest <unclear>d</unclear> but that
trade will greatly increase but that will take</p>

<pb facs="Scan90023.jpg"/>

<p><unclear></unclear> or four years at least. The annexed

Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:
In reply to your official letter asking
us for information relative to local on dets
for American products we have the honor
to inform you that we have made a special
study of this question and have for the
last ear exerted <unclear></unclear> to open up corres-
pondence on the subjct.</p>
<p>Doubtless you have consulted other
firms in our city and have become familiar
with the local idea that American 
products are limited to Lumber and
Petroleum.</p>
<p>We take it that you wish to have
a plain statement on our side of what
can be done and how to do it. The
matter is however a very complex one
and must be treated at length- for
our ground extends not only to this might for-
hood but to the North Coast and the
Congo River.</p>

<pb facs="Scan90026.jpg"/>

<p>Angola- Loanda-
Here very little has come in beyond Petroleum, lumber
and seasoned lets of <unclear>flirer</unclear> and soap.</p>
<p>Petroleum.- The consumption in Loanda: about 30 cases
of 10 gas each, few <unclear></unclear>= goo cases per month.
Now Redonds, Benguela, Missamedes, S. Home
and Banana: probably 2500 cases per month.
Donds and hte other lives and interior towns
another 16 or = 5000 cases of 10 gals. ea. per
month for this province. To resource a monopoly
of this trade it would be necessary to crush
competition, and to do this the aster ff would
have to be part <unclear>cif</unclear> in most of the ports men=
tioned @ this firles 1 $250. In Banana and
Cabinda better price resde. In Cabinda on
contrast with the Government is for <unclear>Rris</unclear> 1 $960
fun case. Custom duties in all entrese ports except
Banana and Cabinda, which are frce= 20
this per kilo.</p>
<p>Lumber- These are now five Loanda forms selling lumber
and we are awaiting a consignment from Norway.
Acassional lots, say 4 as time, would sell in 
about 3 months @ an average of <unclear></unclear> 25 $ or
per 1000 ft. new. If you wish we will
you preforms apeals. The duty is 110% ad. me

<p>Loanda
The one thing necessary for Angola trade
 is to just "somthing called soap"- hard, and
dark in color-- on this market at a maximum
of Reis 3 $oro per 55 cif Loanda con=
smption about 200 cases per month.</p>
<p>Flour.-- Fair quality such as that offered @ $3.50
to $4.00 in America should be put here cit
at $6.50 to $9.00. It sills well at about $8.00
in the customs- home. The comissomption in
Loanda and interior towns arrange 500

<p>The foregoing remark will serve to give you some
idea of the prospects offered in this province proper- Sir
views of the future, however, we have to consider the protable
commercial changes resultant upon the completion of the
Loanda and Amboa Railway.</p>
<p>The Railway <unclear>Selesie</unclear>,
evan originally formulated with the idea of opening
up the Lineage gold fields to the North of Golungo Alto.
Its value, however does not depend upon any speculative
enterprise but upon the natural resources of the <unclear>pernice</unclear>
The fertile dishists of Congo. Galingo alto. Engage tc.
producing coffee, <unclear>ribbon</unclear>, palm oil, <unclear></unclear> kennals tc. in great
abundance are practically coffed of their value by
the difficulties of transport.</p>
<p>At times carriers are not to be had to
the <unclear></unclear> ports, but were these no difficulty in this repeat
the excessive rates of the <unclear>companlia</unclear> da <unclear></unclear> 
would be sufficient to heavily handicap any enterprise.</p>
<p>We will give you the figures, <unclear>previewing</unclear> that
the produce is practically unlimited; given proper--
merchandise and copied transport the trade of
Angola would assume an importance it has never
yet <unclear>posscoed</unclear>. From Engone to Gonda- 5 days primary
Each carrier will take kilos of coffee, price per
carrier per trip  4 $000 ries. Therefore each ton of</p>

<pb facs="Scan90031.jpg"/>

<p>coffee requires 1/2 carriers and exists from Engone 
to Donda 58$ 000 less From Donda to Loanda
by the <unclear>Luanga</unclear> River Steams the fright is 40
ries per ton per kilametre- Donda is 200 kilametres
from Loanda, Ex. 200 x40= 5000 Reis x 50 100=66
about $70.00 per ton over 124 miles. The natural
emergence is that the interior plantations are
continually losing money and are all <unclear></unclear>=
to the Bank. Here gain we have the
secret of the falsified goods. Now all this
the Railway will remedy by tapping the <unclear>leayngo</unclear>
Galungo and Encange districts, malbing us to
mend our goods up cheaply and rapidly and get
our produce down <unclear>pender</unclear> equally advantage
circumstances.</p>
<p>The Railway will be built and will pay
well. It is however, at present in dubirus hands.
If things go wrong it may be five years before
the times franses Ouia: if not three years will
enable it to at least mitigate the into we have
mentioned.</p>
<p>The any the line will be built because
if the company fails in its obligation <unclear></unclear>
of African merchants is prepared to come forward
and <unclear></unclear> the thing through.</p>
<p>-District of the Congo-</p>
<p>We would rather not go into detail as to the River
Congo itself as we are of opinion that any <unclear>statement</unclear></p>

<pb facs="Scan90032.jpg"/>

<p>would fall short of the reality. we have,
however, powerful friend them, and if me could
go on a comprehensive visit try other much single
be arranged.</p>
<p>Outside of the Congo itself but within its
district we have outlets at Landana, Cabinda
and Ambrizette- not to mention S. <unclear></unclear> on the
Congo.- These places we supply under Government
Contracts with all kinds of promissions tc. tc.</p>
<p>In this district trade is essentially differ-
ent to that of Angola proper- goods are only partial=
ly adultenated and falsified and these is yet
a good field for American Cottons of the lowest
quality. In Cabinda alone we can guarantee
150 tons of produce per month and with a few
more homes in the <unclear></unclear> river we <unclear></unclear> doubt
that it could be quadrupled as merchants 
that it could sell you about 100 tons per month- <unclear></unclear>
@ 400 reis per 52$- not to mention aplended hand
woods in any quantity.</p>
<p>Such produce is all bought in barter for=
Cotton as per samples- <unclear></unclear> 40" under x 24 400 + <unclear></unclear>
Handkerchiefs in  price of one dozen. Best sales, blue
copies, ducks, <unclear></unclear> and red calies.</p>

<p>Red Corals as per samples. To resist best and

<p>Keg powder. 2+4</p>
<p>Here also can be sold regular lots of flour, <unclear></unclear>
since, short, and sundry other article which we will
advise later. Products are <unclear></unclear>, palm oil,
Rubber and ground nuts, <unclear></unclear> think <unclear></unclear> that
a little pusihng might arrange for a fiar
quantity of ivory.</p>
<p>Estimated capital for this enterprise
or for a concerns establishing and stocking
ten (10) factories= $60.000 No American
labor required not timber construction.</p>
<p>In conclusion we are of opinion that for 
American to be a drantageously represented in
Africa it is necessary that:-</p>
<p>A company be formed in American with at least
$200.000 Capital.</p>
<p>That an energetic and pushing <unclear></unclear> be
appointed a African Manager with a "good
interest"- acting under supervision.</p>
<p>That the company own at least 4 sailing
vessels of from $50 to 400 tons trader and
that these seem regularly between the two
countries: <unclear></unclear> the way for steam
communication.</p>
<p>Given <unclear></unclear> conditions it is easy for
American products to obtain a form fasting</p>

<pb facs="Scan90034.jpg"/>

<p>in African and for America to <unclear></unclear> that
position as regards African which a one of the
most important nation of the world she has
only exert himself to command.</p>
<p>We would also call your attention to the
fact that there are some hundreds of <unclear></unclear> register-
ed in the Secretarial of this town: including
gold, coal, petroleum, copper, and other valuable
minerals. In Cabinda we have copper, lead
and <unclear></unclear> in great profusion, and were informed
by the Government sometime since that time exerts
every indication of coal.</p>

<p>We are of opinion that the

<p>Loanda- Nov. 10. 18887.</p>

<p>Sir:
We beg to acknowledge your favor
of the 4th inst., and have much pleasure in replying
to your various question.</p>
<p>The commerce of the United States,
altho' of great importance in death, has only
manifested itself on a very small <unclear></unclear> in our
possession of Angola,- seeing principally to the
limit4ed market we have for any article not <unclear></unclear>
by proper for the native trade.</p>
<p>This branch of manufacture
has been held by England from the outsel and
include <unclear>such</unclear> article as <unclear>saw</unclear> and strifed cotton
fabrics, crocking, greens (flintlook), and powder--
We are not aware as to who ther America can
compete in this line: the one <unclear></unclear> fact being
that the English and German market are
drawn upon exclusively-</p>
<p>As to other goods for the <unclear></unclear>
tion of the European population their importance
is relatively insgnificant. We may however
remark:-</p>
<p>1- We believe that American goods
may be introduced with advantage on our
market.</p>
<p>2- The principal articles which
have been handled by us in dealing with
America, have been pitch <unclear></unclear> petroleum
<unclear>soap</unclear></p>

<pb facs="Scan990003.jpg"/>

<p><unclear>soap</unclear> and furniture.</p>
<p>Of these we have received consignments from 
Wilmington. It is however necessary to note that
petroleum and soap shipped dined- cannot
compete in price with the same articles via Europe.
Petroleum in direct lots costs about double the
price of European shipments.</p>
<p>We have every hope that the commerce
of Angola will sooner or later improve in tone
<unclear></unclear> principally to the Loanda + Ambaca
Ry Scheme.</p>
<p>As we have already observed our relation
with the United States have been limited and
it has only been in timber that any real
business ha been done.</p>
<p>We remain

Yours respectfully,

<p>Sir,

Joaquin has been appointed governor general
of Angola and arrived here by the last mail
Steamer from Fishon, he is accompanied by his
wife, and <unclear></unclear></p>
<p>Governor Amaral is as I must Judge by his
friendly reception of me and by the good makes
he has towards American, determined to help
the Americans traders and commence on this
Coast. A railroad is much needed, and a 
free grant of Land for 99 years can be
obtained by any American Company <unclear>selling</unclear>
to <unclear></unclear> some Capital; The country is very
rich but has no developments, In all the

that a nature so well know would still
keep what sguandrons in countries and

war was needed at least twice a year
on this coast. his Excellency Ideas on this
matter is supported by every one I Imaw,
and in my conversation with several
natives chiefs and trades on this coast
I have been told the following.</p>
<p>"You call yourself a representative of a great
country were all kinds of goods abound,
but where are they? You say that your
nation is greater and larger then
Holland, France, England, how can
you prove it to us; the English have

<p>Sir
I have the honor to state that by report secured from the
Consular agent at Mossamedes that the Am: Whaling
Aks Hercules <unclear>"Capt. S. Isae Smis" and "Milton"</unclear>Capt
J.B. Bolten were at that port during the month of
October also that the milton ran on shore <unclear>hsoirce,</unclear> but
got off alright. Mossamedes was infected also with
small pox. The report from Benguela is only
inentionning that several of the Am: <unclear>missrioranis</unclear>
from <unclear>Balinbu</unclear> were at Bengela buying some goods
to Barter in the interior. The consul agent as
Ambry informs me of the arrival of Mr. Baxter
Am, Am MIssionar from Gaboon who came there by
reason of ill health, heside writting the following <unclear></unclear>
"Am: trading vessels may be said to have ceased
ruming to this part of the coast altogether with
their usual cargo such as lumber, tobacco, cam
Far jaja. But there is another important hanch
of our trade, and I have no doubt whatever
if the matter is properly locked into, it
might eventually lead to the opening.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0155.002.jpg"/>

<p>up of an extensive commerce.</p>
<p>I mean the manufacture of common ordinary cloths
suitable for this trade, suck as greys and shipped
Domestics, why cannot the Americans mills
compete with the Manchester, and with the cotton
ready to their hands. Some few years ago, they
did compete successfully with Manchester; actually
exporting Am: made greys to Manchester for sale!
I am at a loss to know why this was never <unclear>encausing</unclear>
unless the Manchester new cut their prices of me
that it discouraged the American manufactures
from preserving. Should you deem my idea
of any value, I shall be glad to forsaid you
samples of goods indicated, and would feel
desirous of knowing as what pries in English
currency they could be delivered to Liverpool for
reshipment; or bought and dried from the U.S."</p>

<p>Hon: W. Hunter
Assty. Secty. of State.
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to acknowledge the recipt of
your dispatch No. 10, in regard to Agents appointed
by me would <unclear>appnored</unclear> by the Hon: Secty. of State;
it was and still is with the intention of promoting
Am: Commerce in this part of the world, beside
putting a stp to runaway seaman, for abuse
received on board Am: <unclear>Whloers</unclear>: and while
enforcing the U.S. Law over this jurisdiction, to 
give prompt justice to seamen, masters or officers.</p>
<p>"Mossamedes" will in a few years become important
large fields of wheat, corn, sugar cane, and
cotton are now in cultivation.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Govt. is organizing small colonies
all over that district, The Buiers in "Whillah"
and "Humpata" on cutting <unclear>confornitly</unclear> with
the Portuguese a route from the interior; so
that this crops, and the result of their hunting,
such as, Hides, ivory, &amp; ostrich feathers, can
be carried to Mossamedes; These colonies
as well as the Buiers;- and even the natures
of the interior who seem to fallow now the</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0157.003.jpg"/>

<p>example of the Boers- will soon want
farming implements; and I do not
know of any to be compared with those
of the U.S. for simplicity, <unclear>denability</unclear> and
cheapness.__ The merchants and large
land builders will ne also steam
wills, and other machinery for making
Rum, Sugar, grinding corn and wheat,
cleaning and pressing cotton ja.ja.</p>
<p>A,: Whalers seem to make their head quarters
now at not place, "although the best inducements
have been granted to them by the Portuguese govt.
at Loanda.</p>
<p>I understand what nine whalers were
there during the last two months. From the
"Eliza Adams" three seamen ran away, and
from the "Alice Knowles" a man was discharged
by reason of sickness; these seamen have
been sent to me from Mossamedes at a
great expense, and I find myself compelled
to keep them until I am able to foward
them to Santeago "Cape de Verde" by mail steamer
which only takes them occasionally, more
as a <unclear>javor</unclear> although I pay to the Capt
5.0.0 for each man.</p>
<p>M.J.L. Iovies that I appointed until
appnored by the Hon: Secty. of State is the
largest merchant of Mossamedes, a young</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0157.004.jpg"/>

<p>Man, full of energy, and ambitions to
promote the commerce and development
of Mossamedes.</p>
<p>It is upon close inquiryk as to his
capacity, integrity capabilityja.ja. that
I appointed him. If the state Dept has
any objections to these appointments, I
will notify them at  once as not having
been accepted by the state Dept.</p>
<p>I have never seen either of the gentlemen
at Amby, Benguella, Mossamedes;
but I am confident that an agent is
needed at Mossamedes for the interest
of Am: Seamen and others visiting that
port</p>
<p>I have the honor to be

<p>Sir
I have the honor most respectfully to state that
Capt. of Frigate; Ferreria do Amaral <unclear>Franirsed</unclear>
Joaquin has been appointed governor general
of Angola and arrived here by the last mail
steamer from Fishon, he is accompanied by his
wife, and me aid de Canip.</p>
<p>Governor Amaral is as I must Judge by his
friendly reception of me and by the good wishes
he has towards Americans, determined to help
the Americans traders and commerce on this
Coast. A railroad is much needed, and a 
free grant of Land for 99 years can be
obtained by any American company willing
to <unclear></unclear> some capital; the country is very
rich but has no developments, In all the
reports I am now collecting and my own
personal judgment which will be fowarded
to the State Department for my quarter
ending December 1882 You will be able
to see what a R.R. company here</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0160.002.jpg"/>

<p>would be able to realize in 10 years, a 
great profit would consequently be the
result and new spirit put in this wealthy
but forgotten country.</p>
<p>Governor Amaral while talking to me
about Americans, its commerce, trade,
goods mentioned that it was strange
that a nature so well know would still
keep whole there was no need of such
and that in his belief on am: man of
war was needed at least twice a year
on this coast, his Excellency Idea on this
matter is supported by every one I know,
and in my conversation with severals
natives chief and trades on this coast
I have been told the following,</p>
<p>"You can yourself a representative of a great
country were all kind of goods abound,
but where are they? You say that your
nation is greaer and larger then
Holland, France, England, hour can
you prove it to us; the English have
plenty men of was along this coast.
Dutch, French, and English goods one
daily coming by the English mail
and others merchants vessels. on the</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0160.003.jpg"/>

<p>Coast you see nothing but English Trading
Houses, and the goods we are now wearing
on English; Why then if your country is so
Big as you mention and has so much fine
goods <unclear></unclear> powder that you do not
bring some to us to see, and trade: why
do you not put in our country Americans
trading Houses, we will give them land
and Houses; protect them, and he <unclear></unclear>
to them, and if you have such great
ships as England has <unclear>meet</unclear> big games;
why not let us see them"--</p>

In consideration of the unhealthy state of

<unclear></unclear> the Depart of State for a standing
permission to leave this consulate in charge

<p>Sir
I have the honor to state that by report receied from the
Consular agent at Mossamedes that the Am: Wahling
Aks. "Hercules" Capt. <unclear>J. Iwae Swis</unclear> and "Millton" Capt
J.B. Bolten were at that port during the month of
October also that the Milton raw on there <unclear></unclear>, but
got off alright. Mossamedes was infected also with
small pox. The report, from Bengula is only
mentioning that  severals of the Am: Missiourians
from Balinbu were at Benguela buying some goods
to Barter in the interior. The Consul agent at
Amby informs me of the arrival of Mr. Baxton
Am Missionary from GAboon. who cam ethere by
reason of ill health lend writting the following Oif:
"Am: trading vessels may be said to have ceased
running to this part of the coast altogether with
their ausual cargo such as lumber, tobacco, corn
For s.s. But there is another important <unclear></unclear> 
of our trade, and I have no doubt whatever
if the matter is properly looked into it
might eventually lead to the opening</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0162.002.jpg"/>

<p>up of an extensive commerce.</p>
<p>I mean the manufacture of common ordinary clots
suitable for this trade, such as greys and stripped</p>
<p>Domestics, why cannot the American Mills
compete with the Manchester, and not the cotton
ready to their hands. Some fear years ago, they
did compete successfully with Manchester; actually
exporting Am: made greys to Manchester for sale!</p>
<p>I am at a loss to know why this was never encouraged
unless; the Manchester new cut their price of one
that it discouraged the American manufactures
from persevering. Should you deem my idea
of any value. I shall be glad to forward your
samples of goods indicated, and would feel
desirous of knowing at what price, in English
currency they could be delivered to Liverpool for
<unclear></unclear> or brought ou dried from the U.S.</p>
