October 18th 1882</p>
<p>I swam on shore and deserted the
distance from the ship to the shore
was about 1 3/4 miles. The cause of
my running away from the vessel
was brutal treatment from the 
3rd mats the Joe <unclear>Linish</unclear> he being
encouraged by the other officers
and Capt. ordering him to have me
we beaten. I served six months
on said vessel and found it impossible
to hear the abuse any longer.
I ran away and hid myself in the 
bushes until the vessel left
port, and when I went to report 
myself to the Consular Agent</p>

is to return home, I am sorry
that I ran away, but I beg to
state that the ill treatment I 
received on board for six months
was more than man could hear;
I am here to  bare footed having
only the jumper and that

I only received from the master
the sum of $36 00/100 n ach, that I 
never refused duty while on board 
and was sent on shore at Lile-Fish

on account of sickness. While on
shore here the Consular Agent
took good care of me <unclear>rentone</unclear>
to a boarding house until the
Portuguese Steamer left for Loanda,
and  that the Consular Agent
paid any passage to this Consulate.</p>
<p>The Consular Agent gave me 13

Mossamedes, I now have in my 
possession $12 when I was sent on
shore by the Capt. order I did not
sign clear of the Articles, but the </p>

<p>Capt. gave me this letter "Letter Enclosed"
to the owner of New Bedford.</p>
<p>The agreement mile-the master was

a barrel full for every go on
land. From the slop chest I received
only $15.25. I was laid up 3 1/2
weeks sick on shore at Mossamedes
waiting the arrival of the Portuguese 
mail Steam ship for this port.</p>
<p>I never signed or put any mark 
to any kind of paper or document;
she Capt. told me tat I would
receive on my arrival at New Bedford
$9.00 for my shore, which I think is 
specified in the letter he gave me
