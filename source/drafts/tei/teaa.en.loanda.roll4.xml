"Mossamedes" on Lile-Fish Bay 
October 18th 1882</p>
<p>I swam on shore and deserted the
distance from the ship to the shore
was about 1 3/4 miles. The cause of
my running away from the vessel
was brutal treatment from the 
3rd mats the Joe <unclear>Linish</unclear> he being
encouraged by the other officers
and Capt. ordering him to have me
we beaten. I served six months
on said vessel and found it impossible
to hear the abuse any longer.

bushes until the vessel left
port, and when I went to report 
myself to the Consular Agent</p>

received on board for six months
was more than man could hear;
I am here to  bare footed having

under oath, that I have been on
board of said Alice Knowles for
about 3 1/2 years, during which time
I only received from the master
the sum of $36 00/100 n ach, that I 
never refused duty while on board 
and was sent on shore at Lile-Fish
Bay on "Mossamedes" by the Capt
on account of sickness. While on
shore here the Consular Agent
took good care of me <unclear>rentone</unclear>

Portuguese Steamer left for Loanda,
and  that the Consular Agent

to the owner of New Bedford.</p>
<p>The agreement mile-the master was

a barrel full for every go on
land. From the slop chest I received
only $15.25. I was laid up 3 1/2
weeks sick on shore at Mossamedes
waiting the arrival of the Portuguese 
mail Steam ship for this port.</p>
<p>I never signed or put any mark 
to any kind of paper or document;

receive on my arrival at New Bedford
$9.00 for my shore, which I think is 
specified in the letter he gave me

I have the regret to state that the named

hours.</p>
<p>I also was decently buried by this consulate
in the English or Protestant Cemetery, not
having been aft to more than he was
a Catholic, which is my forny believe he was
being of Portuguese origin; the remainder
of his flothing not intened with him
consisted of one waleu blanket, one
pu and one overhaul my burned

St. Paul de Loauda 
Jany. 10th 1883</p>

<p>Hon: John Davis
Asst. Secty. of State
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir
Having been compelled to change air by season
of continued sickness, I made a letter ship up
the Luanga river as far as Douda which took
me 9 days.</p>
<p>The Luanga river form the South-eastern
boundary of the Portuguese <unclear></unclear> of Angola
although it is claimed by them to possess
the whole country from Latt. South 5 to 
Latt South 19. The source of the Laurga is
unknown as yet.</p>
<p>From Donda to the Bar, is the great
Commercial highway of Angola, but
only navigable for small crafts, the
control of said River by steam navigation
was obtained by the late Mr. Silva the U.S.
commercial agent,and has been kept
here since <unclear>wilder</unclear> the name of "Luanga 
Steam Navigation" That grant will
expire shortly and leave open, to some
enterprising American a gold field 
of <unclear></unclear> value. </p>

<pb facs="Scan10020.jpg"/>

<p>Trade of all sorts is very brisk at the 
different factories on the right bank of
the river, the left on eing still in the
hands of the naturies, who will allow us
<unclear></unclear> to settle there: Au exception is
the small fortress and few Catholic channels
now almost in ruin of Muscina, held
by the Portuguese; but no trade comes to that place.</p>
<p>Donda may be called the heart or capital
of the interior of the Provence of Angola, 
to Dons, the Portuguese traders and
planters of Cafengo, Golimgo-Alto, Ambaca
Pungo-Andongo, and Malango seud
they coffee, <unclear>wang</unclear> Rubber, <unclear>Lrary S.S.S.</unclear>
to the shipped to Loanda</p>
<p>It is to Dondo only that the natires
from the right bank of the Luanga bring
their gindula, palm oil, hides ursella
S.S.S., to be bartered for cloth, powder, 
arms, rum, and <unclear>guincailleries</unclear>.</p>
<p>The two seasons, are as follows; the winter
begins from June to the middle of October
and summer from middle of October
to the beginning of June.</p>
<p>In winter also called "the dry season"
there is no rain, but heavy dense during
the night, and with the sun generally</p>

<pb facs="Scan10021.jpg"/>

<p>covered by clouds until 9, 10, and 11 a.m.
the temperature is agreeable, the thermometer
seldom rising above 23 : in the shade;
the summer or rainy season, is more properly
divided into two season: :the small rans
and the big rains" on the 18th of October when
we part the sun in our length, small
showers begin to fall in the afternoon until
the 22d. of December when the sun attains
its greatest southern declination, from
that date until the 24th of February, when we
again have the sun in any length, the 
weather remains changeable, while in March
and April the rains come down in
torrents of sometimes twelve and sixteen
hours duration, inundating the country
and swelling the rivers.</p>
<p>The banks in the river as well as the bar
shifts yearly after the raining season is over
owing to the strong current occasioned
by the heavy rain. During the dray season
offoo tede is felt as far as Bom Jesus
while in the rainy seasons a current
runs constantly down with a velocity 
of from 4 1/2 knots at Dando, and
1 1/2 knots at the Bar.</p>
<p>The climate on the banks of the river is 
<unclear></unclear> healthy, fever and liver complaints</p>

<pb facs="Scan10022.jpg"/>

<p>being the prevailing diseases especially in the 
raining months. The Laundaries full of fish,
alligators and hippopatami; when the river has
overflowed its banks and <unclear>susides</unclear> again ino
its awashed, the effuria from the <unclear></unclear> becoming
very dangerous to <unclear></unclear> as well as tto the
waters caustifatious </p>
<p>It is remarkable that the natures suffer as
more from seven <unclear>thew</unclear> the Europeans, by reason
I henese of their mode of living, which is
entirely on farmiha, and Lula, and paisace
themselves with the vile shift called rum, on trade
<unclear>qui</unclear> importd by European trades.</p>
<p>In Calengo, Penigo-Audorego, Golingo-allo and
Ambaca, feres are almost unknown, while the 
climate of :Malenge" is almost European, whear
gearing, and being cultivated rain with great 
success.--</p>
<p>Two years ago a terrible epidemic of small pox
decimated the nature populatoire, while not a
single European was attacked by it--
In case of sickness a nature generally distrusts
European treatment and medicines, but prefers
to be slonly doctored to death by his own country-
men and superstitious</p>
<p>When dead the common negro is buried
anywhere, maybe, a few yards from the door 
of his cabata, or in the middle of the road</p>

<pb facs="Scan10023.jpg"/>

<p><unclear>this</unclear> or nature chiefs, are <unclear>intoed</unclear> with more ceremony.
For three months the couple is kept ashore the grained
sitting in a chair, and daily enveloped in new
pieces of cloths, which are robbed during the
night by his former subjects After this lapse
of time, he is deposited in his gare two
grown up <unclear>slares hemo</unclear> decapitated and their
bodies entered with him, as well as a 
boy and a girl "both alive" the former holding
the Jaba's here and the other a <unclear></unclear> with
water; Although it have never been an eye
witness of this barbarism, and thought it
is officially contradicted, I do form by
believe that it is still practiced, and
would have gone with my informant to
one of these Burials; if I had been well
and had time to spare-</p>
<p>Another barbarism, not yet abolished
is judgment by fetish: which I have
witnessed more than fifty times on the
Well J.S. West Coast previous to the present 
rig: The accused, to show his innocence
deliberately swallows a certain amount
of deadly <unclear>regetatle</unclear> poison, if he vomits
it, he is innocent! but if his stomach
retains it he is guilty of the crime 
imputed to him, and dies--</p>
<p>When a Jaba dies, his successor is not

<pb facs="Scan10024.jpg"/>

allowed to continue the works which the deceased
may have begun, or to inhabit his residence, nor
does he inherit his fortune, plate or anything
on the county, where emmorable good,
Hauses J. belonging to the deceased, are allowed
to fall into <unclear>reim</unclear> while all morable goods
are robbed by his subject immediately after
death.' For a whole year the limit of the 
deceased is supposed to reign, his
successor having no power whatever, the
whole king down or the remaind, therefore,
in a state of anarchy.</p>
<p>The antignated custom impedes to a great
extent the prosperity of the nature <unclear></unclear>
as whatever are regent may have done
for his people, this successor is obliged to 
annihilate.</p>
<p>to Doudo, th most important places
on the Lauanga are "Massangano" (fortous trade and 
Cane plantattions on the Lucala.) "Boca de 
Gyarga" (trade principaly palm oil <unclear>fihe</unclear>and
live stock) "Coffeecaulba" (trade prinicaplly 
coffee, palm oil and rock jaln.) "Cumga" (trade
principally cotton and <unclear>fihe</unclear> "Bom Jesus" Laange

<p>I have the honor to state that by the British
mail S.S Bosmy which arrived on the 11th
hint I new a young boy and a girl all
from Dons, and who accompanied the
German explores Luist Weissmann in
craddling Africa have Loanda; have returned
in good health, they report that their 
voyage across was very pleasant, and
that they never had nay troubles with
the natives of the interior-that aco
the chiefs recovered very well; although
they had no prospects to give them--
and that from tribe to tribe they
were accompanied by some chiefs. They
went to Laugilar where they were put
on board the British S.S. Chittagong
with about 250 more landibariaus
under the command of a Belgian
called Capt. Combier, for Mr. Henry 
Mr. Stanley expedition and more 
landed at Banana on the Congo.</p>

<pb facs="Scan10028.jpg"/>

<p>and proceeded at once to Mr. Henry M.
Stanley Head quarter.</p>
<p>The British mail S.S. Bosmy brought
Mr. Weissman followers here.</p>
<p>The strong impression here is: that a great 
disturbance is expected on the upper
Congo very soon.</p>
<p><unclear>Elern New German Haus</unclear> have established
themselves <unclear>betureeu</unclear> Gaboon and anbryette
and it is reported that another monthly 
line of steamer from Hamburg will <unclear></unclear>
betureeu thath place and the West cop
as far as ambryette. Fire Belgeans hauses
are also established since their arrival 
here--</p>
<p>With the expectations of the troubles in
the interior, the <unclear>Liory</unclear> and others produce
have been keep back, and fright on the
coast very hard to be obtained for the
present which leave some of the large
commuist merchants in a very bad
state and I am expecting daily to
hear of some failured in Loanda.</p>
<p>I would be in my opinion the best
moment for Americans enterprising
mad from some good from in America
to come and start four trading ports
on the Coast and making its head</p>

Am: goods a form <unclear>Cace</unclear> triple her capital
in <del></del> years. But they must recollect that
Americans coming here, must have a good
knowledge of the Portuguese language.</p>
<p>With this qualification, of course, a thorough
<unclear>lusined</unclear> man would soon become familiar
with the hussiness methods of the place,
peculiarities aftereffs S.S.</p>
<p>I would <unclear></unclear> state that Vice Consul
Robert L. Neuton has returned form 
England as the British Vice Consul, and
has not yet reported himself come.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to enclose herewith the Doctor's
certificate ordering me to go further North or
South to improve my health, which has 
been, I must confess, very bad indeed for
over three months. It seems that I came 
live here much longer if I do not change
air: Consequently I would most <unclear>respectfully</unclear>

able, will certainly take note of what 
may be useful to Am: commerce.</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to state that
Dispatch M: 12 is received and contents
carefully noted, for which I thank the 
Department.</p>
<p>I have been following a real slave
business going on here and carried
out by Portuguese from Lisbon and 
both whites and <unclear>innlattos</unclear> of this 
country. I wanted and still
intend to follow them on that business
up to the near interior where the 
purchase is effected by Barter, <unclear></unclear>
as is the case, I am told, throughout
almost all the trading posts, not
only of the interior but near the sea-
board and rivers: Such is the case
at the most important tour of
Danda on the Luanza never: Ambrig
and

<pb facs="Scan10039.jpg"/>

and specially at the southern
ports of Benguella and Catumbellla
where large <unclear>casarans</unclear> of two and
three thousand Negros are constantly
arriving from the interior bringing
along with their produce numbers
of young blacks for sale or barter; 
they average in ages from infancy 
to full grown adults, and always
find a ready market with trick
competition.</p>
<p>From the small seaport of clovo=
Redondo South of Loanda, an export
trade has been regularly carried
on for more than five years by
the agents and on account of the 
Bank Alltramarine of Lisbon. The
agent form this port is a cll.
Batrices Alvares, and although cer-
tain formed are caused out as pres-
cribed by their emigration land,
it is well known that as soon
as they are landed at St. Thomas,-
and that by the hundreds-they
are treated, conducted and consi-
dered

<pb facs="Scan10040.jpg"/>

dered as slaves; and not one
has ever been known to have re-
turned, and most probably never
will be.</p>
<p>But I have been now for a 
long time very sick, and this
month hardly able to write, even-
tully wife Mrs. du Verge has lift
for the United States via Liverpool:
she has with her a live specimen
of slave traffic in Africa; a stolen
child given to her by a respectable
white merchant for the simple rea-
son that she was too young to be
sold.</p>

<p>To the Commander of the French War and
To anchor in Loango</p>
<p>Sir,
Having heard from <unclear></unclear> whitemen, that you
had, or overe going to take possession of this county, in the name
of the French Government, and having heard also that the nations
in that case would out of revenge, attack, plunder, and destroy
the several trading house in the place, and after words take to the
bash, I undersigned a citizen of the United States of North America
doing business in this pace, and in other pints near here, having Amer-
ican and British properly incharge, find myself obliged to adress
you the following consideration.</p>
<p>That it is almost certain that as soon as the Natives find
out that you are taking possession of their country, they will out of
revenge, attack factories, and plunder and destroy everything. Thus
entailing ruin on innocent traders, who have nothing whatever to do
with these questions.</p>
<p>The presence of your vessel willn ot deter them from 
so doing, as they will very likely make a right attack, and by make
it general preclude the possibility of the white men helping each 
other.</p>
<p>That as soon as they have plundered and destroyed the
Factories, killing very likely also some of the white men, they will
take ot the Bush, as the <unclear>lors</unclear> of their villages is as nothing to them, making
it impossible to find and punish them.</p>
<p>Considering the Circumstances, the Undersigned
thinks it incumbent to him, as a citizen of the United States

<pb facs="Scan20001.jpg"/>

of American, as proprictor and Agent, having American and British
property in charge, to formally protect against you and the
Fred. Government individually and collectively, for any loss or
damage that may accrul to him. Through any, through any 
acts caused by yours or by the French Government orders,
including additional experiences and loss of time or any other damage
direct or indirect.</p>
<p>Hoping that you will take due notice
of this my formal protest, (a copy of which will be fon-
ded to the American Consuls at Gabon and Loanda)
and that you will kindly send me an acknowledgement
of his receipt, I remain with the greatest consideration.</p>
<p>Most Respectly, 
Your Obedt Serant

Washington. }</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honour to lay 
before the Department of State the 
following circumstances connected
with the discharge of my duties as 
Vice Consul for the United States at
this port.</p>
<p>Mr. L de R du Verge left
Loanda for the Congo on the 16th
<unclear>ultins</unclear> by the Portuguese mail steamer
for the purpose it is reported, of
ammanging with Mr. Stangley the
details of the duties of a post he has
accepted under the Belgian Expedition
without handing over to me the <unclear>arbives</unclear>
of the consulate or acquainting one
as to whether I should be able to 
have access to any documents or
<unclear>forins</unclear> which might be required,
alothough I saw that officer on the
day of his departure.</p>
<p>Had there been no immediate con-
sular

<pb facs="Scan20005.jpg"/>

duties to perform I should have worked
the <unclear>resurce</unclear> of Mr. du Verge for an explanation,
and also for an explanation in a matter
of a personal nature which has recently
come to light.</p>
<p>The facts of the case are these: on
the arrival on the 3rd instant of the
wrecked crew of the American whaler
"Merlin", last Santh of Alassmedes,
I called at the house of Mr. T. Mark, 
a Swiss holding a Dry Goods retailed
shop, where Mr. du Verge has hired a
room as his precedence and office. Mr.
Marh who possesses the key gave me per-
mission to enter but would not permit
me to lake the shipe reguler as thee
archives, he said, were left in his charge,
and I am unable to register my correspond-
ence in the proper official book which 
appeared to be locked away.</p>
<p>Wishing to take to my office the
ships register did not appear to me any
infraction of the rules, or had Mr. Mark
any official regled or authority to interfere
with me, for in the firck place the room
offered no facilities, for writing and in the</p>

<pb facs="Scan20006.jpg"/>

<p>Second I could not without great
inconsciousnce to myself obtain the
assistance of my mercantile clerk
to write up the register.</p>
<p>That Mr. Mash, who does not
possess the highest reputations for
soberuss or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the arch-
ives and <unclear>experintend</unclear> my actions over
them, shows a want of official con-
sideration by Mr. du Verge, and moreso
contrary to the consular instructions.
Under these circumstances and not poss-
essing the key of the rover, no <unclear>reeponci-
bility</unclear> can be attached to me for the
safety of the consular papers but I shall
endeavour to <unclear></unclear> such supervision
over them as is consistent with my
relations wiht Mr. Marti.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that there
wish a difference between Mr. du Verge
and myself but such is not the case,
if his friendly pretensions are to be con-
sidered as a proof of his sincerity, and I 
am quite at a loss ot understand what 
motive he has to pass me over in matter</p>

<pb facs="Scan20007.jpg"/>

<p>appertaning to the consular, with
which I have been connected for a long
period, having been appointed to my
present position since 1868, and for 
may years have been in note charge
of the office, without, I venture to state
giving the Department any cause of 
complaint or in any way fialed to 
discharge the duties faithfully and 
consientiously.</p>
<p>I may also state that my long 
residence here as merchant, and
holding the post of British Vice
Consul whihc I presume is not incom-
patible with my position as United 
States Vice Consul, give me a status
that facilitates considerably the settlement
of consular business with the loeal
authorities with whom I have always 
been on the most friendly and inti-
mate relationship.</p>
<p>The information that has been given
me regarding myself personally is that
Mr. Martin has failed to obtain any one
here to sign a bond for him to be Vice
Consul of Loanda form which I infer 
that</p>

<pb facs="Scan20008.jpg"/>

<p>that Mr. du Verge has applied to the 
Department to have me substituted,
but on what ground I am unable
to say.</p>
<p>In submitting the foregoing
matter for the information of the 
Department, I have te honour to
request thtat should there be no
reason why I shoulld not continue
to hold the post of Vice Consul, that
Mr. du Verge hsould be instructed
to consing the arclive of the Con-
sulate to my charge whenever he
may absent himself, and should
it be denied <unclear>espectient</unclear>, to 
upon him to explain his reasons for
showing such discourtesy to me and
am not his inferior save in Official
rank.</p>

what was done</p>

<p>United States Consualte
St. Paul de Loanda, 16th June, 1883</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to inform the Depart-
ment of hte loss of the Barque Merlin
of New Bedford, owned by Miss. Tucker &amp; C
&amp; others of that city, on the 22nd May
south of Port Alexander in <unclear>La 1:16 4</unclear>
From a statement of the Captain and crew
original of which I enclose, it appears
that she went aground in a dense fog
and owing to a heavy surf at the time
they could not save her, although they
did all in their power.</p>
<p>The Captain also states that on the voyage 
up, on <unclear>frigid</unclear> his Chronomelero, he found
them out abou 30 miles; and he loses
everything, as he was pact owner and 
was not insured. They left the vessel on
the 23rd taking what they could of
provisions and clothes, and proceeded 
north to Massamedes, where they arrived
on the 24th May, and were taken charge
of</p>

<pb facs="Scan20010.jpg"/>

<p>of, by he Portuguese authorities who
treated them most kindly, and the 
Governor charted a small vessel
to bring them here, where they arrived
on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>The Governor promised to send and
look after the vessel, and pave any-
thing that could possibly be paved,
and pay the expenses incurred, out
of the proceeds, any surplus, to be 
forwarded to the Consulate. Should 
however nothing be paved, the <unclear>Ale</unclear>
will be forwarded for payment by
first steamer.</p>
<p>When men arrived here I have some
difficulty in arranging quarters for
such a large number, however I hired
a house out of town for part, and got
the officers divided into on eor two places
and the whole expense will not exceed
a dollar a head.</p>
<p>By this steamer the Portugal bound
to Lisbon to day I send
1 of the men to St. Thiago where they
belong, 13 to Madeira, as they belong</p>

<pb facs="Scan20011.jpg"/>

<p>to St. Helena, and it is the nearest 
port where there is any communication
with that Island, and
of to Lisbon, who wish to go to America
and where there is more likelihood of
there getting a vessel.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have communication with
St. Helena, but last there is no likelihood 
of any just now, I thought it best to 
send them by this steamer, as stopping
here on chance, would only add to the 
expense. I have arranged with the Agents
of the Mail steamers, Mess. Garredo Camara C. 
to allow one third ff the usual passage
money, which makes the passages as 
follows-</p>
<p>13 men for Madeira @ 4# 520$000
                less 1/3   173$000
                           $347$000= $377.17
          St. Thiago @ 35= 210$000
                less 1/3    70$000
                            140,000= $152.17
              Lisbon @45l # 315$000
                less 1/3    105$000
                            210$000= $228.26
                            Total   $757.620</p>

<pb facs="Scan20012.jpg"/>

<p>For these amounts, I have passed Bills on
the Secretay of State at 15 days sight
in favor of Mes Garrdio Gamara C. each
one separately, so as to make it clear to 
the Captain who is a foreigner I have
also instructed him that he is to have
the Bills endorsed by the Consul where
the men are landed, otherwise they will 
not be paid by the Department.</p>
<p>I have also passed a draft for $338.00 
in favor of Mr. Fred A. Silva of Boston
to pay the board and lodging aperendoceed

<p>Translation</p>

<p>I, the undersigned, Chief of
Board of Health of the province
of Angola, do hereby certify that
L de Rathier du Verge Esq., Consul
of the United States of America at
Loanda, has, since his arrival at
this city, suffered from enduried 
diseases: </p>
<p>The misamedted poison has man-
ifested itself through the intermit-
tent fevers in their various forms,
together with inflamation of the
intert and the library ducts,
congestion of the liver and spleen,
lilious ferus and slight dysenta
ries.</p>
<p>The medicinal treatment not
having obtained a complete cure,
I advised a voyage to the south 
of the province; but the result
was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>For this reason, and seeing that
the patient's health is visibily de-
clining, from day to day, I am 
of opinion that he should, at once, return</p>

<pb facs="Scan20030.jpg"/>

<p>return to America, at the risk of
his life should he remain longer
under the influence of this climate.
The above ismy opinion which I will
conferm under oath, if necessary.</p>
<p>Given at the Board of Health of 
the province of Angola at Loanda
on the 12th day of May 1883.</p>

<p>Sir
After a very <unclear>confule</unclear> study and close obervation
of the United Vice Consul as reported in my dispatch
No 34, I am compelled to state that I came to
the conclusion that a chagne ought to be made
in the United Vice consular appointment of
this city, for the benefit of the United Staes 
Government, its cit and commence-</p>
<p>I believe in fair dealings, but above
all int he appointment of peoples who
are attached tp, and respect the United 
States of America, and who try to do 
their utmost to promote its commerce,
interest, and general success.</p>
<p>Mess. Robert I Neurton and J. Comenge

<p>A few years ago W. libra left for his home, <unclear></unclear>
Mass, but unfortunately died at sea from 
causes unknown.</p>
<p>Since W. Sima death these two young men
clerks took the whole business of Capt. M. Sima
and have paid his brother Frederick A. Silva of
Charlestown Mass. the amount received from
the United States Government for services
as U.S. Vice Commercial Agent and lately
promoted by Mr. Jackson the U.S. Consul
who resigned his post of the "one mouth
Mesedina" as U.S. Vice Consul.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert S. Newton today is R.B.
Majesty paid Vice Consul in tis city, and
being concerned with English gilding on--
<unclear>broidery</unclear> S.S. canes no longer for the ritual
of the Untied States S.S.S.</p>
<p>I willnot enter into particulars
concerning the gentlemen, although
I can change him of disobedience to orders
of others, but I will say that it is my
<unclear>ofsincon</unclear> and that without entertaining
any prejudice or had feeligs toward him 
whatsoever.</p>

<p>Beside the right of his <unclear>remasal</unclear> by my dispatch
No 3 from State Depart. data March 13th
1882 and dsigned J.C. Bancroft Davies
Asst. Secty. of State.</p>
<p>I must repeat that for the benefit of Americans
interests, "of such can he hoped for here," after
on the private letters of mote to my old tiefs,
owners, merchants S with whom I am 
acquainted in Massachusetts, New York,
Maryland, Florida, North and South Carolina
and Maine; and caused <unclear></unclear> the contents
of Capt. Perry's leters, changing his plans
for supplying the Americans Whaling
ships at Loanda S.S. That I call
the attention of the State Department
for an immediate change.</p>
<p>An <unclear></unclear> State Consul came also
be her B. Majesty Consul neither can
M.BB. Majesty's Consul be a true United 
States consul in this part of the Coast.</p>
<p>I would respectfully suggest that 
Mr. Francis Martims Smart a new
ceducated gentleman, and a rising young
merchant of Loanda speaking several 
languages, he very lately ordered from the</p>

<pb facs="Scan20035.jpg"/>

<p>United States, the few congo of Lumber S.S. who 
was brought here by the Am: Back Horace
Scudder under <unclear></unclear> the name of Newton <unclear></unclear>
I believe that this change will benefit
the American common.</p>
<p>I will also report that during my short
absence north, an am: Whaling boat was
lost south of Masssamedes. The Capt. officers
and crew came ot Loanda, and were sent
to Lisbon, by Portuguese mail steamer Portugal
on my return on board the U.S.S. Lumber
leapt A. Ludlow I asked Mr. Newton
about the copy of affidavid concerning
the loss of that vessel and the ammount 
he had paid for th ship wrecked crew
his answer was, that he had sent every
home; and had no copies. I will
mention that in that case, one half of 
the crew were shipped in st. Helana
about 21 months previous of their Cass. and
instead of sending their new boat to 
St. Helena by one of the Welsh he had
chartered to carry cattles for the British
govt. at Ascention he forwarded them 
to Lisbon at a great expense.</p>

<pb facs="Scan20036.jpg"/>

<p>I'm jact Mr. Tenton do not want to have
any superior officer here and Mr. Jackson 
the late U.S. Consul here, went home and
resigned his consulate by Mr. Newton paying
him the full amoutn of his expenses from
home to Loanda and from Loanda to the 
Untied States.</p>

and is still absent; and I have not
any <unclear>inean</unclear> of knowing the exact date
he intended to return, or whether as
so rumoured, he purposed residing
permanently in Lisbon.</p>
<p>I have therefore the honor to return 
<del>the plank</del> the blank force of bond
for such ulterior measures as may be
<unclear>decuted</unclear> fit.</p>
<p>Having thus become acquainted with 
the</p>


<pb facs="Scan30008.jpg"/>

<p>the fact of being suspended without
having rendered any resignation, or
informed in any way by Mn du Verge
of his having nominated Mn. Swart
to fulfil the duties of Vice Consul- an
appointment not intimated to or 
acknowledged by the local Government-
I am reluctantly compelled to conclude 
that the Department must have been 
altogether misinformed on the subject,
and the representations made by 
Mn du Verge a compilation of
<unclear>unistatements</unclear>, which would appear
to be a leading characteristic of that 
officer in nearly all <unclear>reansactious</unclear>
connected with his proceedings when
here. </p>
<p>As however Mn du Verge has
taken with him the official 
correspondence</p>

<pb facs="Scan30009.jpg"/>

<p>correspondence book and the various 
dispatches, prior to the one now adverted
to. I am unable to see on what grounds 
he demanded my substitution, after a 
service which has, for the last fourteen 
years been approved of by the Government.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I 
have to submit whether, conformably
with official procedure, and as a matter
of personal satisfaction, the Department
will not, prior to re-confirming,
Mn. Swarts' nomination, transmit to 
me a copy of Mn du Verge's dispatch on dispatches
on the subjec, in order that I may
offer such explanations as the case
warrants.</p>
<p>Mn du Verge may or may 
not have been <unclear>actinated</unclear> by 
consideration of a higher nature
than</p>

<pb facs="Scan30010.jpg"/>

<p>than personal disappointment at
finding me unwilling to connect
him with my commercial house,
and although he had no grounds
for such expectations, his subsequent
proceedings in the Congo (where he
was employed at a salary, I understand
of 400 a year) as chief of the <unclear></unclear>  <!--there is a pound symbol for money in front of 400.-->
station of the Stanley Expedition, and
his compulsory retirement from that
past at the request of Major General
Sir Frederick Goldsmid, who came
out to the Congo last year, on a special
mission from the King of the Belgians,
have not tended to produce that 
confidence which should have
distinguished an officer of the Consular
Service, and who had not gained the

<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
JUL 1 1884
RECEIVER</p>

<p>United States Consulate
St Paul de Loanda
14 June 1883</p>

<p>To the Assistant Secretary of State
Washington</p>

<p>Sir
I have the honor to lay below the Department
of State the following circumstances connected with
the discharge of my duties as Vice-Consul for the 
United States at this port. M L de R du Verge
left Loanda for the Congo on the 16th ultimo by the
Portuguese Mail Steamer for the purpose it is reported
of arranging with 11th Stanley the details of the post he
has accepted under the Belgian Expedition without 
handing over to me the Archives of the Consulate or
acquainting me as to whether I should be able
to have access to any documents or forms which
might he required, although I saw that officer on
the day of his departure.</p>
<p>Had there been no immediate Consular duties
to perform I should have waited the return of 10
du Verge for an explanation of this, and also for an
explanation on a matter of a personal nature which
has recently come to light.</p>
<p>The facts of the case are these: On the arrival
on the thid inst of the wrecked crew of the American
Whalt "Merlin" marti, a Swiss, holding a Dry
Goods Retail Shop where Mr Du Verge had hired a 
room, as his residence and offices, Mr Marti who
possesses the key gave me permission to enter but
would not permit me to take the ships Register as
the Archives he said were left in his charge and I am 
unable</p>

<pb facs="Scan30019.jpg"/> 

<p>unable to register my official correspondence in the
proper official Book which appeared to be locked away.</p>
<p>Wishing to take to my office the Ships
Register did not appear to me any infraction of
the rules or had Mr Marti any official right or 
Authority to interfere with me, for in the first place
the room offered no facilities for writing, and in
the Second I could not without great inconvenience
to myself obtain the assistance of my mercantile clerk
to write up the register.</p>
<p>That Mr Marti who does not possess the
highest reputation for soberness or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the archives and superintend
my actions over theme, shows a want of official
consideration by Mr du Verge and is more over contrary 
to the instructions.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances and not
possessing the key of the room no responsibility can
be attached to me for the safety of the Consular
papers but I shall endeavour to exercise such
supervision over them as is consistent with my 
relations with Mr Marti.</p>
<p>It may be inferred that there exists a
difference between Mr du Verge and myself but such
is not the case if his friendly pretensions are to be 
considered as a proof of his sincerity and I am
quite at a loss to understand what movtive he has 
to pass me over in matters appertaining to the
consulate with which I have been connected for
a long period having been appointed to my present
position since 1868. And for many years have been 
in sole charge of the office without, I venture to 
state, giving the Department any cause of complaint</p>

<pb facs="Scan30020.jpg"/> 

<p>or in any way failed to discharge the duties faithfully
and conscientiously</p>
<p>I may also state that my long residence
here as Merchant and holding the post of British-Vice-
Consul which I presume is not incompatible with
my position as United States Vice-Consul, give me
a status that facilitates considerably the settlement
of Consular business with the local authorities, with
whom I have always been on the most friendly and
intimate relationship.</p>
<p>The information that has been given regarding
myself personally is that Mr Marti has failed to obtain
any one here to sign a bond for him to be Vice Consul at
Loanda, from which I infer that Mr du Verge has
applied to the Department to have me substituted but 
on what ground I am unable to say.</p>
<p>In submitting the foregoing matters for the
information of the Department I have the honor to 
request that should there be no reason why I should
 not continue to hold the post of Vice-Consul, that 
Mr du Verge should be instructed to cosign the
archives of the Consulate to my charge whenever he
may absent himself and, should it be deemed
expedient, to call upon him to explain his reasons
for showing such discourtesies to me, as I am
not his inferior save in official rank. </p>

Sir
Your most Obedient Servant

<p>United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda
3 May 1884</p>

<p>Sir
I am advised of the non-payment of the
two Bills No 4 $350 and No8 $144 drawn
in my favor by Consul du Verge on the Secretary
of the Treasury on the ground that he was in a 
condition not responsible for his actions at the
tint of signing.</p>
<p>I beg to enclose copy of a dispatch I
find has been inserted in the Official Correspondence
Book by Mr du Verge advising the drawing
of one of these bills.</p>
<p>These Bills were sent to me by M du Verge
from Banana in a letter of which I have the 
honor to transmit a copy.</p>
<p>While Mr du Verge was in the Congo he
ordered in his capacity as cheif of the Station at
Vici, of the Belgians Association, Several articles which
were charged to him and as it will be seen by the
enclosed copy of account, there remained a balance
after payment of his Bills, which I did not for a  
moment doubt, due to him of 30:3:4 for which <!--there is a pound symbol for money in front of 30.-->
I remitted to him, by the racket of the 15th of last
month. </p>

<pb facs="Scan30022.jpg"/> 

<p>month a Bill on my Agents. The payment of that
Bill I have ordered to be stopped in the usual way
until further reasons are given for the non-
payment of the said two Bills by the Secretary 
of the Treasury.</p>
<p>There will I venture to believe be very
little doubt in your mind that the allegation
set forth by Mr du Verge is a vile invention to
serve his own ends and an act inconsistent with
integrity and honesty. If therefore Mr du Verge
cannot be called upon by the Government to make
good the Amount he is now indebted to me I 
shall be under the painful necessity of prosecuting 
him by law</p>
<p>I may state that there are several persons
residents in this city who saw Mr du Verge at
Banana in the Congo previous to his departure
for Europe as well as the Captain of the Steamer
in which he took passage could state that he 
did not appear to be in any way irresponsible
for his acts.</p>

<p>Loanda. Aug. 15. 1884</p>

<p>Robt Newton Esq
Vice Consul of U.S.A.
at Loanda
Africa.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,
The following is a concise statemet of the facts with reference
to our expulsion from Bailundo and Bihé.</p>
<p>The "American Mission" as we are commonly designated was
etablished in April 1884 in Bailundo and extended to Bihe 
in March of the present year. In both of these countries
we held the most friendly relations with the natives, both the
Sobas adn the people at large. I Bihe these amicable
relaitons continued to the day of our departure and we still
have the invitation of the Loba of that country to come there 
in a body.</p>
<p>In Bailurdo our peace was disturbed on the 15th of May by
a letter bearing the signature of the Soba &amp; his consellors
command to depart from Bailundo and all its
dependencies</p>

<pb facs="Scan40005.jpg"/> 

<p>dependencies and never to <unclear>petur</unclear> and forbidding any of the
mission to vesel the King in person as was our custom when
carrying on any important negotiation with him.</p>
<p>So sudden a change in the <unclear>treakwent</unclear> of how Sobaenho
had always protected us in every way possible to him
required explanation. Negotiations continued for
six weeks brought to light the following facts</p>
<p>Mr Braga a Trader at Calumbella had gone to Bihé
and there <unclear>treed</unclear> to induce the Soba to expel that part of the
mission which was located there, but failed to
accomplish his purpose the Soba not only refusing
to send away those who were there, but inveiting the whole
mission to locale in his country, a thing which was
under the circumstances impossible.</p>
<p>Proceeding to Bailundo Mr Braga brought the
full power of his influence to bear upon the Soba there.
He informed him that we intended to kill the Soba
blow up his village, destroy his family, and take
possession of the country. Then that information 
failed</p>

<pb facs="Scan40006.jpg"/> 

<p>failed to move the Soba he told him, we had committed
<unclear>ceinces</unclear> in our country, and he had been sent by the
Governor of Benguella, to drive us out and if the Soba
should refuse to send us away he would get
himself and his country into trouble.</p>
<p>(I) the sauce <unclear></unclear> Mr B kindly conseuled to come 
and occupy our village and give the Soba and his men
al the Whiskey they would if he would drive us out and
he even went so far in his benevolent offers us to say he
would be willing to bury our houses and kill us all if the 
Kin would give him permission to do so. But the King
refused. Several of the Mission heard Mr B's Seerelary
say that this master advised the King to Kill us but the 
King refused.</p>
<p>Though unwilling to have us killed the Soba was
quite unable to withstand the pressure which was brought
upon him to drive us out and we were compelled to 
leave July 4th. Mr B. immediately taking possession
of our houses.</p>

<pb facs="Scan40007.jpg"/> 

<p>He reached Benguella July 20th after a severe and to
the ladies and children, perilous journey with our
lives, a little clothing and nothing more. Al of our 
large and costly outfit having been of necessity left
behind.</p>
<p>The Governor of Benguella to whom we applied
for redress, has in accordance with his own requet been
forwarded with an <unclear>eslinate</unclear> of our loss.</p>

from Mossamedes to this port in 1883 for
payment of the freight viz: 300000 equal
to $325 00/100 and I beg to request that the
Government will authorize me to pay him
at once as Mr Bastos has been always
exceedingly kind and of great service to all
American Sailors that have come to his port. 
Unless</p>

<p>Unless this is attended to at once I am
afraid that any future American sailors that
may arrive at Mossamedes in distress, will
have great difficulty in obtaining assistance.</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE

RECEIVED.</p>

<p>United States Consulate
St. Paul de Loanda
November 11 1884</p>

<p>Sir
During the last month 
I have been on a visit along
the coast in one of the mail
steamers as far as Mayumba
and also visited Banana
Landana and Loango and
returned here in <unclear>H.M.L. Flirt</unclear>
on the 23rd October, the Captain
having been kind enough 
to giv me a passage to Loanda.</p>
<p>As the particulars of my
trip may be of interest to 
the Department I beg to submit
some at Banana. I met</p>

<pb facs="Scan40017.jpg"/> 

<p>Sir Francis de Winton, Chief
Administrator of the International
Association and from a 
conversation I had with him
he seems anxious to eradicate
certain bad opinions that are
prevalent among the traders
affirming that he is willing
to assist them in every way and
glad to see them going ahead
and following in the footsteps
of the Association, and that 
he has no idea whatever of
putting any difficulty in the
way of any person wishing to
open trade. He is trying to 
get things into good working
order as up to the present
there has been no system whatever 
and</p>

<pb facs="Scan40018.jpg"/> 

<p>and a great waste of money.</p>
<p>He talks of a small railway 
from York to Stanley Pool a
distance of about 230 miles to
open up the country calculating
that the coast would be $2000.000.
but to show any result he would
require a traffic of at least
100 tons a day at <unclear>freight</unclear> of
about <unclear></unclear>. I think this
would be a very bad invest-
ment as there are many qualities
of African produce that could
afford to pay such a price unless
 it was obtained in the interior 
for mere normal value and 
I must say that I do not see 
where the 100 tons a day are to 
come from.</p>

<pb facs="Scan40019.jpg"/> 

<p>I also <unclear></unclear> here Captain Grant
Elliott, Administrator for
the Association at Loango, and
his idea is a railway from
the <unclear>Accuills</unclear> and up the Niarri
valley which would be almost
a direct line to Stanley Pool
and much less expensive as
they would not have such a
mountainous district to go 
through.</p>
<p>Harely in the Congo between
Nokki and Boma the Dutch
House had two factories one at
Caicaurio and the other at
Mussuca vurnt down by the 
malives, suffering great loss, there
being at the time over 6000 of
ivory and 7 tons of rubber besides 
a</p>

<pb facs="Scan40020.jpg"/> 

<p>a great quantity of goods
for trade; the loss is estimated
at $15,000</p> 
<p>The Dutch have attacked 
the malives and burnt  number
of villages and taken the King
and Queen of Caicamaxio prisoners.</p>
<p>I found the German Man
of War "Moewe" had been at Banana
taking Coal and sailed for Angera
Sequena on the 16th September.
She had Dr. Nachligal on board 
and I heard that a large German
Expedition is reported as about
to start form Africa Sequena
for the upper Congo, so no doubt
Dr. Nachligal has gone there to
weet them.</p>
<p>At Landana I found the
French</p>

<pb facs="Scan40021.jpg"/> 

<p>French Man of War "Lepond: and
the Portuguese Sunboat Lado
with the Secretary of the Government
 of Angola on board, swing to a 
question between the French
missionaries established there
and the natives aout some ground
that they (the missionaries) had
taken charge of, and they had
requested a man of War to come
to their assistance as they would not recognize the authority of the
Portuguese Delegate who was in 
charge, as Landana was supposed
to be within the Portuguese Protectorate.</p>
<p>The first question the French 
took up was that Landana was
within the disputed territory of
5o 12' &amp; So South, and after the 
Observations</p>
