<p>United States Consulate General<lb/>
Monrovia, March 28, 1882</p>

<p>M. A Aenmey to the Second Assist. Secretary of State</p>
<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you that, during the last three weeks, several British war vessels have touched at Monrovia. Their visit were caused by the expected arrival here of Captain A. E. Havelock, Governor in Chief of Her <sic>Brittanic</sic> Majesty's West African Settlements, who has been recently appointed to discharge the duties of British Consul near the Government of Liberia, to receive his exequatur and to conduct certain negotiations between the two governments.</p>

<p>The British vessels called either for orders or to received dispatches.</p>

<p>Governor Havelock announced that he would arrive here on the 11th inst. On receipt of this notification the Liberian Consul at Sierra Leone was directed to request the Governor to defer his visit until the 28th instant. H.M.S. Briton which arrived here on the 11th inst. brought a dispatch from Governor Havelock in which he regretted that <catchwords>he</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-3014.jpg"/>

he could not defer his visit later than the 17th inst. In that despatch occasion was taken to indicate the subjects upon which negotiations were desired on the part of the <sic>Brittish</sic> Government. These subjects were, I understand, the following–viz</p>

<p>1. The Manna River Claims. (2) The Claims of Mr Harris, a British subject, residing at Sulymah, a place claimed to be within the jurisdiction of Liberia and (3) the Northwest Boundary Question.– The Manna River claims are certain sums claimed by a few British traders, who were doing in the Manna Country in 1871, at the time the Liberian Government sent an expedition into the territory, to punish a refracting chief, known as Prince Manna, who at that time raided in the neighborhood of the settlement of Robertsport, burning native Hamlets, killing the inmates and carrying both Americo Liberians and native citizens of the Republic into captivity; Mr Roye's Government informed Sir A. E. Kennedy, then Governor of Sierra Leone, that a military expedition would be sent against Prince Manna; Sir A. E. Kennedy issued a notification to the <sic>Brittish</sic> traders in the territory acquainting them of the proposed movement and requiring them to remove their persons and <catchwords>property</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-3015.jpg"/>

property within British territory. Although more than twenty day's elapsed, before the Liberian force reached the neighborhood of their factories, they seem to have neglected to remove. A Resident of the town, in which the factories were, stated at the time of the Expedition that there was an understanding in the town that one the <sic>approch</sic> of the Liberian forces the injury should be all attributed to them. The <sic>factorys</sic> </p>
