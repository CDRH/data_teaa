<p>Sir,<lb/>
I have the honor to acknowledge 
dispatch no 43, dated May 6th,
1886 from the Department of State
involving a draft of a new treaty 
and a "Full Power" from the President
for you to conclude the
same.</p>
<p>I at once placed myself in
communication with His Highness
the Sultan of Zanzibar and
sent him a draft of the proposed
treaty.</p>
<p>His Highness expressed himself
as very much gratified that the
United States Goverment was
willing to make a new treaty
to his advantage.  The treaty was
immediately drawn up in the
<catchwords>English</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_131322"/>

English and Arabic languages, and
on the third July <sic>is was</sic> signed
by myself and H. H. Plenipotentiary.</p>
<p>The treaty was made in duplicate; 
our copy is inclosed
with this dispatch the other
is in His Highness possession.</p>
<p>I have read over carefully the
English &#38; German treaties and I
cannot see that there are any advantages.
that they get that is not afforded
us.</p>
<p>His Highness the Sultan did
not raise our question but ordered
the treaty got ready.</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted to our
<unclear>Kanji Ragjah</unclear>, a native gentleman
how who is an intimate friend
of His Sultan, in getting the treaty
through so quickly.</p>

<p>
Sir:<lb/>
I have the honor to request the
Department of State to inform me
if any allowance will be made me
for making the new treaty with the
Sultan of Zanzibar.</p>
<p>I consider that such work is
outside of the line of a Consul's duty
and it made a great deal of extra
work and trouble, as is always the
case in these Oriental countries.</p>
<p>The Treaty was to be got through
in a great hurry and it was only
from my being as any old friend of
the Sultan's that it was finished
in as short a time.</p>
<p>The salary of this Consulate is only $1000 per annum and I
consider that $500 would be a fair
recompense for my outside work on this 
new treaty</p>

<ab>To the Hon.<lb/>

Washington, D.C.</ab>

<p>Sir:<lb/>
I have the honor to enclose 
herewith a letter from the
Sultan of Zanzibar to the
Department of State a copy of
which he has sent to the Consulate
and which I have translated
and also enclosed herewith. </p>

<p>The sum and substance of
the communication is, a request 
of our Government to sanction
a tax on his own subjects, which
I have assured His Highness will
be undoubtedly granted him.</p>

<p>The Germans &#38; English as
a pretense for making trouble with
the Sultan, claim that he has no
right to levy any taxes or duties
on any produce raised in the 
<catchwords>Sultanate</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_131837"/>

Sultanate of Zanzibar other
than is specified in new
treaties, even on his own subjects.
The Sultan claims that he has a right to tax his own subjects
as he pleases and produce belonging
to them--</p>

<p>This is a matter which does not in the least concern
Americans or American interests in any way and which I
assume that our Government
will not care for me to take any
part in the troubles likely to arrive
from this dispute.</p>

<p>We had the honor to inform you in a telegram of the 6th August that we directed
a letter to your Excellency, this is the letter.</p>

<p>We have the pleasure to inform your Excellency, that the new treaties with England

concluded with your country entered in force
on the 19th of August 1886 corresponding to the
<choice><orig>Kisawahili</orig><reg>Kiswahili</reg></choice> New Year and that the Custom 
House is in our own hands.</p>
<p>I have to inform you that in the new
treaties are not mentioned fifty five articles
of produce of our <unclear>coast</unclear> and on which we always 
had 5% duty. This produce has nothing
to do with the imports and exports by Europeans.

<p>It concerns only my own people who 
do not pay any other taxes, so we continue
to tax the fifty-five articles of produce as before
at 5%.</p>

<p>We send you the names of the fifty-five 
articles of named produce in a list
joined to the letter and ask you to consider
it and sanction it.  Salaam!</p>

To the Hon.<lb/>
Third Assist Secr. of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</ab>

<p>Sir:<lb/>
I have the honor to inform
you that the 14th inst.
a fleet of six German Man-of-war
under Admiral Knorr
arrived at this fort followed
on the 15th by two French
and one English is now
lying in the harbor.</p>

<p>The object of this movement has not yet been made public
but it is understood that
the Sultan has been compelled 
to cede a large portion of his
Coast territory to Germany and
one seaport to England.</p>

<p>This, of course, is the end
of Arab power on this Coast forever.</p>

<pb facs="20170620_132125"/>

<p>In my opinion American
interests and all foreign interests
but Germany, will suffer
greatly by these changes and
it is greatly to be regretted
that some government would
not assist the Sultan's government against this German
robbery.</p>

<p>Considering that the Sultan's 
power to control the various
wild &#38; lawless tribes which are
under his scrutiny, will be
materially weakened and that
our large American interests
are absolutely without protection 
in case of riot or bombardment, 
and that as the
first treaty power with the
Sultan we should be in some
way <unclear>represented</unclear> in the important
changes and transfers soon
to take place. I recommend
that an American man-of-war
of good sire be sent to remain

<pb facs="20170620_132131"/>

here at Zanzibar until this trouble is definitely settled.</p>

<p>I trust that the government
will take immediate
action in this matter as it
is one which admits of no 
delay.</p>

<p>As representative of the
two largest houses in Zanzibar
I feel very anxious about the
large amount of property belonging
to me lying exposed
to fire or any incindiary acts.
Also the future of the American
trade seems very uncertain and
I fear will be very much injured
by the precedence which this affair will give Germany--</p>

<p>Sir,<lb/>
I had the honor to address
you on the 15th August 86 from
Zanzibar asking an allowance
of  $500 for making a treaty with
his Sultan.  On the 28th Feb. 86 you
replied that there was no authority
of law to make an allowance.</p>

<p>I had hoped as the claim was just 
something would <add place="above">be</add>allowed me. I went
to considerable expense to get the treaty
through quickly which I could not
afford out of $1000 per annum salary.</p>

<p>The climate of Zanzibar is a very
trying one for whitemen and my
health has been impaired by a residence
there.  I take the liberty to ask of the
Hon. Secretary that some consideration
of my care will be taken.</p>

<ab>To the Hon.<lb/>
Third Assit. Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</ab>

<p>Sir:<lb/>
I have the honor to inform
you that the German
operations on this Coast have
so far resulted in the acquistion 
of a strip of mangrove
swamp and marsh land some
forty miles long, situated on the
Coast about two hundred miles
North of Zanzibar, also a German
protectorate is acknowledged
for Witu, and the lease of two
Custom Houses on the Coast
to the German East African Trading
Company- the Sultan's authority is restricted to a strip
of coast land ten miles wide extending from <unclear>Tunge Bay</unclear> to 
<unclear>Kapermie</unclear> and ten miles around
<catchwords>Each of</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_132501"/>

Each of his Bin Addah towns 
but the terms of this agreement
are I suppose more familiar 
to the Department than to me.</p>

<p>At the time of writing my
Despatch No. 106 in which I
suggest that a man-of-war
be sent here on account of this
German incident  - feeling against
white-men in town was very
bitter and there was every prospect
of trouble, but at present the
negotiations are progressing favorably
&#38; quietly and there
is now no necessity for a man-of-war
to call here, although it always <add place="above">has</add>a good effect, and 
I should very much like to 
see one of our gun-boats in
the harbor for a month or two
just at present. </p>

<p>The workings of the new 
tarriff on articles imported in 
to the island of Zanzibar
from the mainland are not
<catchwords>wholly</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_132507"/>

wholly satisfactory - this is
especially applicable to Ivory, 
the market price of which it
is very difficult to fit and the
Sultan's Collector of Customs
at present is a most unsuitable
man for the place and who
uses his position unfairly to
further his own business; he
also, by buying small lots at
high prices keeps the price of
Ivory far above what it should
be -- as my commercial position
in Zanzibar is principally to
buy Ivory this affects me directly.</p>

<p>As soon as the German
affair is settled, the Sultan
will be forced to summon this
Collector and observe the spirit as well as the letter of the treaties.
I am personally in sympathy
with the Germans &#38; English
in this moment although
I am aware that our goverment
does not wish to interfere
<catchwords>in any way</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_132514"/>

in any way with the internal
affairs of the Sultan's government
but I think that a joint protest 
of the German, English and
American Consuls against this
man's continuing in office will
benefit all nationalities without
unpleasant complications.</p> 

<p>I have to report the death
of the Interpreter of this Consulate
<unclear>Joharri bin Saif</unclear> on the 29th inst.
after a service of nearly forty years:
his place will probably be filled
by an appointee of Consul Pratts
after he takes over the office.</p>

the Department of some recent

<p>Dr. Arendt late Imperial <unclear>Seaman</unclear>

It is presumed that Dr. Arendt has been recalled by his government.</p>

<p>In this connection the
resignation of Sir John Kirk
No. B. M. Political Agent and
Consul General is significant 
since it would appear to be
in the direct line of British
non-interference with the project
of the German Government
for the colonization of the
East Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>This market has for some time

<p><hi rend="underline">American Imports</hi></p>
<p>The imports from the United

nominally of refined Petroleum,
unbleached cotton, and soap--
These being the staples handled
by the American houses engaged
in this trade.  The former
of these by its phenomenal cheapness
 has completely taken the
place of the vegetable oils, which
in former times were used
exclusively for illuminating
purposes.</p>

command it-to- the serious
consideration of exporters in the
America.  The yearly consumption
of East Africa -- Zanzibar
being the distributing point --
is upwards of 75,000 cases.</p>

<p>American cottons have for
many years been the standards

<ab><unclear>Honorable</unclear> James D. Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>

<p>Sir:<lb/>
I have to request of
The Department instructions
in relation to the Article in
the English and German
treaties stipulating that 
gards may be <unclear>landed</unclear> here
in bond for a period not 
exceeding six months.</p>

<p>This question is liable
to arise at any time
and I should be glad to know just what rights
<catchwords>might</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_133404"/>

might be claimed by Americans under this article.</p>

<p>The clause in the
new treaties relating to the 
duty of twenty-five per cent
in spiritous liquors is politically
a dead-letter from
the fact that France has
not assented to the application
of the Revised Tariff
of Zanzibar to the Exports
of France cultivating this
<unclear>country</unclear>.</p> 

<p>Naturally, the English and German merchants objected
to paying any higher
duty on spiritous liquers
than was being paid by
the French i.e. five per cent
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_133409"/>

and the new rate (25%) 
consequently could not be 
sustained.</p>


<p>The Sultan doubtless
having in mind the fact
that this new rate was intended
in part as a compensation for a reduction
of the duty in certain articles of the Export is not
inclined to allow the foreign
merchants any privileges under the new
treaties.</p>

<p>It is well known that
the Sultan does not look
with favor on the idea of
<unclear>landing</unclear> gards in <unclear>Bond</unclear>
and he might possibly
<catchwords>object</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_133414"/>

object on the grounds mentioned 
above.</p>

<p>It is often a great
convenience -- as well as a
saving of Expense -- to Americans
engaged in business
here. No land gards in
<unclear>bond</unclear> since in <unclear>that</unclear> way
a vessel might proceed
direct  to her destination
without stopping at an
intermediate port.</p>

<p>Honorable James D. Porter,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:<lb/>
I have the honor to advise
the Department at this 
time in relation to the Claim
of Dr. B. F. Wilson against
Sultan Abdallah, King of 
Johanna.</p> <!-- Based on timing, is this Saidi Abdallah bin Salim? -->

<p>This claim is of long
standing and the Department
has long since been 
made acquainted with particulars
 of the same.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson now appeals
again to the Government of
the United States through
the Department of State
for some relief from the
burden under which he 
is laboring. </p>

<pb facs="20170620_133543"/>

<fw>(2)</fw>
<p>To my own knowledge, he 
(Dr. Wilson) is virtually insolvent
and is consequently
so pressed by his <unclear>creditors</unclear>
in all sides as to be seriously
hampered in the prosecution
of his business.</p>

<p>By his <unclear>nurturing</unclear> and
intelligent efforts he has
developed his sugar plantation
to such a state <choice><sic>of of</sic><corr>of</corr></choice> perfection as to make it
(if unencumbered) a most-desirable
property.</p>

<p>But with its present debt
it is quite impossible for
him to work it to a profit.</p>

<p>There is no doubt
that had the King of Johanna
not taken the Contemptable
action he did to injure
his prospects he (Dr. Wilson)
would have been now in
a position to realize large
benefits from his <unclear>imparted</unclear>
Estate.</p>

<pb facs="20170620_133609"/>

<fw>(3)</fw>
<p> 3 September, 1885. When 
Commander <unclear> P. F. Mannington</unclear>
visited Johanna in the
<unclear>"Jornata"</unclear> he made inquiry
into the matter as far as
was possible and it was
very difficult to get away
one to go in board the
<unclear>"Jornata"</unclear> to testify against
the King. Knowing that at the moment the vessel left
they would be punished
for so doing.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson has when
opportunity offered obtained
what evidence he could 
bearing in his case: and
I am sending the same
herewith, as per the subjoined list of enclosures.</p>

<p>When Captain Potter
was at Johanna in the
"Lancaster" in April of last
year he was inclined to
take some action in the
<catchwords>matter</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_133616"/>

<fw>(4)</fw>

matter. But the arrival 
of the French gunboat
<unclear>"Chaeal"</unclear> in the harbor bearing 
the Commandant of the
<unclear>Mayatta</unclear> with instructions
from his government to take
over the Protectorate of the
Island but a new phase
in the affair and the
"Lancaster" <unclear>returned</unclear> in good
<unclear>order</unclear>.</p>

<p>It would appear that
the King was coerced into
signing the treaty with the 
French in account of the
presence of an American
man o'war in port from
the fact that he afterwards
<unclear></unclear> against receiving
the French resident who
was finally landed by
force in April of this year.</p>

<p>I am informed that
the President has recently
been negotiating a new
<catchwords>treaty</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_133632"/>

<fw>(5)</fw>
treaty with the King but I
have no idea what terms
have been made.</p>

<p>From all that I
have been able to learn,
Dr. Wilson's actual losses
by the King's interference
cannot be less than 300,000.</p>

<p>Besides which he has
been a sufferer from
defamation of character
and from attempts on
his life.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would
not be out of place for
me to say here that I
have yet to hear one word 
of derogoration of his character
<unclear>in business methods</unclear>.
-- This among my acquaintances in
<unclear>Mauritius</unclear> <unclear></unclear>
Madagascar and Elsewhere</p>

<p>If this were not the case.
I imagine that he would
long since have been
<catchwords>compelled</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_133648"/>
<fw>(6)</fw>

compelled to have retired
from the field.</p>

Department would give this
matter the attention to which
I believe it is entitled.</p>

<ab>B. F. Wilson <unclear></unclear>, M.D.

<p>Dear Sir,<lb/>
Regarding your Claim against the King of Johanna
for indemnity for the loss you have suffered through his
interference with your labor supply during the past four
years, we can say that we are well aware of the serious
injury done to you and <unclear>ourselves</unclear> by the large reduction in
the quanitity of sugarproduced by <unclear>Patsy Estate</unclear> resulting
from that interference.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that had the Sultan not 
compelled a large number of your laborers to leave your
employment with the object of crippling your operations,
you would at this time have been able to repay us the
important advances of funds we made to you through <unclear>Messrs</unclear>
<unclear></unclear> for the purpose of working your Estate.</p>

<p>Your claim for indemnity is therefore clearly just 
and indisputable, and we trust the United States Government
will enforce its payment as soon as possible.</p>

<p>With reference to the representation which we
learn, have been made to your government by some evil
<unclear>dispised persons</unclear>, reflecting on your moral character, we can 
only say they are false and malicious.  During the last
ten years we have been intimately acquainted with you: we 
have therefore had every opportunity of observing your
behavior both here and in Johanna, and we <unclear>are found</unclear>

<ab><unclear>Domony</unclear>, Johanna<lb/>
May, 1887</ab>

<p>Dear Doctor Wilson,<lb/>
Having been requested to act as an expert in
estimating the damage you suffered through the acts of Sultan
Abdallah, and being personally aquainted with the affairs and
also with the unwarranted conduct of Sultan Abdallah, toward you,
I hereby state my opinion in the matter.</p>

<p>I know very well that the Sultan threatened
your life by giving orders to his armed men to shoot you when 
they would get a chance of doing so; as you did not give
them the opportunity the plot failed, but it is nevertheless clear
that the detention in your house through threats of being shot at,
prevented you from attending to the work of your plantation, as well
as to any other business you may have had in hand. I have seen
also in your house several places where the boards had been cut
through by bullets fired in the night and evidently intended for
you.  I know also of the scuttling and sinking of your
steam launch while at her ancorage, and of the stealing of anchors
and chains in your boat shed, all acts perpetuated by the Sultan's
men and by his orders.</p>

<p>Regarding your labour, it is very well known to me and
to every one in the island that in year <hi rend="underline">1883</hi> the Sultan took 
away some hundred free men who were working for you, and
gave orders to the Johannamen to withdraw from your employment
any and all the slaves they had in it.  This taking place while
you were in full crop interfered, not only with that crop, but with
those that followed, as it prevented you from doing your planting
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_134026"/>

many other important works.</p>

<p>From the quantities of sugar you made during the
preceding years, that is from 1879-1882 included, it is evident
that during that period your crops were increasing by about
one hundred tons every year.  In the year <hi rend="underline">1883</hi>, time of the 
Sultan's interference, you made only <hi rend="underline">half</hi> the quantities of sugar
of the preceding year or <hi rend="underline">three hundred tons less</hi> than you should
have made had you not been interfered with by the Sultan.</p>

<p>The following years, 1884-1888, show a slight increase 
but not in a ratio with the first alluded to (1879-1882), and I should
say that in those last years (1884-1886), your yearly loss was 
as heavy as 1883, or about <hi rend="underline">three hundred tons yearly</hi> making
a total loss for the four years <unclear>1883</unclear>-1886, of <hi rend="underline">twelve hundred tons</hi>, 
which, at the Mauritius market prices during these years would
be worth, with interest, <hi rend="underline">Rs. 300.000.</hi></p>

<p>The above I consider to be as near as possible your losses
from the Sultan's interference with your labor in 1883 and 1886 not
speaking of the aforementioned attempts at your life, &#38;c, and
the general inconvenience you were put to by such unwarrantable
acts.</p>

<p>Trusting that the U.S. Government will give to your
case all the attention it deserves, and that you may some day
be compensated for your losses,</p>

<p>Dear Sir,<lb/>
In reply to your 
communication asking for any information
known to me concerning your late troubles
with the Sultan Abdallah and for which you are
claiming an indemnity, I can state that
your labor supply was almost entirely taken
away from you leaving scarely sufficient
people to gather in your crop, thus neglecting
all necessary work for future years such as
planting, hoeing, &#38;c. Knowing as I do the
progress made in yields during the first ten years
cultivation of virgin land. I can assert that
your loss must <add place="above">have been</add>enormous.</p>

<p>From the bullet holes I have seen in your house
which were made by the Sultan's soldiers when
passing through your estate I consider your
life to have been in great danger. Indeed
I know that it was so threaten that you
had to exercise great caution even in moving
round your house and entirely prevented
from attending to your outside work. No one
can entertain any doubt about your
losses under such circumstances and
I hope that your Government will give

<p>To B. F. Wilson,<lb/>
Proprietor of Patsy Estate<lb/>

<p>Dear Sir,<lb/>
Having been compelled by force when
imprisoned at <unclear>Baumban</unclear> by Sultan Abdallah to 
make a false statement concerning you. I now 
wish to declare and publish that that statement 
was false. It was written by Sultan Abdallah for
his own purpose and I was forced to sign it under
penalty of death if I did not. The statement
that he made me sign was that you had given
me money to have his men to go and fight for
Prince Mohammed <del></del> and that you would pay
ten dollars per head for slaves and fifty dollars for 
free men and in case a slave died or was
killed you would pay fifty dollars to his master.</p>

<p>All this I now solemnly swear is false.
I wish here to state also I have often heard
Sultan Abdallah say that he intended to drive you
away from Johanna and take your planatation for
his own benefit and that of his own son <unclear>Salim</unclear>. I have
heard him avow this intention many times
previous to the outbreak of trouble between him
and his brother, Prince Mohammed since
that occurred I was arrest and imprisoned

<p>Dear Sir,<lb/>
As you requested when I went to Johanna on behalf of
the Oriental Bank Corporation and the firm of <unclear> Moudlette</unclear> to inspect
and report upon the Sultan's sugar estate at <unclear>Baumban</unclear> I thoroughly
inspected the estate "Patsy" belonging to Doctor Wilson. I found
Patsy estate very well managed indeed the canes well cultivated,
and the plant of machinery in good order.  I should judge that
Dr. Wilson will this coming season turn out about 400 tons of sugar
and I see no reason why he should not go on increasing his 
production yearly, say from 70 to 100 tons until he makes 800 to 900
tons per annum. Dr. Wilson has done a great deal of hand and
intellectual work at Patsy, and it is my opinion that had his labour
<add place="side">supply</add> not been interfered with by the Sultan since 1882 (When he made
<unclear>527</unclear> tons of sugar). that he would have been making the 800 to 900 tons
annunally since <unclear>1884</unclear></p>

<p>Doctor Wilson's losses from the cause above alluded to I
am sure cannot be less than one hundred <add place="above">thousand</add> pounds sterling, taking
into consideration the heavy fall in prices of sugar price that time,
interest, etc etc, besides the loss of a certain quantity of cane abandoned 
and left in the ground, the latter taking from the soil the necessary
properties for future cultivation of them.</p>

<p>The French Protectorate will I hope and trust work well
for future operations as there is an abundance of labour on the island,
and the men want to work, but as it appears were only deterred
from doing so by the Sultan who evidently does not wish to see
<catchwords>foreigners</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170620_134437"/>

foreigners succeed in his island. With the Protectorate he will not
be allowed to interfere.</p>

<p>I do not consider that there is any risk whatsoever in
making advances to Wilson for working his estate.</p>

<p>Dr. B. F. Wilson has made <unclear>516</unclear> tons of sugar in 1882. At the
commencement of the 1882 crop he was deprived of labor by
Sultan Abdallah, as that he could not extend his plantation,
and it has been invariably the same every year since that time
(1882) so that instead of increasing his production of sugar
yearly as he might have done had he had the required labour,
it has fallen off, so that his last crop was only 227 tons;
whereas he might have made, if not interefered with, 900 tons of 
sugar the last season: the estate being able to produce about
1500 tons of sugar, if all is put under cultivation.</p>

<p>It is a very easy matter for a crop to be largely reduced by
want of labour during one season: but it is very difficult, and
requires much time to increase it again. It will take Dr. Wilson
at least four years to get his production of sugar what it
would have been had he not been interefered with.</p>

<p>I have had much experience on sugar plantations, being an
agricultural chemist, and I consider myself well able to judge 
in this case, having spent <del>the</del> last twelve years in sugar
colonies.</p>

<p>Another important consideration in connection with Dr. Wilson's
losses is the fall in the price of sugars for the last two years,
which has been more than 30%; so even if Dr. Wilson can
produce the same quanitity of sugar as he had been able to 
produce before, he could not get the same profit.</p>

<ab>Johanna, 25th April 1886</ab>
<p>Ten days ago, the U. S. S. Lancaster was here, Captain 
<unclear>Potter</unclear> recieved from Sultan Abdallah a letter containing
I have been told to false statements against Dr. Wilson,
and placing him <unclear></unclear> false position: this letter,
bearing the signature of Prince Mohom<add place="above">m</add>ed. When Dr. Wilson
knew this he made some enquiries and learned positively
that Prince Mohom<add place="above">m</add>ed never wrote the letter referred to, nor
any other letter to Captain Potter, but that this letter was
written by a fellow <unclear>S. J.</unclear> Abdallah, by his orders, and falsely
signed Mo<add place="above">m</add>ed. <unclear>Naming</unclear> got this information. Dr. Wilson
asked Captain Potter to send an officer with the letter to
Prince Mo<add place="above">m</add>ed to ascertain the fact. The "Lancaster" being
ready to sail and under steam no officer could go <del>on</del>
shore, and Captain Potter referred Dr. Wilson to the
Commandant of <unclear>Mayotte</unclear> who was on shore making
a treaty with S. Abdallah.</p>

<p>I was present when Dr. Wilson asked the Commandant
of <unclear>Mayotte</unclear> to call Prince Mohamed and make an
enquiry on this letter falsely signed by him. Commandant
of <unclear>Mayotte</unclear> declined to make any enquiry.</p>

<p>Mauritius, August 1st, 1886</p>

<p>I hereby certify that I was in Dr. Wilson's employ on
Patsy Estate for six years, and I have heard Sultan Abdallah
say on several occasions that he intended after Dr. Wilson
had got his estate in good working condition to drive Dr.
Wilson from the island, and get his estate away from him
and give it to his son <unclear>Salim</unclear>. He also promised to make
me manager of the estate if I would assist in getting Dr.
Wilson into difficulties. I am personally acquainted with
Sultan Abdallah, and used to be very intimate with him.
He commenced to try and deprive Dr. Wilson of labour in
1882 and took away all his own slaves first from Dr.
Wilson, and then of his Queen Boney Malala, about 60 in
number. He requested them to leave Patsy without
Dr. Wilson's knowledge, and go to his garden at <unclear>Germanda</unclear>
He then tried to get all Johannamen to take their slaves
from Dr. Wilson's employ. At the same time he ordered
all free labourers to leave, which they did, as they were
afraid of the sergeant of the Sultan if they did not
