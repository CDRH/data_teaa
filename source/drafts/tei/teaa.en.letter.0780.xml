<p>Sending two destitute missionaries

<p>U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar<lb/>
Mch 25th 1897</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir: I have the honor to bring to your
notice, that on the 27th of January last
I paid the passages from here to Monrovia,
in the German Str Karl Woermann, of two
destitute American Missionaries, <unclear>T.</unclear> Arndt aand
his Wife, which amounted to 202fcs.50c, and
I desire to know if I am entitled to any
compensation from the Government for this
seeming necessary act, as I do not know
what could have become of the parties
if I had not thus befriended them.</p>

<p>Mr Arndt appeared quite unexpectedly
before me on the 19th of January last, while
I was receiving a farewell visit from the English
Consul, then on his way to Teneriffe, and
at once stated the position that himself and 
wife were in. He said that he and his 
Wife were last from Tacoma, where I believe
they had been engaged in Mission Work

<pb facs="20170619_154200"/>

in the Methodist connection, but that
while there he had thought he should
be more usefully employed in Liberia, he
having had experience in mission work
among the colored people in Louisiana.
Upon application to the Society however
he was told that owing to a lack of
funds caused by the "hard times" he could
not at that time be sent out, and that 
the society was in too great straights
financially to think of adding to its
expenses. Nothing daunted however Mr Arndt
still kept his project in his mind,
until by one of the strangest of
chances a <sic>Norweigan</sic> Barque called
the Elisea arrived at Tacoma chartered
to load timber for this place. Mr Arndt
being himself of <sic>Norweigan</sic> extraction, made
the acquaintance of the Captain (Olsen) who
it appears at that time sympathised with
the objects he had in view, and offered
to take him and his wife as far as Dakar
free of expense. They accordingly embarked,
and after a pleasant passage of 3 1/2 months
<unclear>around</unclear> Cape Horn, they arrived duly

<pb facs="20170619_154205"/>

at Dakar, where they met with their
first disappointment in not finding the
place near to Liberia as they had
anticipated that it was. They had at the time of their arrival only
fifteen dollars left between them, and 
as the Captain of the Elisea had observed
before the end of the voyage that
Mrs Arndt was likely soon to be confined
with a child, he was betraying the
utmost anxiety to get them out of his 
vessel before the event should occur, claiming
that he was worthy of the greatest credit
for having brought them so far for
nothing.</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma I thought which 
exceeded the wildest dreams of romance;
are worthy to take place in the strange
African Continent. The narrator of all
this appeared to be a perfectly sane, fairly
well educated, and in all other particulars
a very respectable person, and his Wife,
whom I saw afterward, seemed perfectly adapted to him. What, under the
circumstances, was the proper thing to do?

<pb facs="20170619_154213"/>

The English Consul, who was soon
obliged to leave me for his steamer
was so astonished that he could
hardly recover his speech, and before
going away slipped me half a guinea
in gold as a contribution for assisting
in whatever I might find necessary to
be done.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to defend
the Consulate, which I did by telling
the man that as I understood my duty
I did not feel authorized to assist him
officially; that as he and the captain
he came with were responsible for his
being here, he had best arrange with
the captain for staying in the vessel until
he and his wife could reach a port in
some country where they would have
the sympathy and assistance of their
co-religionists. I told him that Monrovia
was more than 500 miles distant from
Dakar, that second-class passages for
himself and wife would cost $64.00,
and that in the condition his wife
was in, I thought it would be imprudent

<pb facs="20170619_154218"/>

for them to leave the vessel until they
could see the way clearer before them.</p>

<p>He left me for the vessel at Dakar
somewhat depressed but still calm &amp; dignified,
while I consulted with the authorities
to see if destitute passengers could be
prevented from landing. I found that
as there had been no precedent here
the authorities were not decided, and
learned soon after that the captain by
assuming an attitude of sternness had
got them to go ashore at Dakar, where
they had taken refuge, in a cheap, 
dirty, over-crowded boarding house,
the occupants of which were from
the lowest class of vicious Italian <sic>peddlars</sic>.</p>

<p>I could stand this no longer, and
going to the agent of the German Steamers
with whom I was well acquainted, I
found that on relating the principal
parts of the story to him he was in
full sympathy with me although a
Catholic, and agreed on a reduction
of a deck passage to Monrovia for
Mr Arndt from 60 fcs to 40 fcs. For

<pb facs="20170619_154224"/>

Mrs Arndt, considering the condition
she was in and what might happen
on the voyage I did not ask for
anything less than second-class, which
cost 162.50. I then sent for them to
leave the wretched den in which they
had taken refuge from the vessel which
brought them, and from which I knew
they would be ejected the moment
their money was finished, and come
over to Goree which was to be the 
calling place of the steamer. They came
to my house as directed, and as 
the steamer came along ahead of time
they were not detained at Goree quite
the whole of one day. The captain
of the steamer received them very kindly
on their introduction to him by the
kind-hearted agent, and although only
a deck passage at a reduced price had
been paid for <sic>for</sic> Mr Arndt, the captain
at once directed that they should make
the passage together in a state-room
without any reference to what had 
been paid for.</p>

<pb facs="20170619_154229"/>

<p>The Missionary, Mr Arndt, had frankly
told me before I did anything for
him that the Methodist Missionary
Society was not responsible for his
enterprise of trying to get to Liberia
on his own resources, but I nevertheless
thought it best to communicate with
Bishop Harzell, whom I supposed to
be still in Liberia, before writing the
Government. He replied as follows.
"I had no knowledge whatever of Mr Arndts
coming to our work here, and at present
have no funds to employ him * * * Hiss
wife &amp; he are at white plains near here.
* * They have a little son. * * * They seem
like good and reliable people".</p>

<p>Such is the way the case stands.
The persons assisted were Americans,
and without doubt in distress, but 
they were not "sailors". They resembled
the man of sailors only in being
imprudent. They were not even
vicious like the most of sailors,
but impressed an eminent discriminating
Christian like Bishop Harzell, as being

<pb facs="20170619_154235"/>

good reliable people. They would
very likely never have heard of me
nor I of them if I had not been
Consul, and so it is probably
because I am a consul that I 
was singled out to help them. I
could not help assisting them in
the circumstances in which I found
them placed because it was not
in nature that I should let such
people suffer when I had the means
to help them. But as I have
remarked, after all, they were
not sailors, and I am therefore
simply recounting the incident to
the Department, without being certain
as to whether anything can be done
about it or not</p>

<p>I am Sir<lb/>
Very truly Yours<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>
