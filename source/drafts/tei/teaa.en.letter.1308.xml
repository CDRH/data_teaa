<p>No. 68. <unclear></unclear> Consular.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia;
May 10, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
transmit, herewith, copies of
all correspondence, relative
to the estate of the late William
Parker, between James
(George by mistake on my
part) H. Lewis, the
Administrator of the esstate; the
State Department, Monrovia,
and this Consulate General.</p>

<p>By a close reading
of my letter to James H.
Lewis, the Administrator, in
whose house Parker, resided
and diedl you will observe
that</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4010.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>that I set up the claim
that Parker was and died
an American citizen. You
will further observe, that
James H. Lewis, the
Administrator, in none of his
replies, as Administrator;
denies my claim that
Parker was an American
citizen; but tacitly admits
my claim by promising to
forward the effects of the
deceased to this Consulate General.</p>

<p>In my No 4/1901, Miscellaneous,
January 29, 1901, to
the State Department, Monrovia;
complaining of the
silency and non action
of the Administrator; the
State Department, in reply
informed me that the
Attorney General, had been
instructed to correspond with
the said James H. Lewis,
the</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4011.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>the Administrator; advising
him to comply with the
terms of the law &amp;c.</p>

<p>In reply to the Attorney
General's letter; upon inquiry,
at the Executive Mansion, the
President informed me that
James H. lewis, the Administrator
had answered the
Attorney General; informing
him that he, James H.
Lewis, had sold the effects
of the deceased, and would
soon come down and make
a report to the Attorney General,
which he James H.
Lewis, the Administrator,
thought, would be satisfacotry
to the Attorney General.
Having reeived such
information from the President,
I demurred, at the
expressed desire to make
his report to the Attorney
General, and filed my
Protest,</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4012.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>Protest No. 10/1901, Miscellaneous,
March 16, 1901, to the State
Department, Monrovia.
To this Protest, the Liberian
Government, to date, has
failed to make a direct
reply, to this Consulate
General. It has, however,
indirectly, replied, by instructing
the Hon. R. J. B. Watson,
the Superintendent of Grand
Cape Mount Territory, to
cause the said James H.
Lewis,, the Administrator,
to make an immediate
report, transmitting the
proceeds &amp;c of said estate,
direct to me.</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of the
report of James H.
Lewis, the Administrator,
I was confined to my
bed, very sick; but without
opening the report; I directed
the Secretary of the Legation
to</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4013.jpg"/>

<p>7</p>

<p>to take the sealed packages
to the Attorney General of the
Liberian Government, open
the said packages, read
te report and varify the
statements, accounts &amp;c, and
bring the same back to
this Consulate General.</p>

<p>After reading the report,
finding them short in
many respects I wrote
my No. 13/1901. Miscellaneous,
April 16, 1901, to
which I have received
us reply, direct nor
indirectly, from the Liberian
Government.</p>

<p>Awaiting your instructions,
I have the honor
to be your obedient
servant,
Owen L. W. Smith,
C. General.</p>

<p>No. 4/1901. Miscellaneous
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
Jan. 29, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. W. V. Gibson,
Acting Secretary of State,
Monrovia</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to call
your attention to the fact that
Mn Parker late of Spokane, state
of Washington, United States
of America emigrated from the
United States to Liberia during
the summer of 1900, reaching
here in September 1900. He left
his wife and family in America.
He left this city in the latter
part of september for Cape Mount
Liberia, during the same month.
He stopped while in Cape Mount
with one James H. Lewis. It
appears that the Judge of
the monthly and Probate
Court of</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4015.jpg"/>

<p>of said Territory being the uncle
of said James H. Lewis, the sheriff
appointed him the administrator
of the estate and effects of the
deceased Wm Parker, with
authority to collect and settle the
estate of the deceased Wm Parker.</p>

<p>The intelligence of the death
of Wm Parker reached this
Legation during the latter part
of Nov. 1900. Whereupon I at once
communicated with the said
James H. Lewis the administrator
forbidding him to sell
the effects of the deceased, but
directing him to collect same
box them up and transmit
them to me at Monrovia,
accompanied with an inventory
and statement of three
respectable persons as
apprasiers, with statement of
expenses &amp;c for settlement
by the American Consul Generals
to Liberia.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4016"/>

<p>The said James H. Lewis has
since written to me asking
permission to sell the eeffects and
make settlements &amp;c as may
suite himself. He also asked
how he should forward the
residence of the said estate to me.
In reply I informed him that
I had no authority of law
by which I could authorize
him to sell said effects and
directed him to forward same
to me by Messrs. Houston
Brother's vessel. Having made
proper arrangements with
Messrs. Houston Brothers for
the transportation of said
effects, and delivered the letter
to Messrs Houston Brothers
to be delivered to Mr. Lewis upon
the arrival of said vessel at
Robertsport with the advice
to deliver said effects to the
captain of said vessel. Upon
the return of said vessel
Messrs</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4017.jpg"/>

<p>Messrs. Houston Brothers informed
me that they forwarded the letter
even before the sailing of the
vessel in order that Mr. Lewis
might have everything ready
for shipment upon the animal
of the vessel but upon animal
Mr. Lewis failed to deliver
the effects &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now I write to ask that
the said James H. Lewis Esq.,
be directed that he forward
the said effects without further
delay to me or show
just cause for his actions
in said matter.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant,
Owen L. W. Smith
M. R. and Consul General</p>

<p>No. 10/1901. Miscellaneous
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia, March 16, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. W. V. Gibson,
Acting Secretary of State,
Monrovia</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to say,
that this Consulate General,
having been informed during
the latter part of November,
1900, of the very sudden death
of the late William Parker an
American citizen, late of the
city of Spokane, State of
Washington, United States of
America, the said William
Parker having come to Liberia,
during the month of September,
1900, prospecting with a view
to locating here and becoming
a Liberian citizen in case
he found surroundings
favorable, the wife and
other</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4021.jpg"/>

<p>other heirs at law of the said
William Parker having been left
in the city of Minneapolis
State of Minnesota, United
States of America, awaiting
the full determination of
the said William Parker, as
to whether he would renounce
his allegiance to the Government
of the United States
and swer allegiance to
other Government, the said
William Parker however brought
many effects &amp;c. with him
such as a man of a prosper
disposition would have desc<gap reason="missing"/>
to have with him in case of
a final determination to settle
in this country, died Nov. 14, 1900,
in the residence and home
of one James H. Lewis a Liberian
citien of Robertsport, Territory
of Grand Cape Mount
Republic of Liberia. This
Consulate General was further</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4022.jpg"/>

<p>informed that the judge of the
montly and Probate Court of
said Grand Cape Mount Territory,
being the uncle of the said
James H. Lewis, appointed
him the said James H. Lewis
the administrator of the
effects &amp;c. of the late William
Parker deceased with authority
to sell the effects of the
deceased, settle his his estate
and transmit the residnce
of the effects to the widow
of the deceased William
Parker in America instead of
communicating the facts
of his death, and the forwarding
the effects of the deceased
to this Consulate General in
whose Consular District the
said William Parker died
Steaming of the Proceedings
of the Monthly and Probate
Court of said Territory in
said case, I at once in
accordance</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4023.jpg"/>

<p>accordance with the stipulated
duties of an American Consul
in a Christian Country as will
appear on page 154, paragraph
385 First United States
Consular Regulations, 1896
communicated with the
said James H. Lewis
informing him that he could not sell the effects of the deceased
nor transmit the proceeds
thereof to the widow of the
deceased in the United States
but that he should send said
effects with a duplicate
copy of an inventory of the
said effects of the deceased
with a bill of all necessary
expenses &amp;c to
this Consulate General
for settlement and transmission
to the United States.</p>

<p>In reply the said James H.
Lewis wrote me that he desired
to sell sufficient of the said
effects</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4024.jpg"/>

<p>effects of the deceased to settle
such claims as he held
against the deceased. I
again wrote him citing the
<unclear>provisions</unclear> of the law, page 161
paragraph 409, Consular Regulation
of said effects
to this Consulate General and again so notified
said James H. Lewis.</p>

<p>Receiving no reply
from him, I laid the matter
before the State Department
Monrovia for immediate
action in the case as I
had not been and am not yet placed in a
position to make a proper
report to my Government
owing to the arbitrary
and dictory of the said
James H. Lewis.</p>

<p>Now since your
Government through the Department
of Justice has communicated with</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4025.jpg"/>

<p>with the Judge of the Montly
and Probate Court of said
Territory on with James H.
Lewis relative to said effects
and demanding the said
effects be forwarded to this
Consulate General, I am
further informed that the
said James H. Lewis some
days after the receipt of
the order from the Attorney
General did expose and
sell the said effects of
the deceased William Parker
and has written the Attorney
General that he (James H. Lewis
at his own convenience)
would come down adn
make a report to the
Attorney General who knows nothing of the
effects of the deceased
William Parker the which he (james H. Lewis) thinks
will be satisfactory to the Attorney General.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4026.jpg"/>

<p>The said James H. Lewis in
accepting the responsibility of
becoming the administrator
of the estate of the deceased
American citizen, dying
in this Consular District
thus becomes a quasisubordinate
Consular Officer
of the United States in this
case is amenable to this
Consulate General for his administration of the
affairs of the estate of a
deceased American citizen
and the full and faithful
accomability thereof to this
Consulate General. Therefore
as Consul General of the
United States to Liberia
under whose supervision
the effects of deceased
American citizens dying
within the limits of this
Consular District some
I claim that James H. Lewis
has</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4027.jpg"/>

<p>has no authority under the
country of international
law to make such an
indicated desired report
upon such a matter
affecting the honest intentions
of two soverign nations <gap reason="missing"/>
the Attorny General on to
the State Department suparate
and apart from the
representative of the other
power who holds a list
and has a knowledge
of much of the personal
effects of the deceased
American citizen, as many
articles of the effects of the
deceased were on deposit
in the Consulate General up
to the day of the departure of 
of the deceased firm this city
for Robertsport. For the foregoing <unclear></unclear>
such indicated desired exparte
proceedings on the part of said James H. Lewis.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant
Owen L. W. Smith
Consul Gen.</p>

<p>Copy</p>

<p>No. 19/1901. Miscellaneous.
Legation of the United States.
Monrovia, Liberia
April 16, 1901.</p>

<p>Hom. W. V. Gibson,
Acting Secretary of State,
Monrovia</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to say,
that in relation to the effects
of the late William Parker
deceased, that the very incomplete
report of James H. Lewis Esq.,
the administrator of the said
effects and the Sheriff of Grand
Cape Mount Territory is by no
means satisfactory to this
Consulate General nore to the
Government of the United States.
To particularize, First, the
administrator charges the
estate with two dollars for the
services of two appraisers for
dollars and seventy-five cents,
to</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4029.jpg"/>

<p>to clerk of Court for according
the inventory; yet he utterly fails
to give this Consulate General
any report of the work of the
appraisers or a duplicate
certified copy of the Inventory.
I therefore ask that the said
James H. Lewis be demanded
to furnish this Consulate General
direct or through the
Department of State with a
certified copy of the original
findings and estimates of
the aforesaid appraisers
for which the estate of
the aforesaid William Parker
is charged, or the original
Inventory as reported to the
Court in duplicate, certified
by the clerk of said court,
as being a true and faithful
copy of the said original
inventory.</p>

<p>Second. The said James
H. Lewis, in his capacity as</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4030.jpg"/>

<p>administrator of the estate of
the late William Parker, did expose
for sale and did sell all the
valuable effects of the deceased
William Parker, as per his report
as administrator amounting
to Ninety-Seven 40/100 dollars ($97.40)
yet he failed to accompany
his report with a copy of the
Bill of Sales, giving an itemized
account, stating for what amount
each article of said estate sold.
The missing itemized Bill of Sales;
showing what articles in the
list of Inventory he sold, the
prices obtained for each
article &amp; c. I do most respectfully
ask that you demand of the said James H. Lewis
and that the same be furnished
this Consulate General.</p>

<p>Third. The said James H. Lewis
in his report as administrator
changes the estate of the deceased
William Parker for accounts claimed</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4031.jpg"/>

<p>claimed to have been paid by
the said administrator, against
the estate of the deceased and
for his services rendered
including 5 percent
commission, the sum of Fifty-six
13/100 dollars and yet
he fails to substantiate a single
item claimed to have been
paid by him by the presentation
of any accompanying
receipt or voucher given by
the party or parties receiving
said amounts. I therefore
ask that the said James H.
Lewis be damanded to furnish
said receipts or vouchers
or refund the entire amount paid by him less his command
$16.25.</p>

<p>Fourth. Knowing as I do the
very miserly manner in
which the deceased William Parker
before he went to Robertsport
brought to this Consulate General
for</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4032.jpg"/>

<p>for safe keeping. Two hundred
and twenty dollars in
unconvertable American Express Company's
Certificates of Credit
wrapped and closely bound
together with, in the same
package Â£30 sterling and
two American Ten dollars
gold pieces, making a totla
of One Hundred and Sixty-four
dollars in coins besides the
Two Hundred and Twenty dollars
in Certificates of Credit: and
that on the Morning of September
27, 1900; the day that the
deceased left the city for
Robertsport, he called at this Consulate
General, called for and received
the said money and money
credits or certificates and
did most carefully wrap
and find the money and
money credits together
even before leaving this Consulate General, making it
almost</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4033.jpg"/>

<p>almost next to impossible for
my one to have obtained money
credits or certificates without
having obtained the Â£30 sterling
and the two American Ten Dollar
gold pieces. And whereas the
said James H. Lewis in all of
his correspondence with
me relative to the estate
of the deceased has observed
entire reticency
touching the One Hundred
and sixty-four dollars in
com and even in his
report to me as administrator
of the effects of the
deceased notwithstanding
he forwarded to me Two
Hundred and Twenty dollars
in incomentable Certificates
of Credit yet he says not
a word relative to the Â£30
sterling, and the two American
Ten Dollar pieces or the
One Hundred and Sixty-four</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4034.jpg"/>

<p>dollars in coin. I therefore
claim that the acknowledged
possession and presentation
of the Two Hundred and
Twenty DOllars in
unconventable certificates by
the said administrator. James
H. Lewis, aforesaid is prima
facie evidence that he is or
has been in possession of
the Â£30 Sterling and the Two
American Ten Dollar gold
pieces. Again his entire
reticency relative to the
Â£30 sterling and the Two
American Ten dollar gold
pieces referred to in my
first letter to the said
James H. Lewis relative to
the effects of the deceased
William Parker and making
no mention of <unclear></unclear>
in his report as administrator
is presumptive evidence
that he is or has been in
possession</p>

<pb n="Rol6-4035.jpg"/>

<p>of the Â£30 Sterling and the two
American Ten Dollar gold pieces.
I therefore ask that the said
James H. Lewis be suspended
from all offices of trust
and profit, and that his bondsmen
as administrator of
the estate of the late William
Parker be attached for the default
of the said administrator
in the full and faitful
discharge of the duties of
said office, and that the
said James H. Lewis be
apprehended and
confined in the common
jail or jails of this
Republic until full restitution
for the said Â£30 sterling and
the two American ten dollars gold
pieces is made.</p>

<p>Awaiting your reply, I have
the honor to be your obedient
servant,
Owen L. W. Smith.
Consul General.</p>

<p>No. 21 (f)/1900</p>

<p>Miscellaneous
Legation of the United States
Monrovia, Liberia, Nov. 26, 1900.</p>

<p>James H. Lewis, Esq.,
Robertsport (Cape Mount)
Liberia.</p>

<p>Sir: I have the honor to say
that I am just apprised
of the death Nov. 13, 1900, of
William Parker, late of Spokane,
state of Washington
U.S.A. I am further
informed by His Honor
Judge H. W. Travis, that
you have been appointed
the administrator of the
effects &amp;c of Mr. Parker, and
have been advised to take
an inventory of the effects
&amp;c., collect all debts &amp;c. due
the deceased, pay all debts
due by the deceased sell
the</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4037.jpg"/>

<p>the residence of said effects &amp;c.
and send the proceeds thereof
to the widow of the
deceased. As Mr. Parker was in
all probability (as he was
when he left here for Cape
Mount) an American citizen,
and his surviving heirs are
still in America I am in
duty bound to intervene
so far as to ask that you
do not sell any of his effects
unless there be such as may
be classed as perishable
goods, that will be spoiled
before they can reach this Legation.</p>

<p>Neither are you authorized
to settle his accounts by law
but you will in the discharge
of your duty as administrator
of the effects of William Parker
deceased, first take two other
reputable persons with yourself
making a committee
of three reputable persons,
who</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4038.jpg"/>

<p>who with yourself will take an
accurate account of everything,
including money, letters, books,
and photos left by the deceased.
You will make three copies
of this inventory, each copy of
which should be signed by all
three of the committee.</p>

<p>You will retain one copy and
send two copies signed by all
three of the committee to me.</p>

<p>All his effects, including money,
or money's value (a copy of which
he filed in this legation before
leaving for Cape Mount find enclosed).</p>

<p>You will cause to be boxed or
locked up in trunks or other
cases &amp;c. transported to this
legation.</p>

<p>You will also submit
reasonable bills for necessary
expenses, services rendered
&amp;c to this Legation with the effects of the deceased for

<p>To his Honorable
Owen L. W. Smith, U.S. Minister,
Liberia.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:
Your of the 26th of November
to hand and contents
noticed, and in reply I beg to
say that your letter was very
much appreciated but at
the same time, I had already
submitted to what the judge
of the Probate Court had ordered
me to do. It was something
new for me although I have
served as administrator
and appraiser in several
estates but not of this kind.
Brother William Parker
arrived here 28th of September
1900 and died 14th Nov.
1900, he was speechless a while
day and died without uttering</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4041.jpg"/>

<p>uttering a word. His key could
not be found and we had to
brake his trunk upon in
order to get his cloths for to
dress heirs. Two days after
he was burried, we came
across his keys in the mattress that he slept in, but
having received further
orders from you countermanding
that of the Judge
of the Probate Court, ordering
me to send the things down
to you, I therefore submit
to you orders as United
States Minister but before
doing so I am hereby sending
the bills from the estate desiring
you to arrange some way for
payment as the parties are
crouding on me for their money
or authorize me to settle the
out of the effects. Also
inform me how to get the things
down to Monrovia as expenses
will</p>

<p>No. 22/1900 Miscellaneous.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia, Dec. 11. 1900.</p>

<p>James H. Lewis, Esq.
Robertsport.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have to acknowledge
the receipt of your favor
of Dec. 6, 1900, asking me
for permission to settle
certain accounts against
the Estate of William
Parker to the amount of $39.68.</p>

<p>In reply I have no authority
in law to give you such power.
I advised you according to
law how to proceed and
what to do with the effects
of the deceased. To deviate
from these rules will be the
means of International
disputes between the United States
Government and the Liberian
Government.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4045.jpg"/>

<p>You must forward the
effects with reasonable charges
to this Legation for settlement
&amp;c. You must give the name
of each person as well as
the amount due each;
stating for what the Estate
due each person. I am to
send a copy of your statment
&amp;c to the Secretary of the
Treasury at Washington in my
final settlement of the
estate.</p>

<p>I have been informed
that the lodge caused for
and furnished brother Parker.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant,
Owen L. W. Smith,
M. R. and C. General</p>
