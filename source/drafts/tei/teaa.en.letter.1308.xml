<p>No. 69. Consular.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia;
May 15, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor
to acknowledge the
receipt May 13, 1901, of your
No. 33, Consular, of April
10, 1901, informing me that
"the Department greatly
prefers Mr. Spurgeon's
appointment, to the position
of Vice Consul General,
rather than that of a foreigner."</p>

<p>In reply, I have to say
I regret exceedingly much
to have to give my reasons
for withholding my indorsement
and recommendation
of</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4048.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>of Mr. Spurgeon for the Vice
Consul Generalship; especially
so, inasmuch as he has
just, a few days since, sailed for America, and is
not here to see my reply;
in order, if he so desires to
file his answer. However,
as he sailed by a very slow
schedule, it may be possible,
that this dispatch may
be dispatched by a fast
German steamer; and may
thereby, reach Wasington
before he does, in order, that
he may be shown my
objections &amp;c, while in Washington.</p>

<p>First. I refer you to my
No. 67, Consular, of April
15, 1901.</p>

<p>Second, My immediate
official association with
Mr. SPurgeon, as Secretary
of the Legation, for the last
three years, has convinced me</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4049.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>me (1) of his very careless
and neglectful disposition;
(2) of his insubordinate,
presumption and selfwellness.
Notwithstanding, your No. 32,
Consular, of March 12, 1901,
and my No. 67, Consular,
of April 15, 1901, in reply;
in evidnece of my assertion
of his carelessness, insubordinale
and presumptive
disposition I will enclose
herewith, a copy of an 
undated, unnumbered and
recorded dispatch prepared
by the Secretary of the Legation
the contents of which
I had no knowledge, as he
had not, at that time,
asked my approval, as to
what time he could leave
the Legation; until I discovered
it in the Despatch
Book, the day after it was
recorded, admonished him
for</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4050.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>for such persistency and
demanded that it be cancelled
and not dispatched; and
in lieu thereof I wrote and
dispatched my No. 125,
Diplomatic of May 10, 1901.
As asserted in my No. 67,
Consular of April 15, 1901,
Mr. Spurgeon never asks
my consent nor advice,
relative to anythinng he
desires to do, in connection
with the duties of the Legation;
but when he has
decided to do; as in the case
of his determination to leave
the Legation and the city
April 9, 1901; he simply
informs me, at the last
moment, as he did in
this instant come to my
bedside Monday afternoon,
April 8, 1901, and
told me he had previously
arranged to spend two
or</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4051.jpg"/>

<p>7</p>

<p>or three weeks, with friends
in the interior, before he
sailed for America; and
would therefore, leave on
Tuesday morning April
9, 1901. I was quit sick
and helpless, at the time;
had no power, or authority,
by which I could restrain
him, and was therefore,
forced to silently, acquiesce.</p>

<p>Third. For me to have
indorced or recommended
Mr. Spurgeon for the Vice
Consul Generalship, would
have conveyed to the
Department, my indorcement
and recomendation
of Mr. Spurgeon
for his reappointment as
Secretary of this Legation
for another term of honorable
service.</p>

<p>And as my personal
and official experiences
with</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4052.jpg"/>

<p>8</p>

<p>with him, do not warrant
nor justify me in indorsing
or recommending him
for the Vice Consul Generalship,
I could not honestly
and conscientiously indorse
nor recommend him for
reappointment as Secretary 
of this Legation. I have to
say, however, that I will
acquiesce in whatever may 
be the pleasure of the Department,
toching this very
important matter.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be your obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith,
Consul General.</p>

forms to the Minister's bedside and
there hold up one form after another
until the Minister had selected
such as he desired for the occasion
