<p>Legation of the Republic of Liberia
                    Yonkers, N.Y.
                     April 7, 1866</p>

<p>    I have the honor to acknowledge
   receipt of your lettersof 26th ult. and of
   5th instant, the latter recognizing Mr. Wm
   Coppinger as Chief of this Legation.</p>

<p>    I beg to inform you that I have received
   from the Liberian government a special com
   mission, iwht full powers to negotiate with
   the government of the United States for
   the purchase of a steam gun boat of not 
   over 150 tons. One of not over 120 tons
   with one eighteen pound pivot gun would
   be most suitable.</p>

<p>     The govt. of Liberia is particularly
   anxious to have such a vessel for other
   reasons besides teh suppression of the slave
   trade, having, (since the disability of the
   schooner Quail theirs only gun vessel) suffered</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0183.002"/>

<p>for many monthsdgreat inconvenience in the
   collection of revenue and the enforcement of
   order among the tribes on different parts of
   their coast, and much annoyance <unclear/>
   out of difficulties between foreigners and
   the natives within their jurisdiction <unclear/>
   they would have been saved from had
   not the Quail been disabled.</p>

<p> Libera having been colonized <unclear/>
   exclusively by persons without capital, <unclear/>
   (unlike any country newly sealed by whites
   not having the benefit of foreign capital <unclear/>
   into it (for their )race in other countries,
   few excpetions, have but little) is compelled 
   to much economy and yet its great 
   need of a vessel, renders the government
   of LIberia willing to incur a debt for <unclear/></p>

<p>     The government Liberia is
   conscious that pecuniary considerations
   could not move the government of >
   United States to transfer a gun boat
   and yet the bill, as it has passed</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0183.003"/>

<p>Senate, seems to me to restrict and limit the
   discretion of the Executive Department so that 
   no other consideration can be admitted in arranging for the transfer.</p>

<p>     It would be happy for Liberia and more 
   in accordance wiwth her pecunniary resources,
   if the bill would be modified so as to allow 
   other considerations to be admitted in fiding 
   the coast, for instance, the convenience she would
   afford to the United States govenrment in pro-
   viding more frequent communications with
   any fleet or vessels on her coast s she
   would be kept in as frequent intercourse as
   possible with all parts of it, and as the
   Liberians (as President Warner in a late
   letter says) "are in feelings, sentiment and
   disposition, America.</p>

<p>     The United States being engaged with
   Great Britain in the suppression of the
   slave trade, could effect much with such
   a boat in the hands of the Libera Government
   without the expense of keeping her in</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0183.004"/>

<p>commission, an expense probably annually
   equally to her value, possibly England was
   induced by some such considerations in <unclear/>
   to generosity in the gift of the Qual.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be with the
   highest consideration. Sir
   your most obedient servant.
            H.M. Scheiffelin</p>

<p>     Hon. W.H. Seward
               Secretary of State
                Washington
                    D.C.</p>
