Consulate of the United States of America, at Sierra Leone 
16th March 1866

Sir,

I have the honor to inform the Department of a great and important change in Her Majesty's Government with regard to the colonies of her <unclear> discussion </unclear> on this Coast.

The four colonies Gambia, Sierra Leone, (this Colony includes the Sherbro Island and a very large part of the <unclear> mariland </unclear> inferior of the island and <unclear/> as the Sherbro Country) Lagos and Cape Coast, which <unclear> heretofor </unclear> have fear seperate Governments, are now counsolidated in one, under a Governor General His Excellency <unclear/> Wensley Blackall, united this change Governor

To the
Hon W.H. Seward
Secretary of State

of the Colony of Sierra Leone. 

His residence will be in this city, (Freetown) which ill, becaue of its central position, and commercil importance be the head-granted of the new style of Governnment.

I respectfully desire to request the department to inform me, if section 420, in Chapter 26 of the Consular Regulations which reads thus, "Consuls gener "al are entitled to a salute of "nine guns, consuls to a salute "of seven guns, vice consuls, "consular agents, commercial a "gents, and vice commercial "agents, to . salute of five guns;" is now in force.

The U.S.S. "Kearsarge", Commander Q.D.Harrell, arrived in this port on the 4th of March last, I visited the vessel, and on leaving received no salute, governing myself by the above section of the Consular regulations, I wrote to commander Harrell asking his reasons for with-holding the usual salute, and received in answer, "I have "to say in reply,that although "I have thirty years experience "in the <unclear/>, I have never seen "an office of your grade (Consular "Agent) saluted. According to the"Naval regulations, I am not permitted to salute any <unclear/> felon the rank of Consul." this is my reason for desiring information on the subjects, because of my regulations and it is necessary I should have them, as Commander Harrell told me, U.S. vessels of war would, hereafter, frequently visit this first for the <unclear/> of coaling.

This is the first vessel of war of the United States which was visited this port service the date of my commission in September 1866, and as others are <unclear/>, I desire to be <unclear/> acquainted with all that is required of me, and all that is due  to me, in my official intercourse with such vessles, of chapeter 26 in the regulations does not cover the whole subject.

I forgot to mention that the island of Bulano, at the mouth if the Rio Grande river, is a dependency of this colony of Sierra Leone.

I would recommend, where sending official paper is a felow like this, it should be white, as the blue deteriates very rapidly.

I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obedt servant
Henry Rider
U.S. Counsular Agent
