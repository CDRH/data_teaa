(Document Repeated in 0215)

O'eloek we were told by outside officials, much to own disappointment, that the 
Secretary would not be at his office that day; so I left my card and went away.
I called after the next day, and after waiting until after twelve o'clock. I was
ushered into the presence of the Secretary whom I found standing up, and he 
said to me wen on entering the room. "I can only give you a few moments, as the new 
Spanish Minister is now waiting, by appointment to be conducted over, to be 
introduced to the President". I then said, "The Secretary then asked once to call
again the next day and he told his usher to 'bring one ripher* in", as soon as he got to the 
office". I called the next day, but the Secretary did not go to his office that day 
which was a Saturday, and I called the following Monday and Tuesday with the 
same *sesul that then left Washington, and from Philadephia I had written
a letter to Secretary to which was expecting an answer".

They then said that I had not been treated nicely by the Secretary, and that, "If you
had a commissioner from one of the Great Powers, the Secretary would have
found time to attend to you. The gentlemen, whom I went to see then said to
his friend was connected with the Press, and that something ought to be said about 
N. Heis friend replied."Yes I'll show Blaine up" ! I replied, "I beg that you will 
do us such thing, as consider that Mr. Blaine treated me very courteous 
and I consider that he showed me special honor in granting once our 
interior at all, under all the circumstances, and when so many others 
had been waiting so much longer than I to get an interview with him"
"One of the gentlemen found waiting to see the Secretary told me that he had
been visiting the Department for fourteen days consectively, and had 
mayor been favored with an interview; on of the officials told me that the 
Secretary was conferring with Delegations from the South American Pl**
about commercial treaties that he wished to make with them and if
they often went to his residence to confer, and thus caused them to be 
when from thr Department for several days consentiality. I said I felt quite sure 
that if the Spanish Minister had not then been waiiting Mr. Blaine would have 
heard all that I had to say on the subject of my mission. "Here the communication
about my visit to Washington ended, the other reason left, and the gentlemen and 
went on to talk of the matters, about which I had called his office.

From my conversation with those men, judged that they were both, political opponents 
of yourself and your division that; and when I saw that *artileiu "The World" I
at once wrote a letter to the Editor repredmating* the article as being false in every 
essential statement, and if I were now in the U.S. I think I should endevaur* to 
bring on action against the Editor for liked in publishing it. I sent that 
letter to Mr. Rothery of 116 Walnut Street, Philadelphia and have requested him, if "The World"
will not publish it, to have it published in some paper of that city, and to see
that it be brought to your notice, so that you might see that I have done what
I could do to remove any wrong impression that may have been made about you, 
by this *aporshy misquoting and mistating, what I said, and what I did ***
say about yourself.

Enclosed, please find a copy of my official report made to my Government on 
my arrival home and hope I was aware of the exsistence of that lying article 
in "The World", which I hope will convince you that I could not have made
the false statements which that article represents me as making 

With profound respect,
I have the honor to be 

Sir, 
Your obident servant
Nelley Davis
Late Liberian Commpr***
