Washington Feby 9th 1859

Sir,

I have been permitted to read the reply of John e. Taylor, U.S. Consul at Sierra Leone, now on file in your Department, to a comlaint made against him, by one, for conniving to defraud the United States.

He admits the substantial facts charged by me, but endeavors, with great circumstances, to convince you of his innocency in the transaction, an attempt in which I think he has signally failed. He has not even manlinessto acknowledge has ever, or volunteer to regret for his conduct. 

That he is willy unfit for the place he holds is an admitted fact by all I have heard speak upon the subject, and I trust his appointment will not be forwarded. 

Very Respectfully
Your Act Servt
<unclear/> Danforth Jr.

Hon John Appleton
Assistant Secretary of State
