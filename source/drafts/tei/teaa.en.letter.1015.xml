<p>Liberian Commerce
and Agriculture.</p>

<p>The commerce of the country
during the year was much
impaired by the recent depression
in trade. The palmoil, pam
kernals, coffee, and ginger, having
fallen below their market values;
have discouraged the Natives to
such an extent, that they refuse
to make the palm oil, palm Kernals,
and plant their ginger crop. 
The Americo-Siberian Farmers
-the greater bulk- have neglected to
clean their coffee plantations; and
gather their coffee crop. The 
nominal sum of twenty five cents per
gallon, for palm oil in trade
goods, which is equivalent to</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1053.jpg"/>

<p>twelve cents per gallon United
States currency. Palm Kernals
Eighty cents per bushel, which is
equivalent to FOrty cents per bushel
United States currency. Coffee
and ginger ten cents per pound
which is also equivalent to five
cents United States currency. All
tend to discourage the makers and
producers. The refusal of the Natives
and Americo-Siberians, to make,
and, gather, these important
articles of commerce, of which there
are no other substitutes for their
deficiencies, has caused a considerable
decrease, in the commerce of 
the country. Tjere was a considerable
quantity of American provisions 
and dry goods shiped via</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1054.jpg"/>

<p>Hamburg to Siberia in German 
steamers by American agencies in
Hamburg and in return the
palm oil, and palm Kernals were 
shipped to Hamburg sold and 
proceeds shipped to the United
States; but owing to the depression
of trade, there has been quite
a decrease in this Americo-German
trade with Siberia. There is a great
demand for American goods in
Liberia, and her interior settlements,
but owing to the lack of steam 
communication between the United
States and Liberia; and the lack
of a demand in the United States,
for the raw products of Liberia,
Liberian merchants are compelled
to carry on the greatest</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1055.jpg"/>

<p>bulk of their trade, with the
English manufacturers of Manchester,
and Liverpool. There is likely
to be a further decrease, in the 
price of coffee, the coming season.
The English market where the 
greatest bulk of Siberian coffee
is shipped, is being flooded
with a great quantity, Brazilian,
Java, &amp; Venezuelian coffee,
which, in size, strength, or flavor, 
but in curing. The Liberian Farmers
not taking the necessary <add>care</add> in curing
their coffee for the market <add>which</add>causes 
the coffee to be depreciated in value.
This is also the case with the ginger,
which is not allowed the necessary
time for drying, hence when</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1056.jpg"/>

<p>packed, shipped, and sold is inferior
to the ginger of other countries.</p>

<p>Agriculture.</p>

<p>This important branch of 
industry, has taken a sudden 
vise during the year; Owing I
<unclear>suppase</unclear> to the depression of
trade. The people-especially
the heathen Liberians- have
seen fit to employ themselves
in this branch of industry. 
Throughout the county of
Montserrado, which is the 
largest county in Siberia, can
be seen hundreds of acres, 
of rice, and corn and
numerous other tropical
vegetables, under cultivation.</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1057.jpg"/>

<p>So numerous were these articles
of home consumption that they
were offered at the capital
Monrovia - for trade goods-
from pots, tobacco, brass kettles,
powder, <unclear>zuns</unclear> &amp; Gin which
were never sold before but for
United States Green backs or coins,
English, Dutch, &amp; German Gold,
and Siberian Coppers, Many
of these tropical vegetables could
become important articles of
commerce, especially the cassada
which makes a starch much 
superior arrowroot. There is
also a great abundance of
arrowroot which grows wild
could be cultivated and made
an important article of</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1058.jpg"/>

<p>commerce. There are much wealth,
and treasures, hidden and undeveloped,
in Siberia; which American 
Capitalists, Manufacturers,
Agriculturalists, and Mineralogists,
could utilise for their benefit;
and increase American commerce.
There is no reason why 
they United States could not
control the great bulk of Liberian
trade. If Americans would
exert themselves in this direction
there would be much gain to us.
The people- Americo-Liberians and
Heathen Liberians, all prefer
American goods and would
far rather exchange with the
Americans than with those they do.</p>
