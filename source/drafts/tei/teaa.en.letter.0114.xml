St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
27th May 1878.</dateline></opener>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to 
report to the Department that
on the 21st of April last there
arrived here from Mosamedes
(or Little Fish Bay) an
American Seaman named 
St. Clair Monteith who states
according to the signed statement 
in my possession "that he shipped
on board the Bark "Pioneer"
at New Bedford, Captain 
Alexander Tripp, on the 14th
August 1877, and sailed the 
same day for the coast of
Africa on a Whaling trip. that 
he was obliged to leave her at
Mossamedes owing to questions
he had on board with the crew,
Thro the kindness of the Captain
of the Port at Mossamedes he 
obtained a passage on board a
Schooner bound for this city" &amp; 
on his arrival presented himself
at this Consulate declaring
himself to be perfectly destitute
and without any means of 
returning to America or Europe
<catchwords>After</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0114.002"/>

After being here a few days
he has taken sick with fever &amp;
on the 10th day it was found necessary
to send him to the Hospital
where he recovered. As there
was not any likelihood of an 
American Vessel arriving here
for some time and as keeping
him here incurs large expenses. I
determined upon sending him
home to Liverpool per the 
African Steam Ship Compys
steamer "Biafra", which sailed
hence on the 18th inst. and as
the Captain consented to take 
him for  &#163;10, and I have
consequently drawn on the Department,
in favor of the African
Steam Ship Co for $48.60/100 at 
15 days sight, under date 18th
May 1878.</p>

<p>When rendering my
Quarterly <unclear/> I will send the 
necessary vouchers pertaining to 
this.</p>
