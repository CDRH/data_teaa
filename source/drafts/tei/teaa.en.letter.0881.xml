<p>Washington, 22 Jan '62</p>

<p>Hon Horace Maynard,</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<p>I beg to call your attention to the
fact that in April, 1859 the Brig E. N. Roye
applied for entry at the Port of New York, under
the Liberian flag.</p>

<p>Altho' American Vessels in the Ports of
Liberia are not subject to discriminating
duties of tonnage, the Roye was compelled
to pay not only a tonnage duty, but also
an extra duty upon her cargo (African Produce)
in view of the fact that the Republic of
Liberia was unrecognised by us.</p>

<p>By an act approved 24 May 1828, (See
US Statutes at large vol 4, ¶ 308) the President
when satisfied that no discriminating duties
are levied upon American Vessels in
the Ports of a Foreign Nation, may issue
his proclamation, admitting the vessels of
that Nation on terms of Equality with our
own, in our own Ports, And I beg

<pb n="Image0012.jpg"/>

to call yr attention to proof of that fact
as furnished in a certificate of the US
Commercial Agent at Monrovia, the Capital
of Liberia, which I enclose, and also
to state that further proof may be found
in official despatches from Mr Seys, at 
the State Department.</p>

<p>I write this simply as one interested
pecuniarily in the subject, as I have no
doubt of retaliatory legislation on the part
of Liberia, if justice be much longer
delayed, by which I shall be obliged, with
others, to abandon the field to English &amp;
Germans, whose constant aim seems to
be to drive American Commerce from
the Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>These facts I have laid before the Prest.
in a communication handed to the Asst
Sec'y of State, this day, &amp; I entreat you
to aid in any possible way, in rendering
gracefully an act of International Comity, 
which w'd much better suit the Liberians
than a bare "recognition" upon philanthropic
grounds, as is proposed in some quarters

<pb n="Image0013.jpg"/>

by coupling Liberia with Hayti, when
almost the only interest in common is
that of Colour.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Very respy yrs<lb/>
Charles P. Clark<lb/>
of Boston, U.S.</p>
