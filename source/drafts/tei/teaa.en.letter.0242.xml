<p>Consulate of the United States
of America at Sierra Leone<lb/>
31st December 1861.</p>

<p>Sierra Leone yearly report.</p>

<p>I have the honor to forward 
the following report in accordance 
with the consular instructions 
as contained in the 153rd and 154th 
sections of the consular regulations.</p>

<p>The colony of Sierra Leone 
ceded to the English in the year 
1787 by the native Temaneh chiefs 
embraces an extent of about 500 
square miles, its southern point Cape 
Shilling lies in about 8° 10' N latitude 
and its southern point Freetown lies 
in about 8° 30' N., it is mostly mountainous 
land having an elevation 
of from 2000 to 2500 feet above the 
level of the sea, it was first settled 
by a party of free blacks 
<catchwords>from</catchwords>

<pb n="37"/>

from Nova Scotia in the year 
1792 and their descendents are 
to this day called settlers, in the Colony.</p> 

<p>The colony is divided into 
four districts the 1st and 2nd Eastern 
comprising the <sic>vilages</sic> of 
Kissy, Welington, Hastings, Newlands, 
Allentown, Rokelle, Frasertown; 
Denham, and Waterloo, 
the mountain district comprising 
Wilberforce, Murrytown, Aberdeen 
Gloucester, Bathurst, Regent and 
Charlotte, the Banana islands, 
dependencies of the Colony are also 
included in this district and 
have the small <sic>vilages</sic> of Dublin 
and Ricketts on them, the Western 
district includes the <sic>vilages</sic> 
of Hamilton, York, Goodrich and 
Kent, each district is under the 
charge of officer styled manager 
who is accountable to the 
colonial government in Freetown 
the sea-port and capitol of 
the

<pb n="38"/>

colony.</p>

<p>The government of the Colony 
is vested in the Governor, and a 
council of seven members, all 
of whom hold colonial appointments 
under the home government 
with the exception of one, 
a merchant of the colony, the 
following are the gentlemen of 
the council, John Carr Chief Justice, 
E. H. Beccles, Bishop, A Fitzjames 
Queens advocate, Geo W. Nicol 
Colonial secretary, T <unclear extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> 
Collector, R. Bradshaw Colonial 
Surgeon, and Charles Heddle merchant, 
all of whom are styled honorable, 
they are only responsible 
to the home government, 
and the laws they pass and submitted 
to the Queen and confirmed 
by her before the colonists 
are aware of their <sic>existance</sic>, the 
people of the colony have no 
voice whatever in their government, 
neither in the election of 
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="39"/>

the members of council above mentioned.</p>

<p>The commerce of the colony 
has fallen off considerably the past 
year in consequence of the American 
difficulties, and a failure 
of the ground-nut crop.</p>

<p>For a list of the imports and exports 
of this colony I would refer 
you to the annual report from 
this consulate for the year 1860.</p>

<p>The imports from the United 
States for the present 
year show a fair average 
with those of past years, 
if the general state of commerce 
is taken into consideration, the 
colony being to a great extent 
dependent on the United States 
for several of the staple articles 
of its trade our difficulties 
have naturally interfered with 
the general facilities of trade, the 
following table gives a correct idea 
of the imports for the present year.</p>

<p>The excess of importations over

vessels taking special and Native 
gold, which is not reported, and 
also by the reshipment of American

<p>The ground-nut crop for the 
past year has been a complete failure, 
in good seasons this is a very 
important item in the commerce of 
the colony and attracts a large amount 
of French tonnage for its 
<catchwords>exportation,</catchwords>

<pb n="43"/>

Exportation, this article finds 
its best market in France and 
in consequence of the very heavy 
differential duties in that country 
imposed on all foreign vessels 
the carrying is monopolized 
by French shipping. </p>

<p>There has been considerable 
of the land about this colony 
ceded to the English during the 
past year.</p>

<p>The territory in the Sherbro 
country known as Bendo was 
ceded to this colony by Thomas 
Stephen Caulker, Sherbro chief, and 
H.M.S.S Falcon, Commander Heneage 
took formal possession of it on 
the 28th of March by hoisting the 
English flag and firing a royal 
salute.</p>

<p>Tuesday April 2nd A treaty was 
concluded, between Governor Hill 
of this colony and a native chief 
styling himself Beh-Cantah 
King of Quia. By this treaty a 
<catchwords>portion</catchwords>

<pb n="44"/>

portion of the Quia country directly 
inland of the colony, about 
16 miles long and 10 miles wide 
is ceded to the colony, the King 
of Quia receiving an annual 
stipend of £100 as an equivalent</p>

<p>Many of the chiefs of the Quia 
country and especially those owning 
the particular portion of land 
refuse to acknowledge the treaty 
as they were not consulted with 
regard to it and the so-called 
King of Quia had not the power 
to make such transfer of their 
country without their consent.</p>

<p>These chiefs have without doubt 
the best side of the argument as 
the stipulations of the treaty were 
agreed to at a public meeting in 
Freetown where Beh Cantah and 
the chiefs with him had no option 
but to sign any article that might 
be put before them. An expedition 
was fitting out at this port 
for the purpose of punishing 
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="45"/>

the chiefs of the Quia country 
who had been guilty of several 
outrages upon quiet Sierra Leone 
traders, Beh-Cantah and a few 
chiefs with him came to town, 
voluntarily to beg their country 
might not be invaded and to 
disavow the illegal acts above 
referred to, advantage was taken 
of their being in town to oblige 
them to sign the treaty, instead 
of the expedition invading their 
territory and there dictating the 
terms of a treaty, and showing 
them there was the power to enforce 
it. As the chiefs in possession 
of the land disputed 
the English right to it, war was 
declared against them, and 
after six weeks hard fighting 
the people were expelled with 
great loss of life and sacrifice 
of great number of their 
towns which were destroyed by 
fire. An other difficulty also 
<catchwords>arises</catchwords>

<pb n="46"/>

arises from the treaty, it is 
that the giving of the land 
to the England stops a much 
frequented slave path of the 
tribes of the coast above 
and below the colony 
in fact it is then only communication 
and being deprived of 
it causes <sic>dissention</sic> and 
quarreling among themselves. 
The war with the Quia country 
has not been at all popular in the colony.</p>

<p>In the early part of November 
last a very large extent 
of country was ceded to this 
colony and is now under its 
jurisdiction; it comprises nearly 
all of the Sherbo Country 
which includes the Sherbro island 
the Turtle islands, Bagru, Mammon Bagre and Bailey 
rivers with their dependencies 
and all lands adjacent to Bendo 
the land ceded in March last.</p>

<p><catchwords>On</catchwords>

<pb n="47"/>

On the 6th of August last, Lagos 
a territory a short distance down 
the coast was ceded to the English 
by Docemo King of Lagos; 
we now hear reports of trouble 
there, as he has become dissatisfied 
with what he then did. 
A few days <unclear>since</unclear> a company 
of soldiers passed down from 
the Gambia.</p>

<p>The French are very desirous 
of acquiring territory on 
this coast and consequently 
look with a jealous eye on 
the late acquisitions to the 
British crown. </p>

<p>The American difficulties 
having excited the fears of the 
cotton consumers in England, they 
are making every effort to be 
less dependent on the United 
States for supply. A company 
has been recently formed in England 
styled the "British and West 
African Cotton Company" with a 
<catchwords>capital</catchwords>

<pb n="48"/>

capital of £100,000 among other 
objects in view, is that of purchasing 
10,000 acres of land in Sierra 
Leone for the purpose of raising 
Cotton by free labor. Cotton of a very 
fair quality grows spontaneously in 
the Sherbro, small lots of which 
has already found its way to the 
English market.</p>

<p>There have been but Eight 
cases of slavers adjudicated in 
the courts of this colony for the 
last year and two only of these 
had slaves on board.</p>

<p>The "Clara Windson" arrived January 
1st with 590 slaves on board 
she had when taken 677, 87 having 
died on the passage to this port.</p>
 
<p>The "Flight" (formerly the "Fairy" 
of New York) arrived May 31st 
with 502 slave on board, she 
had when taken 539, 37 having 
died on the passage. Of the 
slaves arriving here two hundred 
were sent to the Gambia February 
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="49"/>

the 21st, three hundred and 
ninety-five sent to the West 
Indies in the ship "Paterson" 
which sailed November 27th. 
Residents of the colony have taken 
several of the children to bring 
them up as servants, and there 
are yet quite a number left 
in the yard at Kissy; enclosed 
is the form of certificate given 
to them on emigrating.</p>

<p>Among the arrivals of vessels 
to this port the past year were 
50 English, 18 French and 3 Spanish 
men of war, during a residence 
of three years in this port not 
a single American ship of war has 
visited the harbor, it is very desirable 
they should call at times 
as our commerce is quite important 
and should not be left altogether 
without protection, I am frequently 
asked by residents, why, considering 
the importance of our commercial 
intercourse with the 
<catchwords>Colony</catchwords>

<pb n="50"/>

Colony a vessel of the United 
States is never seen in these 
waters?</p>

<p>The petty wars among the 
native chiefs inland of the colony 
the colonial war with the Quia 
people, the American difficulties, 
stopping the supply of American 
goods which are staple 
articles of trade, the fears of 
war between Great Britain and 
the United States, altogether have 
a very depressing effect upon 
business generally.</p>

<p>The colony is in mourning 
for the Prince Consort, no business 
doing, and every-one looking 
anxiously for the news 
by the next Royal mail packet. 
Four English ships of war 
in the harbor.</p>
