<opener>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
of America at Sierra Leone<lb/>
31st December 1861<lb/>

Sierra Leone yearly report</opener>

<p>I have the honor to forward the following report in accordance with the consular instructions as contained in the 153rd and 154th sections of the consular regulations.</p>

<p>The colony of Sierra Leone ceded to the English in the year 1787 by the native <unclear>Temanek</unclear> chiefs embraces an extent of about 500 square miles, its southern point-Cape Shilling lies in about 8 &#176;  10' in latitude and its southern point <unclear>Freelines</unclear> lies in about 8 &#176; 30' M.  it is mostly mountainous land having an elevation of from 2000 to 2500 feet above the level of the sea, it was first settled by a party of free blacks <catchwords>from</catchwords>

<pb facs="37"/>

from Nova Scotia in the year 1792 and their descedents are to this day called settlers, in the Colony.</p> 

<p>The colony is divided into four districts the 1st and 2nd Eastern comprising the vilages of Kessy, Welington, Hastings, Newlands, Allentown, Rokelle, Frasertown, Denham, and Waterloo, the mountain district comprising Wilberforce, Merrytown, Aberdeen Gloucester, Bathurst, Regent and Charlotte, the Banana islands, dependencies of the Colony are also included in this district and included in this district and have the small vilages of Dublin and Ricketts on them, the Western district includes the vilages of Hamilton, York, Goodrich and Heut, each district is under the charge of officer styled manager who is accountable to the colonial government in Freetown the sea-port and capitol of <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="38"/>

colony. </p>

<p>The government of the colony is vested in the Goverbor, and a council of seven members, all of whom hold colonial appointments under the Leone government wit the exception of one, a merchant of the colony, the following are the gentlemen of the council, John Carr Chief Justice, E.H. Beccler, Bishop, A. Fitzjames Queens advocate Geo. W. Nicel Colonial secretary, T Commissing Collector, R. Bradshaw Colonial Surgeon, and Charles Heddle merchant, all of whom are styled favorable, they are only responsible to the home government, and the laws they pass and submitted to the Queen and confirmed by her before the colonists are aware of their entrance, <del>the</del> people of the colony have no voice whatever in their government, neither in the election of <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="39"/>

the members of council above mentioned. </p>

<p>The commerce of the colony has fallen off considerably the past year in consequence of the American difficulties, and a failure of the ground-nut crop.</p>

<p>For a list of the imports and exports of this colony I would refer you to the annual report from this consulate for the year 1860.</p>

<p>The imports from the United States for the present year show a fair average with those of past-years if the general state of commerce is taken into considertion, the colony being to a great extent dependent on the United States for several of the staple articles of its trade our difficulties have naturally interfered with the general facilities of trade, the following table gives a correct idea of the imports for the present year.</p>

<pb facs="42"/>

<p>The excess of importations over exportations is accounted for, by vessels taking <unclear/> and Native gold, which is not reported, an also by the shipment of American goods in the same bottoms to adjacent rivers.</p>

<p>The subjoined table will show the amount of American Tonnage employed in the trade between this colony and the United States. </p>

<p>The ground-nut crop for the past year has been a complete failure, in good seasons this is a very important item in the commerce of the colony and attracts a large amount of French Tonnage for its <catchwords>exportation,</catchwords>

<pb facs="43"/>

exportation, this article finds its best market in France and in consequence of the very heavy differential duties in that country imported on all foreign vessels the carrying is monopolized by French shipping. </p>

<p>There has been considerable of the land about this colony ceded to the English during the past year.</p>

<p>The territory in the Sherbro country known as Bendo was ceded to this colony by Thomas Stephen Caulker, Sherbro chief, and H.M.S.S Falcon, Commander <unclear>Hencags</unclear> took formal possession of it on the 28th of March by hoisting the English flag and firing a royal salute.</p>

<p>Tuesday April 2nd A treaty was concluded, between Governor Hill of this colony and a native chief styling himself <unclear>Beh-Cantah</unclear> King of Quia. By this treaty a <catchwords>portion</catchwords>

<pb facs="44"/>

portion of the Quia country directly inland of the colony, about 16 miles long and 10 miles wide is ceded to the colony, the King of Quia receiving an annual stipend of L 100 as an equivalent</p>

<p>Many of the chiefs of the Quia country and especially those those owning the particular portion of land refuse to acknowledge the treaty as they were not consulted with regard to it and the so-called King of Quia had not the power to make much transfer of their country without their consent.</p>

<p>These chiefs have without doubt the best-side of the argument as the stipulations of the treaty were agreed to at a public meeting in Freetown where Beh cantah and the chiefs with them had no option but to sign any article that might be put before them. An expedition was fitting out at this port for the purpose of punishing <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="45"/>

the, chiefs of the Quia country who had been guiltly of several outrages upon quiet Sierra Leone traders, Beh-Cantah and a few chiefs with him came to town, voluntarily to beg their country might not be invaded and to disavow the illegal acts above referred to, advantage was taken of their being in town to oblige them to sign the treaty, instead of the expedition invading their territory and these dictating the terms of a treaty, and showing them there was the power to enforce it. As the chiefs in possession of the land disputed the English right to it, war was declared against them, and after six weeks hard fighting the people were expelled with great loss of life and sacrifice of great number of their towns which were destroyed by fire. An other difficulty also <catchwords>arises</catchwords>

<pb facs="46"/>

arises from the treaty, it is that the giving of the land to the England stops a much frequented slave path of the tribes of the coast above and below the colony in fact it is then only communication and being deprived of it causes dissention and quarreling among themselves. The war with the Quia country has not been at all popular  in the colony.</p>

<p>In the early part of November last a very large extent of country was ceded to this colony and is now under its jurisdiction, it comprises nearly all of the Sherbo Country which includes the Sherbo island the Turtle islands, Bagre, Mammon Bagre and Bailey rivers with their dependencies and all lands adjacent to Bendo the land ceded in March last.</p>

<p><catchwords>On</catchwords>

<pb facs="47"/>

On the 6th of August last, &#8212; Lagos a territory a short distance down the coast was ceded to the English by Docermo King of Lagos, we now hear reports of trouble there, as he has become dissatisfied with what he then did. A few days since a company of soldiers passed down from the Gambia.</p>

<p>The French are very desirous of aquiring territory on this coast and consquently look with a jealous eye on the late acquistions to the British crown. </p>

<p>The American difficulties having excited the fears of the cotton consumers in England, they are making every effort to be less dependent on the United State for supply. A company has been recently formed in England styled the "British and West African Cotton Company" with a <catchwords>capital</catchwords>

<pb facs="48"/>

 of &#163;100,000 among other objects in view, is that of purchasing 10,000 acres of land in Sierra Leone for the purpose of raising Cotton by free labor. Cotton of a very fair quality grows spontaneously in the Sherbo, small lots of which has already found its way to the English market.</p>

<p>There have been but Eight cases of slavers adjudicated in the courts of this colony for the last year and two only of them had slaves on board, The "Clara Windson" arrived January 1st with 590 slaves on board she had when taken 677, 87 having died on the passage to this port.</p>
 
<p>The "Flight (formerly the "Fairy" of New York) arrived May 31st with 502 slave on board, she had when taken 539, 37 having died on the passage. Of the slaves arriving here five hundred were sent to the Gambia February <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="49"/>

 21st, three hundred and ninety-five sent to the West Indies in the ship "Paterson" which sailed November 27th. Residents of the colony have taken several of the children to bring them up as servants, and there are yet quite a number left in the yard at Rissy, enclosed is the form of certificate given to them on emigrating.</p>

<p>Among the arrvals of vessels to this port the past year were 50 English, 18 French and 3 Spanish men of war, during a residence of three years in this port not a single American ship of war has visited the harbor, it is very desirable they should call at times as our commerce is quite important and should not be left altogether without protection, I am frequently asked by residents, why, considering the importance of our commercial intercourse with the <catchwords>Colony</catchwords>

<pb facs="50"/>

Colony a vessel of the United States is never seen in their waters?</p>

<p>The petty wars among the native chiefs inland of the colony the colonal war with the Quia people, the American difficulties, stopping the supply of American goods which are staple articles of trade, the fears of war between Great Britain and the United States, altogether have a very depressing efefct upon business generally.</p>

<p>The colony is now mourning for the Prince Consort, no business doing, and every-one looking anxiously for the news by the next Royal mail packet Four English ships of war in the harbor.</p>
