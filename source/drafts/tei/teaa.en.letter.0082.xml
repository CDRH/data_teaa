<p>Sir<lb/>
I have the honor to inform the 
Department that on the 4th of September 
the American Ship "Wm Cummings" of 
Philadelphia, George E Miller, master; 
arrived at this port with a cargo of 
coal for the United States Naval Store 
House. On the night previous I had gone 
up the Cuanza River on a business connected
with a line of steamers I have established 
there. The water on the river having fallen 
very much while I was up there I was 
detained four days longer than I expected 
to be absent I arrived at Loanda on 
my return early on the 20th, September, when 
I was informed that the entire crew, twelve 
in number, of the said ship "Wm 
Cumm-<catchwords>ings</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.002"/>
ings" had refused duty and in consequence 
now imprisoned by the Captain; 
the crew preferring to go to jail until
I would return, to lay their grievances before 
me. I heard from different persons 
that the treatment they had received on 
board was horrible in the extreme I 
at once visited them at the prison, when the
representation they made to me excited my 
empathy as well as to prompt me to 
thoroughly examine the case. I commenced 
to do so five days afterwards and the examination 
lasted through ten days.</p>

<p>The circumstances resulting 
from the examination are as follows. It 
seems the crew was shipped at Philadelphia 
on the 8th day of June last 
on the 10th of the same month proceeded 
down river in tow of two tug 
boats. The ship was six days getting 
down the Delaware. During the first 
three days the crew reports that the 
chief oficer, Mr Henry Miller, brother to 
the master, struck and kicked several of 
<catchwords>the</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.003"/>
the crew. The harsh treatment very much 
displeased them and they resolved 
among themselves to refuse duty until 
a promise of better treatment was given 
them. The second officer reported this 
resolution to the mate, who in turn 
reported it to the captain, who went forward. 
The evidence does not show 
that Captain Miller ventured in the 
least to comply with the crew's just 
request; but did by his actions defend 
the mate by locking up the 
twelve seamen in the forecastle for 
thirty-six hours without food or water 
I cannot detect the least sign of 
mutinous conduct, on the part of the 
crew, beyond the simple refusal of 
duty, to receive a promise of better 
treatment in the future; nor can I perceive 
any justifiable motive to oppress 
these unfortunate seamen, whose only 
object evidently was to defend their 
personal safety, during the contemplated 
long voyage before them.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.004"/>
<p>Thirty six hours these men <sic>where</sic> forced 
to suffer from hunger &#38; thirst and according 
to their representation some were 
forced to quench their parched throats 
in a deplorable manner. At the end 
of this period desperation caused them 
to burst open the forecastle door when 
the captain, mates, steward, cook and 
boy all now forward  armed, threatening 
to blow the first man's brains out that 
moved. They implored for water which 
was refused them. Without their making 
any resistance, five of them were put
in irons and the others had their 
hands tied behind them, and some 
again locked up in the forecastle. 
They in irons and tied were distributed 
some to the hatch house- cabin state 
rooms &#38;c. Four or five of them were 
put into close confinement in a 
narrow closet or passage about three (3)
feet long, two and a half (2 1/2) wide and 
seven (7) high. These closets are situated 
in the house on deck at both


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.005"/>
sides inside of which there is a little 
hatch, which when passed and the outside 
door open ventilates the hold.  On 
these occasions the hatch was closed and 
<unclear></unclear> sailor forced in and the outside 
door closed upon him. I went on board 
and examined these places and found 
them just as they had been represented 
to me: places without the least 
ventilation. Some of the crew were 
kept in these places of confinement from 
one to four hours, although the testimony 
varies as to the length of time. The 
sufferings of these poor creaturee must have 
been terrible as when taken out of 
these places of confinement they would 
fall down from exhaustion. Their inhuman
persecutors even gagged one 
while confined and another was dragged 
out of his berth with a lame 
shoulder and arm, and in this state 
his arms were forced behind him and 
tied.  His groans and cries did not 
move the pity of his persecutors for an 
<catchwords>hour</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.006"/>
hour and a half. Hunger, thirst, sweat boxes
and threats forced them all to 
submit even to the humiliation of begging 
the Captain's pardon.</p>

<p>The Department will please 
observe that all these cruelties were inflicted 
within a few hours sail of 
Philadelphia and in sight of the Revenue
Cutter, which the Captain refused to 
call along side even at the joint request 
of the men. The Captain pretends 
he did not know the Revenue Cutter was 
in the vicinity, but you will observe 
by several depositions that she nevertheless 
was.</p>

<p>Captain Miller tries to represent 
that his crew mutinied but, I cannot 
see the least sign of anything 
of the sort... It was a joint refusal of 
duty, with the object to get a simple 
promise of being better treated in the 
future. The evidence of the manner in 
which the seamen were used previous 
to refusing duty, is not very clear be-
<catchwords>yond </catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.007"/>
yond their own complaints, but I have
a right to suppose that it was very severe 
from the brutal manner they were subsequently 
abused and on this supposition I 
think the men had a right, if not justified, 
in making a request which ought 
to have been complied with instead of 
torturing them into submission. Captain 
Miller fails to explain to me, why he 
did not return to Philadelphia&#8212; to return 
his men would have been glad to weigh 
anchor&#8212; and his refusal to seek assistance 
from the Revenue Cutter, proves his preference 
to his own way of settling such 
difficulties.</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose 
seventeen depositions properly authenticated <note>Enclosure Nos. <unclear/></note>
by me. The department is reading over 
some of these will feel equally as indignant 
as I did when taking the 
depositions.  The brutality of the mate 
was more excessive than the Captain, 
although the latter has several very serious  
charges against him. Several of the 
<catchwords>crew</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.008"/>
crew had their heads broken by iron 
or wooden belaying pins another with a 
hatchet, another wounded severely in the 
face, from a kick from the mate, while 
at work on the ship's side, another 
tossed overboard for 15 minutes for losing 
a scraper another severely beaten 
with a piece of wood for the slight 
offence of contradiction, others severely 
kicked in the side while at the 
wheel and other horrible brutalities 
all stated in the enclosed depositions.</p>

<p>Notwithstandiing the denial 
of the mate I am convinced of the 
truth of crew's complaint, that nearly 
the entire passage they only received 
one bucket of water per day for the use 
of twelve men, besides their tea &#38; coffee 
and meals, which of itself was a torture 
particularly as the vessel neared 
this coast and also there appears no 
cause to have justified them in 
giving this short allowance of water 
as there was plenty of water in the 


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.009"/>
ship's tanks and much rain was caught 
during passage.</p>

<p>Captain Miller professes not 
to have known anything about the brutal
manner in which the mate treated the crew
The crew on their arrival here were so perfectly
horrified that they were willing to suffer
anything in preference to returning to the
ship. Humanity as well as my consular
duty prompted me at once to discharge
the entire crew of twelve men and
to demand of Captain Miller three months
extra pay to each man. I accordingly
addressed him a note to that effect on <note>Enclosure No 18</note>
the 7th ultimo to which I have received
no written reply. He called at my office
and intimated to me that he was not
prepared to comply with my request.</p>

<p>The ship's destination was from here
to Bahia in search of a freight. On the
12th ultimo Captain Miller gave notice at
the Custom House to have his ship cleared 
for Philadelphia as he wish to sail 
on the 20th of the same month. I received 
<catchwords>this</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.010"/>
this information on the 14th ultimo, and 
the same day Captain Miller told me that 
he intended to go to sea under protest.
I therefore lost no time in sending the 
<note>Enclosure No 19</note> Governor General the enclosed despatch in 
accordance with authority derived from the 
closing clause of the 28th section of the 
act of Congress approved August 18th 
1856.</p>

<p>Captain Miller complains that I 
have disabled his ship with my decision 
as he cannot proceed for want of a crew 
I told him that the responsibility was his 
not mine, for if he had respected the 
laws of his country and humanity he 
would not have placed his ship in difficulty.
He has hinted to me several times 
the certainty of judicial proceedings being 
taken against me when the ship arrives home; 
with a view to intimadate me, I nevertheless 
persist in the performance of my duty 
as I consider it absolutely necessary that 
these unfortunate seamen should be 
protected from further inhumanity more 
especially

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.011"/>
especially now as since what has occurred 
it is reasonable to suppose that a greater 
spite would he held against them, rather 
than expect more moderate treatment.</p>

<p>The chief motive which caused 
me to discharge the entire twelve men, was 
the manner they all were treated when 
they combined to ask of the Captain a 
promise of better treatment. Captain Miller 
in his defence pretends to make out a 
case of mutiny to justify his proceedings 
notwithstanding it is clearly proved that 
at the time the crew made no resistance.
The depositions of the Captain and the Mate, 
taken last, assert that the men drew 
their knives, but from subsequent communication 
with the men I learn, they did draw 
their knives, one by one, and deliver them to 
the Captain, who broke the blade of each 
knife and returned the part with the 
handle. The deposition of the Captain 
and mate particularly the former have been 
consider by me with due caution and from 
whatever weak point they may wish to 
fab-
<catchwords>ricate</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.012"/>
ricate a different version to the case. The 
case in general as it appears to me is 
one of a serious nature and entitled to 
special attention that a check may be put 
on inhuman ship matters who trusting to 
the aversion consuls generally have to assume 
grave responsibilities and thus escape 
without even a reprimand for their 
brutality and inhumanity to seamen.</p>

<p>I deemed it proper to have 
the wounds of the crew examined before the 
Chief medical officer of this city who sent 
me a certificate of an authenticated translation 
<note>Enclosure No. 20</note> of which I have the honor to enclose 
I also have the honor to enclose an extract 
<note>Enclosure No. 21</note> from the ship's log book which 
contains an observation made with different 
Ink indicating its having been written 
at this port.</p>

<p>Captain Miller about a month 
ago represented to me verbally that he 
had no money to meet my demands, and 
if he had he should not pay it as 
such payment would deprive him of the 


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.013"/>
privilege of proceeding against the crew for 
mutiny. I reminded him that he would 
be obliged to pay or otherwise I should 
detain his ship. I pointed out and 
read to him several consular regulations 
and advised him to comply at 
once and proceed on his voyage to 
Babia for which port I could assist 
him to get a few men sufficient to 
navigate his vessel by asking them from 
a Portuguese Corvette stationed at this province. 
Captain Miller made a proposition which I at once refused to entertain, 
that he should appoint his second mate 
master, he and the mate go as passengers 
and me to return the crew-on board. For 
three weeks or more Captain Miller never 
again mentioned the subject or made any 
allusion to what he intended to do, notwithstanding
he frequently visited my office.</p>

<p>On the 13th inst. the British 
Bark "Ionic" under the Command of Wm 
E Woodbury, native of Gloucester, Mass;
and Charles H. Powers of Salem, Mass; as 
mate


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.014"/>
mate arrived here enroute for Boston  
from which post said vessel had 
originally sailed on this voyage.</p>

<p>On the 14th inst. I met Capts.
Woodbury and Miller under the Custom 
House shed, Captain Millers' case was 
again <sic>brough</sic> up when he suggested 
that if I would send the man on board 
he would appoint Mr Charles H Powers  
mate of the "Ionic", as master of the 
Ship "Wm Cummings". and his mate 
Mr Henry Miller go mat&#233; in the 
"Ionic" while he would go passenger 
in the ship. I thought the matter 
over and concluded to approve of the 
proposition in defence of the interest of 
said ship's <unclear>crews</unclear>. During the afternoon
I met Mr Powers on shore who expressed 
to me in the presence of my 
brother and Bookkeeper Mr. Beaton that 
he would like the chance very much to 
take the ship home. I made known my 
approval to Captain Miiller Woodbury 
the consented to make the exchange 
<catchwords>of</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.015"/>
of mates. The consent of Mr Powers was then  
said to be required and it was not until 
the afternoon of the 16th received a 
note from Mr Powers saying that he had thought 
the matter over and concluded to remain by 
the "Ionic". </p>

<p>The sudden revulsion of consent 
leads me to suppose that my willingness to 
accede to his own proposition did not afterwards 
appear so convenient. It would have 
been more gratifying to me to have this case 
brought up for trial at home than have 
Captain Miller publicly defy the Consular  
regulations of the United States by refusing 
to comply with my demands. In vain have I 
told him that if I acted contrary to his 
view of the case he could pay the amount 
I demanded under protest. He refuses every 
advice and thus the ship remains in 
port to the disadvantage of her owners in 
whose interest I have been unsuccessful 
with my advice.</p>

<p>Captain Miller publicly declares 
that he will wait here until the 
<catchwords>arrival</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.016"/>
arrival of an United States Vessel-of-War. 
I have been unsuccessful in convincing him 
that the presence of such a vessel would not
avail him further than provide him with 
a crew as he will not be permitted to 
leave this port until he has settled with 
this Commercial Agency.</p>

<p>The twelve men have been provided 
with a boarding house on shore, and I 
am anxious for their sake to have this 
question settled that I may send them 
away as this is the commencement of our 
sickly season, whenever this takes place 
they will be sent if necessary <sic>to to</sic> the 
United States.</p>

<p>Under this date I address 
<note>Enclosure No. 22</note>an official letter to Captain Miller, a 
copy of which I enclose for the information 
of the Department.</p>

<p>Captain Miller has also intimated 
to me that he will remain here 
if necessary until he receives orders from 
Philadelphia before he will comply with 
my demands. I reminded him that the 
<catchwords>responsibility</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.017"/>
responsibility of such step would rest 
on him individually, and expressed my 
regret that his owners should be made 
to suffer from his own imprudence.</p>

<p>In closing this despatch 
I wish to assure the Department of my 
confidence of having performed my duty 
in accordance with the trust confided 
in me as a consular officer of the United 
States. I have been guided by the 
consular instructions in all my resolutions 
and I anticipate the approval of the 
Department and its support should 
I be prosecuted.</p>

sundry others about the hand owing
to blows with some blunt instrument
and ecchymois of the right leg, the
consequences of bruises accompanied
with difficulty, of moving readily the
left hand in consequence of the inflammation of the joints <del/>  of the finger

age 47 years, he showed various
scars about the head, at result of
strong and heavy blows by some

<p>The following named men of the crew
of the ship Wm Cummings having
been presented to me by Augustus 
Archer Silva, Commericial Agent of 
the United States, viz. Henry Beckwith
James Calden John Little Edward 
Perez, Andrew Hewright and
Bernard White in order that I might 
examine several wounds alleged to have
been recieved during a voyage from
Philadelphia to this port. I testify 
that having examined Henry Beckwith
I discerned sudry scars, over
the right parietal lobe which by
their colour, seemed to be recent and 
due to wounds made by contusing
instruments, and there is also a 
hypertropy of the nasal region
which seemed due to a heavy blow
and which is not yet cured.</p>

<p>On examining James Calden
aged 22 years, there was found a 
scar over the left eye brow of
<catchwords>about</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.023"/>
about an inch in size and several
others, upon the head due to wounds
made by crushing weapons and
fuller ecchymosis in the right leg
the result of contusion and he also
experiences some difficulty with the
use of the right hand from having 
suffered inflammmation in the finger
joints</p>

<p>On examining John Little aged
47years there werer found sundry
scars upon the head, resulting from
deep and large wounds made by
a crushing instrument and near
the left parietal lobe one wound
just healing, sundry ecchymosis
on the right leg and signs of a 
contusion on the left side in the
lumbar parts. He complains more
over of giddines of the head.</p>

<p>Edward Perez aged 31 years who 
says he is a native of <unclear>Corcuma</unclear>
showed several scars near the
left front parietal lobe on the
right side of the neck and 
<catchwords>cheek</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.024"/>
cheek bone and on the joints of the
fourth finger of the left hand all
of which seem to be the result of
wounds made with a <unclear>sharpened</unclear>
instrument, there are also signs of 
contusion on the left shoulder</p>

<p>Andrew Henwright aged 19 years
showed a scar on the left eyebrow
and another on the right parietal
lobe, both <unclear/> but recent</p>

<p>Bernard White shows signs on
the left hand of having been
bound with rope and contusions on
the left side near the spleen.</p>

<p>All these men declare that
the scars and contusions were made
on board the ship, within the last
two months, with wooden and iron
instruments, and this appears to 
me to be the truth because the
greater part of the scars, I have
examined indicate the same <sic>becides</sic>
thier not having been fitly and property
treated.</p>

<p>Sir<lb/>
Captain C H Robbins of the
American Brig "M Shepard" has told
me that he offered you to exchange
his mate with yours that you might
take advantge of the opportunity
to get your ship home to her owner.
Two days having elapsed since that
proposition was made with any decisions
 on your part and as the
"M Shepard" will sail in a couple
of days for St Helena. I address
you this letter to suggest the 
propriety of your accepting this
offer on behalf of the interest
of your owner who must be at 
a heavy loss by the detentions of 
their ship at this port.
<catchwords>Captain</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.027"/>
Captain Robbins mentioned that
one of your reasons which checked
your decisions was your objection to 
pay the expenses incurred by the
crew since they have been on shore.
In consideration of the uncertainty
of when another opportunity may
offer to get the ship home and
for the interest of your owners I
will yield to your determination not
to pay, and refer the amount to the
United States Government for Collection
on the arrivial of the ship home.</p>

<p>Should you thus wish to make
me the same proposition in respect
to Mr Beaty  as you did with Mr. 
Powers mate of the Bark "Ionic" I
will send your former crew on board
of the Wm Cumming or otherwise
I will send them away by the first
opportunity offering.</p>

<p> You are perfectly aware that a recent Royal Decree
of Portugal prohibts the shipment <catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.028"/>
of Portugese sailors onboard of
foreign vessels, unless provided
with a certificate of exemption 
from military service and as
those certificates can only be
obtained at Lisbon this circumstance
will prevent your
getting a crew when you
feel disposed to proceed on your voyage.</p>

<p>Whatever difference of
opinion you may have reguarding
my official action will
be better decided with the
crew at home than otherwise.</p>

<p>Sir<lb/>
Your letter dated 11th January 1868
recieved this 10 am, and in which you 
say Capt Robbins offered to exhange his 
mate for mine if I understand the matter
right, <unclear>isnt</unclear> correct and it is strange that 
you who detained this ship here would
at this time refer this matter for my 
consideration, when you know the Brig
"M Sheppard" arrived here on the 27th
Dec 1864, and at this date Jany 12th
1868, is actually cleared from the 
custom house. If you had ever given
me in your correspondence any reason
to support that I would be allowed
any alternative, but to comply with
your demands I would have been
very happy to make any sacrifice
to enable this ship to leave this port
<gap/> 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.030"/>
this ship now how do I know that his
orders to the Captain of the Port, the
Customshouse, the forts, and the ship of
war at his command have been
rescinded how do I know that Mr Beaty
is competent to navigate the ship in case
of my sickness or death, which may
occur from the debilitating effects of
this climate, you are aware that 
<unclear>halfway</unclear> <unclear/> crew, as you call them
are at this time sick in hopspital or
boardinghouse and not able to do duty.
Now sir I thank you for the interest
you take in the owners whose property
you detain here perishing under a hot
sun for four months because you consider
the criminal charges brought against
my mate and Iproved, I am
not aware that trial by Jury is abolished
in the United States yet, except in 
time of war. You say you will send
my crew away. <unclear>Mind</unclear> I say they owe
<gap/>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.031"/>
I offered another Master, Mr <unclear>Polaur</unclear>
you refused three times. Now after
four earnest attempts on my part
to get the ship away, feeling in consequence
of your determination to detain 
her and I must say not that
justice might be done, but that your
might show your <unclear/> you dont
suppose that I as Master of this
ship would wish quietly to submit
to any more insults in my efforts
to get this ship away from here
which as a man I could not submit
to for one moment. I must say
that your consideration for my former
crew has not in my opinion improved
either their health of their morals
but as mannfacturers of evidence no
doubt the can't be beat nevertheless
when you show me the Governor
has given official orders to allow
the ship to go. I will join you in 
every honest attempt to get the 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.032"/>
States Government and laws, seek damages
from you for detention of the
ship. You say I object to pay the expenses
incurred by the crew, while on
shore, pray, why not, did I authorize
you or any body in Loanda to feed
them or supply them with clothes
which you did to prevent them
coming on board the ship, where they
had clothes, and which you told the
men, you demanded from me and I 
would not give them up, but which
was not the fact. Men who have
been pampered as they have been are
little good to any ship and I don't
think they will ever pay you the
interest of the money, you have 
spent on them.</p>

<p>Sir<lb/>
Your letter of yesterday has been received.</p>

<p>I regret that you should
have so interpreted the sense
in which I addressed you to cause
you to reply in the manner which
you have which prompts me to address you again.</p>

<p>My letter to you of
the 11th was written to prove to the
Department of State that I have
done everything in my power to
futher the interest of the ship
"Wm Cummings".</p>

<p>With reference to the 
M Shepard going away I have to
inform you that if I delayed writing 
<catchwords>you</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.034"/>
you on this subject was because
Captains Robbins told me that
he had discussed the subject with
you, and that you favored the idea
objecting only to pay the expenses the
crew had encurred on shore, and
that this objection should not deprive
the owners of the ship "Wm
Cummings" at Philadelphia I
adressed you as I did, that
you might take advantage of the
chance opportunity to get their
ship home, and to have the 
circumstances recorded in writing
in case of your refutal.</p>

<p>It is true  I refused to 
allow M Polson, your second mate,
to go home master of the Wm
Cummings" with yourself and
mate on board as passengers, but
I did not finally refuse to allow
him (Mr Polson) to go as master,
taking the mate out of the vessel
<gap/> the crew were willing

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.035"/>
to go. You never asked them in a 
body, but if you had, they would
not have gone as the subsequently
told me they objected to do so. Your
third attempt to get the ship home
with my approval was with M
Powers, mate of the "Ionic", to go
as master, who after consenting, 
unexpectedly refused to go. These are 
your earnest attempts to get the 
ship home to which you refer,  failing
as you say in consequence of
my determination to detain her not
that justice might be done but to 
show my powers, - and you appeal
to me to know if, you as master of
that ship would wish quietly to
submit to any more insults in your
endeavor to get the ship home.</p>

<p>This language I consider
rather strong and quite unwarrantable.
I prevented your going
<gap/>Act of Congress until you
<gap/>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.036"/>
Commercial Agency. My motives for doing
so were based upon depositions taken
from your crew and confirmed by your
second mate, steward, cook and boy
charging you and your chief officer
with having cruelly and brutally treated
said crew from the time the ship left
Philadelphia until her arrival in this port.
There are six charges against
you and your mate of a criminal nature
besides other serious ones including
that of kepping the crew on a
suffering short allowance of water of
two gallons for twelve men per day. The
mutiny as you allegd was revoked by
the brutality of your mate into which
you did not investigate but proceeded
to force to submission by acts similar
to those of the Ancient inquisition,
while within reach of the United
State Authorities</p>

<p>These are the charges
against your ship which justify no
<gap/> of the

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.037"/>
crew and three months extra wages
which you have seen fit to contend against.
The Consular Regulations of
the United States demands me to proceed
as I have done and to hold
your papers until you have settled
the amount I have demanded from
you for extra wages.</p>

<p>I always thought that
when an opportunity offered like the
one of the mate of the Big "M Shepard"
you would gladly embrace the opportunity
to defend your argument in
the halls of justice of the United
States, but it seems you have
managed to avoid with what I
consider weak excuses to take
advantage of the only opportunity
offering to get your ship home to
her owners and to face the case before
the Tribunal of Country where
will be seen if you have been justly
<gap/>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.038"/>
ing these men against further suffering
on board your ship.</p>

<p>Captain Robbins told me
that Mr. Beaty is a capable seaman
and navegator -- so what further evidence
do you want of his qualifications
and, again should you
accept Mr. Beaty or any one else to
command your vessel I will release
her from the vigilance of the Portuguese
Authoriteis which I supposed
you would have considered an
understood fact when I proposed
to send the crew on board under 
his command.</p>

<p>Eight of the crew are
in as good health as when they landed
and three of them are now recovering
from a slight attack of fever which
you know does not inspire the constitution
of anyone: a few days out 
at sea would make them as strong
as ever.</p>

<p><gap/>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.039"/>
crew on shore I shall report to
the Department of State.</p>

<p>I never told the men
that I demanded their cloths
from you. I have never demanded
them because a refusal would
have caused me to take them
by force a spectacle I would
always wish to avoid in a 
foreign port. I thought it
would be time enough to do 
so when the men were to leave
this port.</p>

<p>You have misunderstood
my motives in this
as well as in every other advance
I have made for the 
interest of your owners, and
that you may not longer be
deluded I most respectfully
tell you that unless the 
Government of the United States
advises me to deliver you your
papers I shall not do so

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.040"/>
until the demands of this Commerical
Agency have been complied with.</p>

<p>I do not expect to have
a reply to my Despatch per Bark
"Ionic" before April 5th. The depositions
which went by her, are
those which constitute my official
action and I fear their nature
will not afford you much relief.</p>

<p>Every day complicates
your case more and more with
this Commerical Agency, and I,
even now, after what you wrote me
on the 12th inst: think it would
be best for you to take my advice
of the 11th inst: as it will not
take two hours to exchange mates.</p>

<p>Sir,<lb/>
Your letter of the 14th inst received
and in which you say you derive your
authority to detain the ship from the
26th and 28th, sections of the Act of Congress
approved August 18th, 1856. Will you
be kind enough to show me in what
manner they bear directly on this call
to I undertand the law, I am individually
responsible for acts of cruelty
proved to have been committed by me
or with my consent. You have held
an examination with closed doors
like an inquistion, and have not
shown me how the charges against
me were proved. Why sir, my life might
have been <unclear/>  away for what I know
and I have not been allowed to prove
the statements made against me, to 
be falsehoods, and exaggerations which
I contend they are, and and if they 
were proved even, you cannot by law 
<catchwords>detain</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.045"/>
detain this ship in the manner in
which you have done, as a principal
is not responsible for such acts of an
Agent, you also to further your own
ends in this case justify my crew in
their revolt in the Delware and tell
me what my duty was, in this case
you mistake when you think you are
the proper person to tell me what
my duty is in case of revolt or munity
and until the laws of the United States
decide that I was wrong, I will hold
that I was right. Where did you get
the authority to call on foreign Governors
and their forces to detain an American
ship until the master replies with
demands of yours, against which he
protests. I dont know but would give
much to know. I have not got the 
means to comply with your demands
and if I had, I would not because
they are unlawful, and you will please

mariner on board the American Ship
"Wm Cummings" of Philadelphia
and after being by me duly sworn
deposes and says as follows.
</p>

<p>
That I was born in Islesbro 
Maine, opposite Belfast, am 19 years
of age and reside at Islesbro, Maine
opposite Belfast, and on the 8th of
June shipped in the Ship Wm Cummings
and on the 10th embarked and
proceeded down river in tow of a
steam tug for about 6.5 miles. Where
we anchored for the night, and made
sail next morning and went down a
piece further. The captain and mate
ill treating the crew. In consequence
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.052"/>
of which we refused duty and requested
the captain to call alongside the Reverend
<unclear>Cutter</unclear> which he refused to do. He forced
us into the forecastle and kept us there
48 hours with neither food nor water
refusing us even prison fare. My thirst
was so intense that I was foeced to
drink my own water which gave temporary
relief. At last we burst open
the forecastle door, whereupon the captain
put us in irons and lashed us to the
bits aft. We left the Delaware about
the 16th June and proceeded on our voyage
the captain and mate severely ill-
treating seceral of the crew. About a month
out the Captain struck me heavy blows
on my sides with his boots, by swinging
himself from the eave of the wheel house
directly on me, with threats of scattering my
brains if I did not mind myself. On
another occasion the mate accused me
of striking the bell out of time when at
the wheel and in consequence gave me
several severe kicks. On the 26th of July
<catchwords>when</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.053"/>
when coming out of the forecastle to brace
up the fore yard, the mate caught me
by the throat and afterwards let go to
let me brace up the yard but on
return the mate came up behind me
and struck me severe blows on the
head with an iron belaying <unclear/> inflicting
wounds on my head and over
my left eye, marks of which you can see yet.
With the blood running down
my face the mate ordered me up to
slush down the foretop gallant mast.
During the passage, I was occupied
with others scraping the ship's side;
I was working with an old scraper which
parted in two pieces, one of the pieces
falling over board. To punish me for
the loss of the scraper the mate
tied a rope round me and lowered
me into the water up to the neck.
The ship was rolling heavily at the
time and would completely submerge
me and then bring me violently against
her side with the opposite
<catchwords>roll</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.054"/>
roll. I was kept in that position for
fifteen minutes. I had been previous
to that punishment for six hours scraping
the ship's side in a bowline, I
was quite exhausted and sick from
this cruel treatment.</p>

<p>
We only had two gallons
of water given for the entire crew
per day' We had also one pot of tea
in the morning and another at night.</p>

<p>On arrival here we refused duty
wanting to see the consul, but learned
he was absent. We preferred to go to
jail and await his return in preference
to turning to.

twenty third day of September, AD

now being by me duly sworn deposes

<p>That I was born in New York
and am 23 years of age. I am seaman
by profession and reside at Caroline
Street. No. 5 New York. I shipped
at Philadelphia on the 8th day of
June of this year on board the 
American Ship Wm Cummings of
said port and on the 10th went on
board and proceeded down the
river in tow of a tug boat, who
left us about 60 or 65 miles down
where we anchored. We furled out
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.057"/>

and while clearing up the forward
sails, the mate without any provocation
or reason took a hands pike
and knocked some of the men down
and kicked them with heavy boots
threatening to knock their brains
out. I was standing on the poop
abuff the main mast, cleaning
up the mizzen sails and witnessed
the above statement. After supper
all hands were called forward
to get the Harboard anchor ready
to let go if needed. THe mate
helf in his hand an iron belaying
pipe, threatening to knock my
brains out because I did not pay
the chain quick enough over the
windlass. Next morning the 11th
we got under weigh again and
proceeded a short distance when
we came to and in doing so the
mate again repeated his harsh
treatment by knocking down some
of the crew with hand spikes and
belaying pins. We came to the
<catchwords>conclusion</catchwords>

conclusion that night amongst
ourselves that we would not
work any more, on account of such
cruel tratment, whereupon the
next morning at 4 am the second
mate came and ordered us to turn
to which we refused to do unless
we got a satisfactory promise
that we would be better treated. The
captain came forward and asked us
the reason why we did not turn to,
one of us told him that the continually
knock us down with handspikes
and irons belaying pins. The
speaker was told to sit down, and
be quiet about it, or, otherwise he
(the Captain) would shoot him with
a Revolver. We were then in the
forecastle and the Captain locked
us in, saying he would give us
nothing to eat or drink until we
turned to. We remained there 48
hours without food or water. Our
thirst was so intense that we were forced
to drink our own water

only temporary relief. We asked
for water and bread, which was
refused us. We then broke open
the forecastle door and begged
again for water, which was refused us not even allowing
us to draw a bucket of salt
water. The captain with revolver
in hand and hatchet in other the
mate second mate and boy had
each an axe, and threatened that if we would move, they would
knock our brains out. Three of
the men were put in irons and
said they could manage the rest
and loaded the remaining men
in the forecastle again. About
15 minutes aftrwards, Captain
and mate came forward, and opened
the forecastle door, and told us
to come out on deck. One of
the men (Edward Perez) was sick
in his berth, and could not go
on deck so the Captain and
second mate hauled him out of
<catchwords>his</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.060"/>
his berth in a rough manner
and tied his hands behind his
back and put him into the
mizzen hatch house and kept
him there four hours, during which
time his sufferings almost made
him mad screaming with the
most intense agony all the time
The Captain in the meantime
tied my hands behind my back
also and put me into the
mizzen hatch house. Neither Edward
Perez or myself gave the
least cause for this treatment. I
had been in the mizzen hatch
house about ten minutes, I was
taken out, and put into a sweat box,
and kept there about an
hour. I was <unclear/> and tired
and would have fainted, if I
had not been released, as it was
I fell helpless on the deck from
exhaustion and it was ten minutes
before I came to. The sweat

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.061"/>
completely closed up and terrible
even now for me to think about
after I came to, I was put in the
mizzen hatch house again and
kept in there about three hours when
I was put in the washing room in
the cabin with another man, where
we remained till 4 am next
morning when I was put in the
main hatch house and the other
man was put into the sweat
box for four or five hours, during
which the man suffered terribly
from want of air, at whose cries
the captain threatened that if he
wouldn't make his worse, he would
blow his brains out. The mate was
ordered by the Captain to put a gag
in the mans mouth which <unclear/>

cabin. The following morning we were
all forced to turn to, except two who
were still in irons. We got under
weigh, and proceeded some distance
down the river, and anchored for the
night, and after supper, I with three
others were put in irons again and
confined in the lazarette, until the next
morning, when we were released to wash
decks down. We again weighed anchor
after breakfast and proceeded to work
down river, when the Captain released
the first two men put in irons
We came to again at night and as
before six of us were put in irons
and next day (16th June) set at liberty
again, when we made all sail discharged
the pilot and put to sea
During the whole passage we were treated
with great cruelty. The mate one day
as I was coming from the wheel said
You are the ___ ___ ___ who cant steer
and saying that he kicked me violently
four or five times, and struck
me in the face three times. This
<catchwords>happened</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.063"/>
happened about a week after
we left the breakwaters when
about a month out while putting
a strop on the starboard fore
brace, the mate told me I was
doing my work wrong. I told him
it was the way I had been taught
when he took hold of the end
of the starboard fore brace and

leaving black and blue marks
all over my body for over a month,

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.064"/>
along with the second mate, and
the boy. The captain told me to go
on the portside to get a few small
chains to put them forward out of
the way. I did as I was ordered and
then shifted some wood and then
repeated both jobs due to the Captain
who when going forward to inspect
the work perceived some pieces of
wood on the top of one of the beef
barrels, he asked me why I did not
reuse that wood also. I replied that
I was not told to do so. He said I
told a falsehood, which I refuted
whereupon he took hold of a piece
of a broken handspike and beat
me for several minutes, until I
cried out "murder" when he came
to beat me. From exhaustion I
fell back, and the Captain who
was still on deck on returning found
me prostrated he again seized the
piece of handspike and beat me
severely again, and forced me on deck
to work with my hand and <unclear/>

greatly swollen I was ordered on
another <unclear/> to scrape the paint
over the ships side on a stage one

longer than the other. When the mate
saw this, he jumped over the side
and kicked me severly in the face
several times, cutting a gash over
the left eye. The scar of which
you can see, and afterwards refused
to allow me to trat the wounds
he had inflicted on another occasion
he struck me on the porehead
with a marline spike and cut a

pulling at the mainbeace the mate
approached me from the rear, and
dealt me a severe blow on the back
of the head, which threw me on down
senseless.</p>

<p>Two days after we arrived here
we wished to see the Consul

board, to whom we represented that
we had been cruelly treated, who
advised us to wait your return
but we would not turn to and
preferred to wait until your return

Before me Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent of the United
States of America at St Paul de Loanda
personally appeared Charles
Smith mariner on board of the
American ship Wm Cummings
of Philadelphia and after
being by me duly sworn deposed
and says as follows.
</p>

<p>That I was born in Germany
and went to the United States for
the first time in 1859 and since
that period I have been employed
in America Wessels and during
the war served on board 3 different
US Vessels of war. I am
26 years of age and reside at No
90 Broome St New York City I
shipped on board the Wm Cummings
of Philadelphia on the 8th of June
last, and reported for duty two
days aftterwards. On the same
<catchwords>day</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.069"/>
day at 7 am, the ship proceeded
down the river in tow of a steam
tug. Sixty five miles, and during
the passage down, made sail on the
ship during three days ending June
12th. When all hands knocked off
work, on account of ill usage and
the cruelty of both master and
mate, who without cause struck
severe blows at three of the crew
After which the master and
mate fastened all the crew in
the forecastle, and kept us 48
hours without food or water.
We in the meantime suffered
intensely from thirst, obliging
us to drink our own water.
Several times during our confinement
we requested to see the Captain,
to ask him to give us at
least solitary prison fare, which
he regused. We requested him to
call alongside the Revenue Cutter
which he also refused to ndo
notwithstanding the cutter was
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.070"/>
in sight, as subsequently reported
to us. Hunger and thirst obliged us
to force open the forecastle door, when
the captain arrived with a Revolver
and harchet in hand, and the mate
with an axe. The second mate, Cook
Steward, and boy were also armed
with crew belaying pins, I was the
first to come out of the forecastle
followed by the others, and making
no resistance, the Captain levelled
a pistol at my head, and drove the
rest back into the forcastle. When
the mate seived hold of me, and took
me into the Cabin, and put me into
single irons, besides abusing me with
scandalous languages, shaking in my
face an axe, and using threats that
he would knock my brains out, He
(the Mate) afterwards confined mein
a narrow stateroom with another man
in two sweat boxes and kept us there
two hours the first day, and two hours
the second with only three quarts of
<catchwords>a</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.071"/>
a pot of water, and one biscuit
per day. Myself and four others were
kept in irons three days. Three of
whom were only confined at night
While the rest of the crew were forced
to turn to, who made sail on the
ship and proceeded down the
river.
</p>

<p>
On the16th the pilot was discharged
previous to which I was
taken out of irons. During the
passage the Captain &amp; mate
abused the crew with unusual
cruelty, inflicting on several
severe contusions from the effects
of heavy blows with belaying
pins. The Captain one day struck
one of the men with a hatchet
inflicting severe wounds. He
(the Captain) also struck several
of the crew on different occasions
at the wheel, his favorite method
of doing so, was to brace himself
up with his hands on the upper
part of the wheelhouse, and
<catchwords>threw</catchwords> 

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.072"/>
<fw>12</fw>
threw his feet with full force
against the side of the man
below the ribs, and one of the
men still suggers from this
harsh treatment. The Captain
and mate saught every occasion
to influct barbarous punishment
upon us and thus we
suggered the enture passage of
about 80 days. From the day
the pilot left us, up to the day
we arrived at this port, we had
given to us only two gallons of
water for the use of twelve men
for twenty four hours, causing
us great suffering. When we reached
the wanter latitudes, notwithstanding
plenty of rain water was caught
no greater allowance was given
During the passage one of the crew
Andrew Henwright which scraping
the barnacles of the ships side
broke in two parts, the scraper, one
of the part falling overboard. The
mate in presence of the Captain

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.073"/>
to inflict punishment on Andrew
Henwright for the loss of the <unclear/>
tied round him a rope (a bowline)
and lowered him into the water
The velocity was then three knots
and the ship was rolling considerably
and at every roll the
poor seaman would strike the
side of the vessel violently and
on the return roll would be completely
submerged under water
he was kept in this punishment
for over half and hour, besides
having previously worked over the
ships side half a day, when taken
up he was very exhausted and
was ten minutes in coming to
and durint the night was delirious
and vomiting salt water. The same
man had been punished very
severely with an iron belaying
pin on a previous occasion --
breaking his hand in several
places. The <unclear/> of which are
yet quite visible.</p>

<p><catchwords>Two</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.074"/>
Two days after arrival at this
port, in consequence of severe threats
we refused duty, and demanded to
see the Consul, and as you were
from here we refused to return to
duty until we laid our grievances
before you and preferred to be put
in jail by the Captain rather
than return to our work.

personally appeared John H. Davis
mariner on board the American Ship

American ship "Wm Cummings" and
on the 10th proceeded down river in tow
of a steam tug for about 60 or 65 miles and then anchored. We worked
down river two or three days comming

the rigging. He also struck several with
his fist and <unclear>capstan</unclear> bar and kicked
them frequently, especually when
closing up sails. On account of
this cruel treatment we knowed off
duty. When the captain and mate came
forward, the former with revolver in
hand, and ordered us to return to
futy which we refused to do unless
better treatment was promised us,
or for him to call alongside the
Revenue Cutter (the pilot was still
on board) which he refused to do,
and shut us up in the forecastle
where we were kept 48 hours with neither
food nor water, refusing o give us
a drop even when our thirst was
intense. Some of the men including
myself drunk their own water. At
last we burse the forcastle door
open, when Captain, mate, and boy
came forward armed, with revolver
axes and belaying pins to keep us
back. We asked for water, even to

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.078"/>
be allowed to draw a bucket of salt
water, which was refused, replying to
our entreaties with threats to knock our
brains out. They put most of the
men in irons and some of them in
the sweat box, which is a terrible place
without the least ventilation.</p>

<p>
They inflicted cruel punishment
on most every one of us during
the enture passage.</p>

<p>On eht passage while slacking the main brace the mate gave
me a severe kick on the side and hit
me on the head with a wooden belaying
pin. On another occasion when
I was steeting, for the offence of being
1/4 of a point of the course, the Captain
braced himself up by holding
onto the top of the wheel house
and threw both his feet into my
side with all his force, which caused
my side to remain sort for a long
time.</p>

<p>We had only a bucket of water

containing about two gallons for the use
of twelve men for 24 hours, besides out

short allowance was to punish us
as there was over 4000 gallons of water
onboard.</p>

<p>On the second day after our 
arrival we refused duty waiting to see
the consul, but as the was absent we
preferred to go to jail until the consul

<p>On the passage, a certain morning
while serving on the hose to wash

<p>I have been hard of hearing

preceeding up to the time they broke
open the forecastle door. I was the
first put in irons. While forty eight
hours shut up I was forced from
thirst to drink my own water
While fastened in the forecastle
it came on to rain, and I held
a pot out of the window to try
and catch some rain water, when
the make snatched it out of my
hand. Threatening to shoot me
<catchwords>if</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.089"/>

if I did not desist. While in
irons, with my hands tied
behind me, the Mate put me in
the sweat box where I remained
two hours, I was almost dead when
they took me out, and while in this
cruel place of confinement I cried
for mercy. They opened the door and
put a gag into my mouth consisting
of a bar of iron tied round my head
and then closed the door again.
I was taken out of the sweat box
and put into the Cabin and then
returned to the sweat box again
and gagged as before. On June
17th while slacking the port
corchet braces, the mate called
me hard names, and struck me
with his fist, along the deck
and another time struck me with
his fist, when taking in the <unclear/>
sails.

testimony is also the same as
the three preceeding up to the time

We broke open the forecastle door

mate struck me with his fist
while clearing up the sails. My
hands were tied behind me which
caused me intense pain as I had
a sprained arm, and shoulder
I was then put in the sweat
box on the starboard side for
three hours and afterwards into
the after hatch where they cut
my lashings and I fell to the
deck from exhaustion and had
to be carried into the forecastle</p>

<p>On the passage the Captain
struck me with a hatchet
and cut my tarpaulin and
made four incisions on my
head, chin, fingers, and neck the
marks of which I can show you
The mate on another occasion kicked
me several times on the legs
as I went aft, and again another
time dealt me heavy blows on
the cheek.</p>

to duty.

That I am a native of Germany

in the ship Wm Cummings and on
the 10th June embarked and proceeded
in tow of a tugboat for
about 65 Miles down river, On the
 way down we made sail when the

of the crew. The next day, we
weighed anchor set sail and
commenced to beat down river

the mate abusing the crew for
trivial offences.</p>

<p>On the morning following all hands
knocked off duty on account of ill-usage
and requested the Captain
to call alongside the Revenue Cutter
which he refused to do, and shut
us all up in the forecastle 48 hours
without food or water. Our thirst
was so intense that some of us 
were obliged to drink their own
urine. At last we broke open the
forecastle door, when the Captain
and officers came forward and kept
us in with threats that if we came up they would shoot us
They secured some with irons and
tied others and subjected the
most of them to cruel treatment
such as putting them in sweat boxes &amp;c. After the pilot left
both captain and mate, treated 
the crew terribly, striking them
with their fists, iron belaying pins
handspikes and axes inflicting

the most fortunate of all the crew
I was not struck the entire passage
but noticed the brutal treatment 
to the rest.</p>

<p>Two days after out arrival
here I joined with the rest of
the crew to refuse duty, wishing
to lay our complaint, before
you but as you were about
we preferred to go to jail, rather
than return to duty and there

Beofre me. Augustus Archer Silva,
Commercial Agent of the Untied
States of America at St Paul de
Loanda, personally appeared Samuel
Walker, Steward on board the
American ship "Wm Cummings of
Philadelphia, and now being by me
duly sworn deposes and says as follows.</p>

<p>That I was born in Philadelphia
and reside at No 836 Pine Street
there and about the 4th of June
last shipped at Philadelphia
in the ship 'Wm Cummings and
on the 10th June proceeded in tow
of two steam tugs about 60 miles
down river.</p>

<p>
When the crew came aboard
I did not notice particularly if
any were drunk They rather appeared
to be sober. I did not notice
any of the officers strike then men
<catchwords>during</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.098"/>
the first three days, but heard
them use abusive language toward
the men I heard from the men that
the reason why they knocked off
was on account of one being struck
when the crew refused duty, I was
in the Pantry and say the second
mate tell the Captain that the
men, would not turn to. I heard then
afterwards say to the Captain that
their reason for knocking off was
on account of illtreatment, The
capatin asked them if they were
all sailors and they all answered
in the affirmative, I did not
hear the crew and the Captain
to go alongside the Revenue Cutter
as I was not present during
the whole comotion. The Captain
then locked them up in the forecastle
but I do not remember exactly the
length of time, they remained
there, They did not have anything
to eat or drink during their
confinement. They called me <unclear/>
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.099"/>

at the window and asked me to
request the Captain to give them
some water, but he refused to give
them any saying the water was
on board for them that worked
At length they burst open the
forecastle door, but showed
no signs whatever of mutiny they
seemed only to be asking for
water. The captain called Cook
and Steward but before I reached
the forecastle, I met the mate
with Charles White and returned
with them to the cabin to get the
irons for the mate to put on
White, four others were also put
in irons but I dont remember
if all the rest were tied, Some
were. I am certain, I saw the
mate strike three of the men
on different occasions with
a ropes end, during the passage
I did not see him strike any
with iron belaying pins, but
heard that he did so, and
<catchwords>I saw&#8212;</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.100"/>

saw the gashes inflicted on the
mens heads, several men were
put into what is termed the swear
box and kept there various lenghts
of time, said place has no ventilation
whatever except through the cracks and ther are very few of
them, There are two, of these places
they were built for the purpose of
during the hold, being a narrow
closet in the houses on deck, with
an inside door in the closet <unclear>an</unclear>
trap door leads to the hold which
with the outer is opened for ventilation
this place was used as a 
place of punishment for the sailors
which was easily converted into such
by closing the trap, and outside
door. Its dimensions are a very little larger
than and ordinary man.</p>

<p>It is true that Edward Perez
was sick in his berth. I heard
with a sprained arm, he was hauled
out and his arms tied behind him
and kept in that position several
<catchwords>hours</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.101"/>
<fw>21</fw>
hours notwithstanding his agony from
the pain caused by the sprained arm
It is also true that the mate took
one of the men out of the sweat
box, gagged him with an iron bar
and put him back again I knew
of the curcumstance of James
Wells being severly beaten by the
Captain as the hold and remember
of the mate jumping over the
side and kicking James Wells in
the face and thereby causing a
deep gash. The circumstances of
the Captain sticking Edward
Perez on the head with a hatchet
occurred before I turned out in the
morning but I also heard of it
and saw the gashes in his head
I also testify to the truth of the
deposition of Andrew Henwright
of being punished by being
lowered over the side when the
ship was rolling and that the
severity of his representation is
true, and also remember of the
<catchwords>circumstance</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.102"/>
circumstance of his being sent
aloft to slush down the mast
with a deep gash over his eye
and the blood running down his
face.</p>

<p>Alomst every day the entire
passage there was punishment
going on, and sometimes very severe
It is true that they had only one
bucket of water daily for the use
of twelve men during the whole
passage besides their pint of tea
and coffee.</p>

<p>About an hour before the men burst open the forecastle
door, the Revenue Cutter passed
alongside, and notwithstanding
the crew asked the Captain to
call her he refused to do so</p>

<p>The Pilot, who took us out, I

<p>
Before me Augustus Archer Silva,
Commercial Agent of the United States
of America at St Paul de Loanda,
personlly appeared Henry Polson, second mate
on board the American ship "Wm
Cummings" of Philadelphia
and now being by me duly sworn deposed and says 
as follows.</p>

<p>That I was born in Scotland
and am 26 years of age and reside at
No. 500 Penn Street Philadelphia,
and on the 4th of June last shipped
at Philadelphia on board the Ship
"Wm Cummings" and went onboard the
same day and on the 10th proceeded down
river in tow of two steam tugs, and
from that time to the 16th we worked
down river, anchoring at night.</p>

<p>I do not remember
of seeing during the first three days
<catchwords>either</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.106"/>

either the mate or Captain strike any
of the men. On the third morning
when I went to turn the men to they
refused duty on account they said of
heaving been illused by the chief mate.
They were then in consequence of that
locked up in the forecastle and kept
there from Wednesday at 6 am till Thuesday
at 1 pm during which time to
my knowledge they had nothing to
eat or drink. THey repeatedly asked
for food and water which was
refused them. I do not remember
if they requested the Captain to call
alongside the Revenue Cutter before
she passed this ship on Thursday
when they refused duty they showed no
signs of resistance. On Thuesday shortly
after 1 PM they broke open the forecastle door, but showed
no signs of
mutinous intentions, but all came forward
and stood outside the forecastle.
About half were then put into irons, two
were tied witht heir hands behind them
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.107"/>
and the rest put back into the forecastle
and all served out with bread and water.
At this time several of the crew tried to
throw the <unclear/> of themselves to get out
of irons by saying that certain others were
the rindleaders of the disturbance. The
supposed ringleaders were then severly
treated, such as being put into swear
boxes &amp; c. at various periods but none
of them kept longer than two hours.
The circumstance of a man being gagged
while in the sweat box is true, but
for what reason I cannot say. I have
seen the mate strike several of the crew
with belaying pins causing severe gashes
and afterwards saw them with blood
sunning down their faces. I never say the
Captain or mate strike any of the men at
the wheel. Regarding the statement in
referance to Edward Perez who was represented
to have been sick in his
berth with a sprained arm. It was <unclear>I</unclear>
who was ordered to have him out of his
berth and tie his hands behind his
<catchwords>back</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.108"/>
back when he took his knife and threatened
to cut me if I did so, notwithstanding
I did so. He complained
of pain in his shoulder and was let
loose an hour and a half afterwards.
The curcumstances connected with
James Wells being severly beaten in
the hold is true. In reference to
the mate kicking James Wells when
scraping the paint of the ships' side.
I did not see the mate kick him
but saw the gash on his cheek.
I did not see the Captain strike
Edward Perez with a batchet as
it was dark, but saw them in
contact and afterwards saw Edward
Perez with wounds on his head. It
is true that Andrew Henwright was lowered
into the water and kept there for 15
minutes
for the loss of a scraper. It
is also true of his being sent aloft to
slush down the doretopgallant mast
with a larde gash over his eye and
the blood running fown his face
<catchwords>Boat</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.109"/>
<fw>23</fw>

Boat No 4 took the pilot from the ship
when we left the breakwater.</p>

<p>I know nothing about how
much water was dealt out to the men.
Without the least doubt the treatment
toward the men was of the most barbarous
by the captain and mate, especially the latter.</p>

<p>Only about four of the
crew are expert able seamen the rest
ordinary.</p>

<p>I have never been struck by
either Captain or mate, but they have
often used toward me abusing language.</p>

<p>Before me Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent of the United States
of America at St. Paul de Loanda
personally appeared Charles W. Bennett
boy onboard of the American SHip
"Wm Cummings" of Philadelphia and
now being by me duly dworn deposes
and says as follows</p>

<p>That I was born in
Erie, Penn. and reside at 1228
North Twelfth Street Philadelphia
and am 19 years of age. On the
8th of June I shipped as boy on
board the ship "Wm Cummings" of
Philadelphia and embarked on the
10th and proceed down river in tow
of two steam tugs. We were about
six days getting down river. On
the third day out, I witnessed the
crew all refuse duty, on account they
<catchwords>alleged</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.112"/>

alleged of illusage. During the first day
I saw the mate strike one man when
pulling on the forebrace. I heard he
struck others but did not see him
do so. When the crew refused duty they
were locked into the forecastle and
kept there 36 hours, without food or
water. They repeatedly asked for both,
especially the latter, but were refused.
I did not know at the time
that the men wanted the Revenue Cutter
to be called alongside. I heard onboard
that the cutter did pass us
during the confinement of the men.
The crew finally burst open the forecastle
door. The Captain and officers, myself
steward and cook then went forward:
 the former armed. They made no resistance
whatever, five were put into irons and the
rest had their arms tied behind them.
In this state some of the men wre put
into the hatch house, temporaroly
used as a sweat box, and some of them
kept their four hours. The hatch house
<catchwords>is</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.113"/>
is an awful place, no air holes and no
room beyond the size of a man and
the day of this confinement was a very
hot one. I saw the men quite ehausted
when taken out their eyes swollen &amp;c for
want of air. It is true that one of the men was gagged when in the sweat box.
I saw the first and second mate haul
Edward Perez out of his berth and tie
his hands behind him. I heard him
groan with pain and learned he had a
lame shoulder and arm. I know of the
severe brutal flogging the Captain gave
James Wells while at work among some
li=umber in the hold. I did not see
the mate kick James Wells in the face
but heard that he did so, and saw
thr wound which he had made on his
 (James Wells') face. I did not see the
Captain strike Edward Perez, as it was my watch
below, but hear that
he had done so and saw the cuts on
his head. It is true that the mate
lowered Andrew Henwright over the ship's
<catchwords>side</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.114"/>
side for punishment for breaking a scraper
when scraping over the side. He was
into the water up to his neck and the
ship was rolling at the time and going
through the water about three knots or
thereabouts. The mate also on another
occasion struck this man in the gace
cutting a severe gash. This happened at
4 am. just as our watch was going below;
I heard afterwards that the man
was sent aloft, without being allowed
to dress the wound, with the blood running
rown his face.</p>

<p>During the passage the mate struck some of the men almost
every day, with his fist, belaying pin, ropes'
end or whatever he could lay his
hand first upon. He was very brutal
to the crew and constantly using extreme
blasphemous language, and insulting the
honor of all.</p>

<p>None of the officers have ever
struck me but the mate has cursed
me often.</p>

<p>That I was born at St Thomas
and am a Portuguese subject. I

aboard the ship Wm Cummings as
Cook. I went on board a few days
previous to this date, about the
10th June, we left Philadelphia
in tow of two steam tugs and
anchored for the night about
60 miles down river. We were afterwards
a few days beating down
river, but I dont remember how
<catchwords>many</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.118"/>

many. The first two days I saw the
mate strike and kick some of the crew
on the thrid morning after we left all
the crew refused duty on account I
heard them say of illtreatment, in consequence
they were locked up in the forecastle
and kept there nearly two days
without food or water. They repeatedly
asked for food and water, particularly
the latter. I was the bearer of a message
to the Captain for food and water when
he refused both unless they turned to
I heard their request to have the Revenue
Cutter called along side, which was
also refused by the Captain, notwithstanding
the Revenue Cutter subsequently passed along side. The crew showed no
mutinous conduct further than the
simple refusal of duty and even when
they broke open the forecastle door
they made no resistance whatever
but allowed themselved to be put in
irons or tied. The statement of several
of the men of being put in a narrow closet
temporarily used as a

sweatbox is true, and I heard that

his confinement there. The sweat box
is a terrible place causing great
suffering to those confined there there
being intense hear and no air
I saw the mate strike three of the
men causing severe wounds I do
not remember of more than one he struck with an iron belaying
pin, and saw the blood running
from the mans wounds. I was in
the gally where edward Perez
was hauled out of his berth
and his hands tied behind him
I head that his arm and shoulder
was strained and saw him suffer
in consequence I know of James
Wells being severly beaten by the
Captain in the hold on the passage
because the Captain told me
he would serve me the same way
if I wasnt careful where i put
the wood. I was told at the time
it occured and also saw the wound
<catchwords>that</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.120"/>

that the mate kicked James Wells
severely on the face, while scraping
the ships side. I was told at the
time it occured that the Captain
struck Edward Perez several times
on the head with a hatchet inflicting
severe gashes. I also saw the gashes I saw the mate lower
Andrew Henwright into the water
up to his neck and keep him there 15 minutes or more or less
when the ship was rolling and going about three knots, I did not see the
mate strike a severe wound on Andrew Henwrights eye and then send him aloft to work as I was in my
room at the tome, but heard of
the sircumstance from the crew and
saw the gash as he afterward came
to me for more slush to grease
the mast.</p>

<p>Up to about a week out I
was allowed to give the men two
buckets of water a day but the
mate became spiteful towards
<catchwords>them</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.121"/>

<fw>27</fw>
them and ordered me to give them
only one bucket per 24 hours which
was not half as much as they
ordinarily required, not withstanding
there was an abundance of fresh
water on board.</p>

<p>On account of my gally bring so
far forward I never saw the mate or
Captain strike or kick anybody at
the wheel but hear several complaints
from the crew of being severly
abused there</p>

<p>During the entire passage scarcely
a day passed without its coming
to my knowledge that either the Captain
or Mate struck or beat some one
The captain and mate made use
of extremely blasphemous language
during the whole passage.</p>

<p>The officers never struck me abused
me only by language. The Captain
never interfered with the mate
but allowed him to act as he
pleased.</p>

<p>Before me, Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent of the United States
at St Paul de Loanda, personally appeared
Henry Miller, first mate on
board of the American Ship "Wm Cummings"
of Philadelphia and now
being by me duly sworn deposes and
says as follows</p>

<p>That I was born in Philadelphia
and am 31 years of age and reside
at 12 Wilson St. below Chishan
St. Philadelphia. On the 8t June
I shipped as first Mate on board
the ship Wm Cummings of Philadelphia.
I have served as Chief
Officer on board this ship for nearly
four years. We loaded coal at Philadelphia
for St Paul de Loanda
and took our departure on 10th June
When the crew came on board on the
morning of the 10th part were drunk
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.125"/>

and part were sober. We proceeded
down the river in town of two small
tugs, and when about a mile from
the City commenced to make sail
as the wind was fair, and when
the crew were making sail I discovered
that the greater part of them
were not the able seamen for which
they had shipped. After sail was
made, they were then set to work
to put our chafing gear &amp;c. which
they had to be shown how to do. When
the Pilot ordered sail to be taken in
I was on the top gallant forecastle
giving orders to part of the Crew to clear
the lower foretop sail up and after
giving the order four times there was
not one of them could find the fore
top sail clue line. I then jumped
and showed them by taking hold
of it myself. I then gave one a
push and went on the opposite
side where I saw difficulty
occured, and it was then I gave
one a slap on the face. We finished
<catchwords>clearing</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.126"/>
clearing up sail and anchored and did
other necessary work in regard to securing
theings about deck. On the next day
we got under weigh with an ebb tide
and head wind and beat down about
14 miles and then anchored and again
furled sail. We kept the anchor
watch. I dont remember striking any
of the crew more than what I have
already stated up to this time. The
following morning (the 12th) about 5
oclock the second mate went forward
to turn the men to. The crew told him
that they would not work any more
and he came adft and told me I then
went forward and also asked them to
turn to, and they gave me the same
reply. I then went aft and told the
Captain, and he went forward and asked
then what was the matter and they
said "they had been illtreated" The
Captain said "did I illuse you" and
they said "no," "Then why did you
not come aft and make your complaint
to me" and not knock off. I have
<catchwords>done</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.127"/>
done nothing to harm you do you
call this treating me right. But
they only answered that they would
not turn to any more. The Captain
then said I will go to no more trouble
with you. So they were locked up in
the forecastle. This occurred about
6 am on the 12th of June. They remained
confined in the forecastle
till between 8 and 9 oclock on the
following day, when the burst open
the forecastle door. During their confinement
they had no food or water
given them, but when they burst
open the door, there was a biscuit
found on one of the mens chests
and a pot with some fresh water
The Captain and myself went forward
armed and when we approached
them they all drew their knives
After we had taken away their
knives, we found they had all been
freshly sharpened, probably with
a file, as one was found in the
forecastle. I took one of the
<catchwords>men</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.128"/>
<fw>29</fw>

men named Charlie and brought
him aft and put him in irons
The men made no resistance when
they were confined. We put 5 men
in irons and tied the hands of
two others, one of whom had his
hands tied behind him. He resisted
being secured, but we forced him to
it. His name is Edward Perez
He was kept in that position about
an hour, when we learned that
his arm had been hurt on board
another ship in the Calcutta River
We then tied his hand before him
About an hour afterwards, the
Captain told me to go forward and
ask them one by one to turn to
They said they would, some gave
them water. Then I asked them that
were in irons and tied up the same
question and in the same manner
and they said they would if the
rest would. They did not turn to
then but an hour later five of
them did and they also got water
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.129"/>

and food. The remaining two in
irons about two hours later <unclear/>
to turn to and they got food
and water also but were not released
from irons as we did not think
it prudent to do so. In the presence
of the Pilot, Mr Hughes, James
Wells was asked by me, who were
the ringleaders of the trouble and
he said that Charlie Smith was
the man. Charlie Smith said in
presence of said pilot second mate
and myself that if any of them would
turn to, he would cut their guts
out and if he could not do that
the first time, they were in the top
sailyard, he would heave them
off. When this was repeated in
his presence he hund down his
head. When the Pilot was discharged
the Captain called the two men
after they were released from irons
and reprimanded them for their
conduct and Charlie Smith begged
the Captains pardon with
<catchwords>out</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.130"/>

out him asking him to do so, as all
he wanted he said was to return
to duty so he went to work I
subsequently found about five of
the crew who could do their work
pretty well as seamen.</p>

<p>I did not know that the
crew wanted to have a Revenue
Cutter come alongside. I believe that
one did pass while they were in
confinement in the forecastle I
confined four seamen to a passage
way which leads to between decks
but dont remember how long I kept
them as I did not note the time
To the best of my knowledge none
were kept there over an hour, I acted
under orders from the Captain. One
of the men was gagged while in
one of these places for making a
noise.</p>

<p>I deny the charge of striking beating
or kicking James Wells when
released from the wheel but I
did slap him alongside the head be

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.131"/>

cause he would not steer and when
putting a strop on the forebrace
I only struck him once or twice with
a ropeend. I don't remember striking
James Wells with a mallet or not
I remember of kicking James Wells
when he was trying to sling a stage
and could not do it, I don't know
whether I kicked him on the
face or not, I did not strike him
with a marlinespike, and cut a
gash in his forehead, and dont
know who did. I remember of approaching
him from behind and
striking him senseless to the deck
while pulling on the mainbrace
Dont remember kicking Andrew
Henwright at the wheel for
striking the bell out of time. The
compaint of Andrew Henwright
of me striking him with an iron
belaying pin is not as he represents.
He said something to me
which I supposed was insolence
and as I approached him he 
<catchwords>took</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.132"/>
<fw>30</fw>

took me by the throat, I in
self defense took a wooden belaying
pin and struck him over the
head several times, but I cant
say whether I caused any wound
or not. I did not see the blood
running over his face when I sent
him aft. Five or six of them men
were ordered to clean the ships
side with brooms and scrapers
Andrew Henwright broke a new
scraper over the port side. I did
lower the said Andrew Henwright
into the water to scrape the
remainder of the barnacles off
the ships side. He was not exhausted
or sick when taken up
as he represents.</p>

<p>I did not strike Henry Beckwith
with the metal end of the Hose
but struck him with a <unclear>cane broom</unclear>
I did not know if I wounded him
I admit that I struck him several
times for nonfulfillment of duty
(as I did others) which I had
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.133"/>
to do myself.</p>

<p>I think I did unintentionally
strike John Little with an iron
belaying pin during the passage
and inflict woulds, but that was
also for nonfulfillment of duty
I deny the charge of striking him
at the wheel, with an iron 
<unclear/>
</p>

<p>I do not remember of striking
during the passage John H. Davis.</p>

<p>Regarding the quantity of
water dealt out for the daily use
of these men, as represented by them
is untrue, as there was between
2500 to 3000 gallons of water consumed
on board ship during
the passage of 82 days and they
had the greater part of it To the
best of my knowledge a gallon
per man a day viz. a quart
of coffee in morning, evening a
quart of tea 2 1/2 gallons of water
each morning to cook their breakfast
and about 4 galls for
<catchwords>dinner</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.133"/>
dinner and 1 gallon for supper, besides
this they had until 40 days
out an average 5 gallons fresh
water per day. Two hundred gallons
would only last five or six days.</p>

<p>Before me Augustus Archer Silva
Commercial Agent of the United States
of America at St. Paul de Loanda personally
appeared George E. Miller,
master on board the American Ship
"Wm Cummings" of Philadelphia
and now being by me duly sworn
deposes and says as follows</p>

<p>That I was born in Philadelphia
and reside at 33 Catherine Street
Philadelphia. I have been master
of the ship "Wm Cummings" for
about four years. My owners chartered
the vessel to take a cargo of coal to
St Paul de Loanda for the United
States Government. When loaded on
the 8th June last the crew was shipped,
and on the 10th they came on
board and we proceeded down river in
tow of two steam tugs. When said
<catchwords>crew</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.137"/>
crew came onboard I noticed that part
were under the influence of liquoe and part
sober. We were about four days working
down river. I did not strike or ill-
treat any of the men during the first
two days going down river neither did
I see the Mate do so. On the third
morning, after leaving Philadelphia, at
5 oclock all the crew refused duty.
The second mate reported to me the circumstance
and I went forward and asked them what was the matter, and why they would not turn to. They said the mate
had struck one of them and for that
reason, they would not turn to. I
then told them that as the mate did
not have charge of the vessel, the ought
to have reported to me when they
were struck but as they had taken the
law into their own hands I considered
it as a mutiny. They told me they
did not consider it as such but even
if it was so they would not turn to.
I called them all by name and asked
<catchwords>them</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.138"/>
them one by one if they would not
go to work. They answered "no sir
I then told the mate to shut the
dorecastle door. That night the mate
and I stood watch. The next mroning
at 9 oclock the crew burst open
the forecastle door. I ran forward with
a pistol in my hand and the men
drew their knives. I told them that
if they did not drop their knives
I would fire at them. The mate then
came forward and caught one of the men
by the collar and took him aft,
and then returned and we put five of them in irons; as those were all the
irons we had on board. Three men
went back into the forecastle while
the others were being put into irons
These men were afterwards tied with
their hand behind them, and taken
from the forecastle and put down in
to the lazaret &#8212; two others in the cabin
and two others into a passage leading
from each side of the house to
<catchwords>between</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.139"/>

between decks, termed the sailors <del/> seat
box. The two put into the last mentioned
place of confinement agreed to
turn to, and were therefore taken out
and replaced by other two. The
circumstance of one of these men being
gagged while in one of these closets
is unknown to me. I did not put
them in these places of confinement for
punishment but for safe keeping. I
did not know that they suffered any
ehen confined there. The crew while
in the forecastle had nothing to ear
or drink. I refused to give them anything
until the would turn to work.
They made no resistance except when
they drew their knives after bursting
open the forecastle. During the entire
passage I did not see the mate
strike any of the men, neither was I
made aware that he did so, nor did
I see any wounds. I did not strike
or kick any of the men at the wheel. In
reference to Andrew Henwright being <catchwords>lowered</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.140"/>
<fw>32</fw>

ered into the water in a bowline for
punishment. I gave ordered to have
the barnacles scraped of the ships'
side. He was therefore lowered into
the water to do this work not for
punishment as represented. Edward
Perez had no sprained arm when his
hands were tied behind him, as at
1 pm of the same day he turned to
duty. The representation made by James
(Wells) Caldan about my thrashing him
severly, is in part incorrect. I had
ordered him to move some chain, which
he did, also moving a lot of
firewood which he had no order
to move. I ordered him to take the
wood back again to where he took it
from, but he leaving some I asked
him why he did so, and he said
that it had been there before, when
I knew perfectly well that it was
not so. He contradicted me several
times, saying that the wood was
there, and for that reason I struck
<catchwords>him</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.141"/>
him several times with a piece of board
I deny the accusation of Edward Perez of
having struck him with a hatchet four
times, as I only struck him with my fist,
and I know not how the wounds have come
on his head.</p>

<p>I never limited the crew
either in quantity of water or food, nor
do I know the mate ever did.</p>

That I was born in Jersey City

on board the 'William Cummings' on
the 8th of June last, and went on board
June 10th and proceeded down river in
tow of a steam tug, and get under
weigh and anchored seceral times
in our passage down river during

call the Revenue Cutter, along
<catchwords>-side</catchwords>


<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0082.144"/>
-side the Revenue Cutter, which he
refused to do. He drove us into the forecastle
and kept us there about 48 hours
without food or water. Our thirst was
so intense, I even saw some of the
men drink their own water. We
repeatedly requested the Captain
to give us even the lowest allowance
of prison food, which he refused
I was struck and kicked in most
every watch during the passage
and on one occasion in particular
he struck me on the head, with an
iron belaying pin which caused a
severe wound. The marks I now show
you. He also on another occasion
struck me with a marline spike
which broke my head in two
places I have also six scars on
my head now which you can see
I was also struck at the wheel
with an iron <unclear>pump break.</unclear>
