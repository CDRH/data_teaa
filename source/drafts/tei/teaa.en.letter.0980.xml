<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to respectfully transmit herewith my quarterly returns and account for the 4th quarter, 1879.</p>

There should be an additional receipt for £2-3-10, making a total of £5-12-6; this was partially the result of a mistake in sending the Illustrated London News instead of the Daily Times- which I desired. You will observe the correction made, but an absence of <catchwords>receipt</catchwords>

receipt for £2-3-10, on account of my letter containing drafts in payment- to B. F. Stevens, London- not having reached England in time for an answer to be sent inclosing receipt for balance.</p>

<p>Salary account and accompanying certificate. In the account, I have returned the U.S. balance of $40.71 from account of Relief of Destitute American Seamen, according to my balance heretofore reported, and as appears from the adjustment of said account by Fst. Comptroller.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, With <sic>higest</sic> sentiments of esteem and consideration, Your obedient servant</p>
