<p>Department of State
    Monrovia February 2, 1882</p>

<p>Sir
      I am directed by the President after careful and anxious
   deliberation in the Cabinet to request you lay before your govern-
   ment the following:</p>

<p>   The Republic of Liberia whose origin and history are well
   known to the govenrment of the United States has now reached
   a period in her history when she surely needs and is fully able to
   bear a large influx of civilized descendants of Africa from the
   United States. An important addition to her civilized population
   is imperatively demanded if she is to go extending her influence
   and pushing her free insitutions against the encroachment of
   foreigners.</p>

<p>    The natives in the interior of the Republic are anxious for
   the planting of civilized settlements on the beautiful hills and in
   the futile valleys which diversify their interesting country. We are 
   pushing on as fact as we can get the emmigrants from the United
   States and our new settlements of civilized industry
    as they advance.</p>

<p>     Arthington and Bremerville foundecd about two years ago in
   dense forests by freed men from North Carolina, Mississipi, Alabama</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.002"/>

<p>Lousiana and Arkansas are now beautiful coffee groves with their
   computable fame buildings Christian Churches, School houses and
   workshops, and as the Represetatives of teh Christian religion and
   of American life are attracting the Aborigines drawing them both
   within and around the settlments. But in view of the most work
   to be done, it is comparatively little that can be prosecuted or accom
   plished by the few emigrants sent out at irregular intervals by a
   private association depending for its means upon voluntary contri-
   butions.</p>

<p>     For the last ten or fiften years the operations of the American
   Colonization Society have been confined to one section of the
   Republic for the most of means to send immigrants tas formerly
   to different points along the Coast. The consequence is that the
   civilized population in the three forward coutnries is rapidly dimin
   ishing and leaving the Aborigines to the money of the intrigues
   of designing foreigners who are anxious to see the prestige of Liberia
   not only lowered but destroyed among the natives on the Coast,
   hoping that eventually the six hundred miles of much coveted
   coast with its accessible and desirable interior to the commercial
   possibilities of Liberia, and the dangers to which she is exposed from
   external agencies I beg to refer you to the dispatch of the Hon.
   John H. Smyth the late Minister Resident here published in the
   Foreign Relations of teh United States for 1880. pp 694-707
                                                              The</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.003"/>

<p>The native wars which seem periodically among the Aborigines
   and whicha re the result in part of olod feuds leaving their <unclear/>
   in the days of the horrible slave trade, can never be permanently
   suppressed on the Coast and in the adjacent interior the
   presence in these territories of civilized settlements. Even in the
   immediate pressure a neighborhood of so powerful a government
   as that of Sierra Leone it is impossible to present the <unclear/> of
   desoltaing wars in the purely native districts to the detriment of
   trade and against the progress of the people.</p>

<p>     The Shebro and Sierra Leone rivers within British jurisdiction
   and having no settlements of civilized people are frequently the secure
   ruinous tribal wars, while the St Paul's, the Jank, the St. John's,
  and the SImoe Rivers within Liberian jurisdiction and settled by
  Colonists are entirely free from such disturbances. It is in the
  Northwestern and South eastern frontiers of the Republic and 
  in localities within our boundaries distant from the civilized 
  settlements where periodical wars now occur, and where trade
  is interrupted.</p>

<p>    The long pending question relating to the Northwestern boun-
   dary of the Republic is a source of continual annoyance and
   imitation; and the arrangement of it appears to be beyond the
  scope of ordinary diplomacy. The country must be settled by
  civilized immigrants</p>

<p>    During the negotiations of 1850 with aboriginal author-
                                                            ities</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.004"/>

<p>ities for the cession of the Gallenas and adjacent territory which
   Liberia now claims as it Northwestern limits the Commissions of the
   Liberian government agreed that seboats should be established
   and settlements made in that part of the country, but the need
   of immigrants in other portions of the Republic, and the supply
   from United States being very limited prevented teh government
   from carrying out that part of its promise to the Gallinas people
   qnd the scarcity of men for the educational necessities of the
   country, prevented the sending of teachers to them. This caused
   dissatisfaction among them and was used by <unclear/> foreign-
   ers to stimulate their hostility to the Republic. But the govern-
   ment is satisfied set that the establishment of settlement in the
   country would set at rest forever all disputes about boundary,
   and bring the Aborigines pacefully under the unquestioned
   jurisdiction of Liberia.</p>

<p>     In view of an increased manifestation of a determin-
   ation of some of the European powers to take advantage of the
   commercial possibilites of this country: it is now a time of con-
   siderable anxiety witht his government. The efforts of British
   traders in our immediate neighborhood in the North. French
   enterprises in the Northeast, the settlers condition of the Aborigines
   in some sections of our Republic, all conspire to cause us, no little
   claim. Every thing is <unclear/> uncertain, and if we do not
   yet an accession of intelligent and enterprising immigrants over</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.005"/>

<p>conditions may become very serious indeed.</p>

<p>     It is in view of these facts that the President directs me
   to ask the assistance of your govenrment to send us a few of
   the thousand of civilized Christian negroes in your country, who
   are anxious to cast in their lot with Liberia, but who lack
   the means of transportation and of u start on their arrival
   in the land of their fathers.</p>

<p>     Large numbers of people in the Southern section of 
   your country of good industrious habits, who would be hardly
   missed from the six millions of colored people, have been for
   years making application to the government of the United States
   for aid to emigrate to the land of their fathers.</p>

<p>     These people who would not be missed among you would 
   create anation on this side of the water.</p>

<p>     Liberia is theoffspring of Ameircan benevolence and
   this little Republic in Western Africa has excited an influence
   upon the adjacent tribes almost without a parallel in 
   the history of Colonies. A few thousand immigrants
   from the United States have drawn under their influence
   from the stagnant and barren healthemism of eyes over a
   million of people, and without face a money have assimi-
   lated them by industrial, social and religious influence
   and made them a part of a christian Republic based upon
   the traditions of the United States.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.006"/>

<p>The Republic of Liberia in these features of freedom and equal <unclear/>
   of universal education, withotu distinction of classes which so force
   ably impresss the aboriginal mind, is an illustration of the kind
   and practice of American institutions. Half of the public domain
   of Liberia is held in trust for the settlement of the black people
   of the United States. Every black man in America has a claim 
   to a  homestead in Liberia and the government is bound by
   law to grant ten acres of land to every adult, and twenty-fice
   acres to every family who come to this country from the
   United States.</p>

<p>     Our selections then to the American government are
   peculiar and are claim to sympathy and assistance from
   the United States is almost that of an American Colony.</p>

<p>     In view of these facts therefore, and of the fact that
   the Ameircan Colonizatioin Society is unable to cope with the
   present exigences of the war, and in view also of the past which
   the American government from the beginning of the colony has
   always taken in forwarding its interest, the President feet
   that he may venture is solicity aid from your government
   to increase are civilized population, strengthjen the foundations,
   and enlarge the boundary of the State, and consequently spread
   never and quietness throughout districts was harried leg restless
   marauders thus opening and keeping open a <unclear/> for the
   vast trade of Soudan which could be easily <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.007"/>

<p>direction instead of giving in such large quantities <unclear/> the desert
   is the Mediterranean; and the demand for American manufacture
   in the interior is practically unlimited.</p>

<p> The President also desires me to say that it would be of in-
   calculable advantage if one of the United States could
   be detailed from the Mediterranean squadron since a year
   between the months of December and March to cruise on 
   the Liberian Coast. This would reatly assist us in maintain
   ing the prestige of the Republic among the Aborigines at distant
   point from the settlement along the Coast and in infusing
   new energy into the movement of our reviewed affairs. Foods
   want of a Cloust police the revenue from the Customs is very
   inadequately collected.</p>

<p>     The President ventures to call attention to the fact <unclear/>
   among the members of these who fostered Liberia in her early
   days, and who did not think it contrary to the laws of the
   United States that your government should assist this
   infant nation were leading American statesmen such as 
   Prsident Madison and Monroe in honor of whom the capital
   is named, Chief Justice Marshalls. Rushed Washington, General
   Casper, Henry Lelay, Daniel Webster, Rufus King, Edmond Everett
   and others. The President hope therefore that it will be <unclear/>
   <unclear/> within the competence and ability of the United States
   government to come to the help of Liberia in the present
                                                    emergency</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.008"/>

<p>emergency by small appropriation to aid deserving person to come
   and occupy the localities threatened from abroad, and thus <unclear/>
   us from the anxieties which perplex, and the dangers which <unclear/>
   us.</p>

<p>I am further interested to say that for these advantages which
   we ask of the United States, the government of Liberia will be pre-
   pared under a special treaty to concede certain privileges to American
   citizens doing business in Liberia, not granted to other foreigners-
   privilege which if American capitalists would avail themselves of
   them, would give them the virtual control of u large portion of the
   trade of Coastal African and American products and shipping would 
   infer advantages which European traders have many years
   sought in vain at the hands of the government of Liberia.
   The whole <unclear/> country lies before the American traders and
   agriculturists through Liberia the country to the penetration
   and commercial possession of which French inspiration and
   energies are now directed.</p>

<p>     Should your government take into favorable consider-
   ation the requests andpropostitions made in this communication
   and should desire it, the President will appoint one or two
   special commissioners to visit Washington to treat with the
   government of the United States in relation to these im-
   portant matters.
            Availing myself of this opportunity to assure you of </p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0199.009"/>

<p>my very high consideration and esteem.
                I have the honor to be Sir
                    your most obedient servant.
                        G.W. Gibson</p>

        Secretary of State
