<p>Department of State
    Monrovia August 12, 1869</p>

<p>Sir
        I have the honor
   to announce to you for 
   the informaton of the
   government of the United
   States of America, the
   fact, that too the Terri-
   torial jurisdiction of this
   Republic, commencing on the
   Northwest at the River
                    Long</p>

<p>Honorable Hamilton Fish
   Secretary of State of the
   United State of America
                   Washington</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0187.002"/>

<p>be made to yield the greatest
   amount of benefit to both governments.
   He considers that the affinity of the
   respective governments should
   encourage a disposition to strengthen
   this realtion when an opportunity
   offers, so as to secure the mutual
   advantages which tis calculated
   to promote. He is not forgetful in
   this solicitation of the disparity,
   in point of ability, between the
   government Liberia, the offspring,
   and that of the mother Republic.</p>

<p>     Nevertheless he is
   of the opinion that the capability
   of Liberia to administer importantly
   to the commerce of the United States
   would justify an arrangement between
   the two governments by which
                                they</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0187.003"/>

<p>they could be mutually benefited
   to an unprecedented extent.</p>

<p>     These considerations
   have prompted the President of
   Liberia to direct, that an inquiry
   be enactt respectfully communicated
   to Your Excellency of the following
   character.</p>

<p>     Whether the commercial
   transactions of the citizens of the
   United States with Liberians
   might not be expanded by a
   proper discrimination between
   the products of free and slave
   labor in the form of a moderation
   of the duties on sugar, coffee,
   canwood and Palm Oil imported into
   the United States by Liberian
   vessels on the vessels of citizens of
                                       the</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0187.004"/>

<p>United States.
   Second. Whether in view of the
   necessity in Liberia of the proper
   class of immigrants to build up and
   strengthen her, and to contribute
   to the development of her resources
   and in view of the necessity of 
   the emigration of the colored people
   of the United States the government
   of the U. States would consent to
   facilitate an undertaking by
   LIberia to attract and bring
   to her shores, such of these
   people as might be willing to emigrate.</p>

<p>         Referring to the first
   querry, it is only necessary to invite
   Your Excellency's attention to
   these facts: that the commerce
   of Libera, yet in its inciperiency,
                            cannot,</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0187.005"/>

<p>cannot, ofr some years, render
   the influence of a competition
   witht he products of older states,
   especially those of slave labor,
   because as vigorous and profitable
   as it would that the work of
   enfranchisement and the abrogation
   of the slave trade,m in which the
   government of the United States
   takes preeminentlly the lead,
   would be promoted by the difficulty
   of introducing the products of
   slave labor into the U. States;
   and the fact, known too all
   to be named, that the government
   of H.R. Majesty impose no duty
   on Palm Oil introduced into her
                            dominions</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0187.006"/>

<p>dominions from the Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>         On the subject of the
   account query, it is proper to
   remark that the difficulty of
   procurring a class of immigrants
   much needed in the whole country,
   and especially to occupy contested
   points clearly within the political
   jurisdiction of the Republic of Liberia,
   will constrain the government of
   Liberia, herself, to invite an emigrate
   them by the permission and aid
   of the Mother Republci.</p>

<p>         With sentiments of the
   highest consideration.
            I have the honor to be
            Your Excellency's
            most obedient servant
                <unclear/></p>
