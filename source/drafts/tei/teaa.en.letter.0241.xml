My Dear Sir,
I have just received a leter from Mr.G.H.S Hale, of Balt. in which he says "I have several times been told that "Mr.Taylor was borin in Balt. His relatives "reside here, <unclear=and sign/> several are personally known to me "When I last saw him he had not given "up his allegiance, and I have not hear "of his doing so since."

Yours most <unclear/>
