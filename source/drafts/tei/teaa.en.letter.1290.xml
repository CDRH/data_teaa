<p>Subject.
The death of Vice C. General
Beverly Y. Payne, at North

<p>Synopsis
Mrs Amanda Smith, colored
Evangelist 147th St, North Harvey,
Ill., U. S. A. under date of
Sept. 21, 1900, writes the
sister of Vice Consul General,
Beverly Y. Payne, of the hopeless
and declining condition
of her brother, and proposes to forward
the remains to Liberia in Nov.</p>

<p>No. 50. Consular.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia,
Oct. 26 1900.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have to transmit to
you the intelligence, that we
are very indefinitely informed
here: through the kindess of Mrs.
Amanda Smith, the colored
Evangelist, 147th Street, North
Harvey Ill. under date of
Sept. 21, 1899, that General
Beverly Y. Payne, of Liberia,
United States Vice Consul
General of this Consulate
General; who sailed from
this post for America, March
29, 1900 for treatment, died
at the house of our informer
Mrs.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3121.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>Mrs. Amanda Smith, colored
Evangelist, 147th Street, North
Harvey Ill. at some time
near the 21st September 1900.
Do we, as well as the
surviving relatives here, the
kindness, to inquire after, the
particulars and if possible,
cause his effects &amp;c, which
were with him, consisting
possibly, only of a travellers
outfit, money &amp;c to be
forwarded back to Liberia, with
whatever information obtainable.</p>

<p>Since we have a
Secretary of the Legation, who
is by virtue of his office, placed
in charge of the Legation, in
case of the inability of the
Chief of the Mission to perform
the duties of the Legation or his absence from
the Mission; I hardly see the
present necessity for recommending
any one for Vice Consul General here; since
under</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3122.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>under the new requirement
for furnishing bond, in the
United States, necessarily intails
an annual expense; giving
only official title without
compensation, which has caused
no little annoyance, and
has worked very dissatisfactorily
to the incumbent; here.
However, I await your advice.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
your obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith
M. R. and C. General.</p>
