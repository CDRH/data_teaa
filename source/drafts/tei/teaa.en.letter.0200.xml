<p>Department of State
   Monrovia. August 23, 1886</p>

<p>Sir,
        In lieu of the vacancy
   of present existing in the
   Legation of the United
   States at Monrovia occa-
   sioned by the loss so recently
   sustained <unclear/>, in the decease
   of the Honorable M.A. 
   Hopkins the esteemed 
   Minister President of the
   United Staes near this 
   government, and not having
   been officially informed
   of the appointment of any 
   Vice Consul here for your 
   government, I have the
   honor by direction of
   The President to commu-
   nicate to the government
   of the United States the
                    following</p>

<p>Hon
    T.F. Bayard
    Secretary of State
    Department of State
    Washington D.C.
    U.S.A</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.002"/>

<p>following circumstances
   which in his opinion con-
   stitute a grave peril for
   the territorial integrity,
   and even the very existence
   of this Republic.</p>

<p> During the year 1883,
   the attention of the government
   of the United States was
   called to contain suspicious
   movements on the part of
   the French government
   toward Liberia, apparently
   looking towards a forcible
   seizure of a portion of our
   territory known as Kents
   island, in the Jammah
   River, in our northwestern
   territories and concernibg
   which the Honorable
   J.H. Smyth Minister
   Resident of the United States,
   while communicating at the 
   request of this government,
   49 diplomatic, which he had
   received from Mr Secretary
   Frelinghuysen and dated
                      Department</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.003"/>

<p>Department of State, Wash-
   ington August 19, 1884, was
   <unclear/> "I was
   pleased to enclose the <unclear/>
   and to ask that parts deep me
   advised, as to any nation
   of France against the
    territorial integrity of the Republic."</p>

<p> In <unclear/> witht his re-
   quest the undersigned found
   the honor to carry to Minister 
   Smyth <unclear/> the 1st and
   2nd December 1885; the intel-
   ligence of the doings of the
   French naval Department
   Armoux of the gun boat
   "Gabeo" at Faniby in our
   South Eastern Territory,
   and to request him to trans-
   mit the same for the infor-
   mation of his government.</p>

<p> Our Chargè d'Affaires
   at Paris was also communi-
   cate with under date of
   8/10 December 1885, and
   digested to bring the actions
   of the Armouxto knowledge
                           of</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.004"/>

<p>of his government, in order
   that a stop might be put 
   to such unfriendly actions
   on the part ther subordi-
   nates (see Enclosure I.)</p>

<p> On the 25th of February
   1886, this government re-
   ceived another illustration
   fo the hostile intentions of
   France towards it, by the
   visit of the Voltigeur Captain
   Durmont, to Berèly and 
   Monrovia, and his declara-
   tions made to the govern-
   ment at the latter place.
   In respouse to a note of
   inquiry received" from-
   Minister Hopkins (see
   Enclosure 1a), the under-
   signed made him acquain-
   ted of his government,
   and in the 3rd paragraph
   of that communication
   of the United States his
   impossessions as to the
                complicity</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.005"/>

<p>complicity of the French
   government with (in), the actions
   of its officers, and their 
   real was some toward
   this Republic. (see Enclosure 2)</p>

<p> Our representation at
   Paris was again requested
   to bring this bolder act of
   agression to the notice of 
   the French government, and
   again to request that its 
   naval officers be prohibited
   in fture from the exercise of
   such reprehensible actions
   against the territories of a 
   friendly state. (See Enclosure)</p>

<p> I have the honor to cor-
   respondence was between the
   United States Legation 
   and this Department, and
   also between the government
   and our Chargè d'Affaires
   at Paris, on this anbig</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.006"/>

<p>our representation, and
   endeavoring to lull our
   suspicions to sleep, have
   at length boldy thrown off  the mask, by declaring that
   by a Treaty by Law of Cessin granted the Chiefs af frfom
   and Litte Berely in the year
   1868, thoses territories ceded to that government,
   (see Enclsoure M. Carrance)
   to President Gahneur.) thus
   freely injustify that appre=
   hensions which were expres-
   sed by the undersigned to
   Minister Hopkins in his despatch
   before mentioned, of
   March 5th 1886, and apparently
   conflicting with the state-
   ment of Commander Armoux
   and Dumont at the be the exis-
   stence of said Treaty 
                        1833 and 1838</p>

<p> The glaring insconsistency 
   to have his chain of the French
   government is at once appa-
   rent on its force. The Indepen-
   ence of the Republic of
                        Liberia</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.007"/>

<p>Liberia was recognized by 
   France by Treaty in the past 
   1864. The State of Maryland
   in Liberia has acquired the
   territory now claimed by 
   France in 1846 or thereabouts,
   and was with all hher territo-
   ries, waters, debts and dues
   admitted as an integral
   pension of this Republic, in
   1867.</p>

<p> No obligations were raised
   by any European Power to
   the claim of the State of 
   Maryland in Liberia to
   these territories, neither was
   any objection made "to Liber-
   ria's assuming jurisdiction
   over these territories as a
   part of the state of Mary-
   land in Liberia when it
   was incorporated into the
   Republic of Liberia, which
   facts were made public
   to the world at the time.</p>

<p> Of it true that the
   French government obtain-
   ed from the Chiefs of govern</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.008"/>

<p>and Little Beriby cession
   of these territories in the
   year 1868, the cession was
   certainly invalidated by
   the <unclear/> titles of the
   Republic of Liberia to
   the territories and question.</p>

<p> Again the alleged claim
   of Francae to the said
   Territories if such exists,
   has never been published
   to the world, Liberia having
   been allowed, before during,
   and after the year 1868, to
   exercise undisputed control over
   the whole exact line
   from Cape Calmas to
   the San Pedro River.</p>

<p> Of this new doctrine of 
   France is permitted to
   obtain with respect to 
   Liberia, the existence of
   the Republic cannot be
   guaranteed for a single
   day, but is in great longer of being
   extinguished at any moment,
   by an Power having a desire
   for territorial agrandisement</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.009"/>

<p>on the Coast of the African con-
   tinent, and who might obtain
   seeds of cession dating long after
   those granted to the American
   Colonization Society and this govern-
   ment.</p>

<p> The Papers relation to the Cession
   of the Beriby territories to the State
   of Maryland in Liberia may be ob-
   tained of the Honorable John B.
   Lastrabr, President of the Ameri-
   can Colonization Society, Wash- 
   ington D.C. who was one of the 
   founders of the sate of Mary-
   land in Liberia.</p>

<p> In the despatches (copies en-
   closed from Consul General Carrance
   to President Johnson, referring
   to the recent correspondence
   between the French government
   and himslef relation to the-
   Armoux and Dumont affairs, M.
   de Fryermet seems to be extremely
   irritated at what he is pleased
   to term the interference of the
   United States in the Affairs
   of the independent State of</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.010"/>

<p>Liberia, and demands the right
   of the United States to interference
   in these Affairs. He goes so far
   as to assert that if these inter-
   ferences be continued, it will
   cause friendly relations be 
   broken off, not between France
   and the United States which
   he is pleased to term an "in-
   terferer," but with teh Republic
   of Liberia, the government of
   which has even studiously en-
   deavored to avoid giving grands
   of offence or complaint to the
   French government.</p>

<p> We recognize to right-of the
   United States to interfere in our
   affairs for the reasons assigned by
   you in your despatch No. 67, to
   Minister McIan Paris, of being
   "Liberia's next best friend."</p>

<p> France having no colonies
   or territories adjacent or
   contiguous to Liberia, and
   then being no commercial
   intercourse either way, no
   questions of boudnary, ill
   treatment of French citizens</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0200.011"/>

<p>or any other questions over
   at issue betwenn us.</p>

<p> You are doubtless aware
   that France has for many years
   been secretly endeavoring
   to gain a foothold or to active-
   ly intervene for the purpose
   of dismembering the Republic.</p>

<p> Between the years 1860-70,,
   under the Second Empire,
   an attempt was made to
   destroy the Republic, by laying
   claim to Grand Bassa, a point 
   some 50 or 60 miles south of 
   Monrovia. Also an alternate
   agreement originating with
   French government was
   made with another Power
   to dismember the Repub-
   lic, -one Power annexing
   down to Cape Mount on the
   North, the French from Cape
   Palmas southwards.</p>

<p>  There intention were frus-
   trated at that time by the
   Franco-German war.</p>

<p>   But France now finds it
    convenient to recommence</p>
