<p>No. 31. U.S. Consulate at Sierra Leone</p>

<p>Judson A. Lewis To Dept. State</p>

<p>Peace Meeting at Sierra Leone.
Settlement of the Quiah war and
signing articles of Peace.</p>

<pb n="532"/>

<note>No 31.</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate at
Sierra Leone Sept 30th 1880.</p>

<p>Hon. John Hay<lb/>
Ass't Secretary State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor
to report to the Department regarding
a great meeting between the Sierra Leone
Government and the Queens, Kings, 
and Chiefs of the Timneh Country
and their followers, held at Government
House on the 17th Instant,
to conclude and sign a Treaty of
Peace, which by the mediation of
some of them, His Excellency
the Administrator in Chief had
undertaken to effect among them
all, Chiefly for the settlement of
the Quiah War and also to secure
from future disturbance by
native wars, the territories adjacent
and forming the highway to
<catchwords>Sierra</catchwords>

<pb n="533"/>

Sierra Leone for the trade of the
interior.</p>

<p>A preliminary meeting had been
held at the Court Hall at which
the terms of the Treaty had been fully
discussed by the Chiefs among
themselves, so that the work of Friday
afternoon, consisted in the final
act of signing, after due explanation
of the terms of the Treaty
already agreed to.</p>

<p>The meeting at the Government House
which was held on the Eastern 
Lawn was attended by about
three hundred (300) Chiefs and followers.
His Excellency the Administrator-in chief
and Staff together with
Officers of the Regiment and invited
officials to the number of about
Seventy five (75) were in attendance
in uniform or full evening dress,
some of whose names appear
below as having witnessed the
ceremony of the signing of the
Treaty of Peace</p>

<pb n="534"/>

<p>The meeting which was one of the
largest of the kind <sic>every</sic> witnessed
in Sierra Leone, was very imposing. 
The Band of the 1st West India Regt.
was present, and a guard of honor
of about two hundred (200) troops
of the same Regiment, carrying their
colors, arms with fixed bayonets
were so placed upon the <unclear extent="one word"/>
<sic>esplanaid</sic> on the north side, <unclear>that</unclear> they
not only added effect to the scene
but must have impressed the
assembled chiefs, that with the
ready disposition of British power
to seek for and make peace, its capacity
for war was also unbounded.</p>

<p>The meeting having been <unclear>opened</unclear>
His Excellency the Administrator-in Chief
made to the Queens, Kings, Chiefs
and their followers an address which
was interpreted to them in the Timneh
language by Mr. T. G. Lawson,
Government Interpreter.</p>

<p>His Excellency in addressing them
said, that he had very little
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb n="535"/>

to say to them as he had already
had two interviews, with them and 
he had heard what they had said
in the Court Hall.</p>

<p>He had seen Lahie Bundoo and
Gbannah Sehrey shake hands
and had heard a universal desire
expressed for peace.</p>

<p>They had asked him to make an
agreement, which they should all 
sign before him, so as to peace on
record this desire. This he had
done and they had already had it read
and explained to them, and they said it
was the expression of their <del>desire</del> wish.
He said he had asked a great
many officers and gentlemen to be
present at the signing of this agreement
and if any of themselves
should forget what they signed that
day, they might be sure that he
and his officers and friends would
not do so.</p>

<p>He believed from what he had
heard from them, that they had not 
<catchwords>come</catchwords>

<pb n="536"/>

come for play, but were sincere
in their desire for peace; and if this
was so they and their children after
them would be glad they had signed 
that instrument, but it would be an
<unclear extent="one word"/> day for any one who made light
of it. They saw the soldiers that
were present, but the officer who
was sitting by him, had many more 
up the hill and at other places on
the coast. They had been to
Quiah: but he trusted they would
never go there again in that way.
The wish of the British was to see peace
and to teach the natives how to become
prosperous.</p>

<p>His Excellency asked Bey Mauro
King of the North Bullom, how many
people they met at Benkia, when 
he accompanied them there some
time ago, during the war, and
he replied none. he then asked
how many were there now, and 
he replied plenty, the country was
peopled again.</p>

<pb n="537"/>

<p>His Excellency said this was the
effect of Peace and that if they
continued peaceful, their country
would soon become rich, through
the security which their crop and
all their property would enjoy.
He expressed the hope, that he
would shortly have the pleasure
of seeing their people, again in
Sierra Leone not as now, to be
talking of war, or even to be making
peace, but to be trading 
together and enjoying the fruits
of the present peace, which he
trusted would be permanent.</p>

<p>At the request of His
Excellency the Colonial Secretary
read and Mr Lawson interpreted
the Treaty which is written below.
All the Chiefs having expressed
that they understood and agreed
to the terms thereof the Treaty was
signed and witnessed.</p>

<p>The following is the
Treaty</p>

<pb n="538"/>

<p>Treaty.</p>

<p>We the undersigned Queens, Kings
and Chiefs of our respective
countries, being met together
at Government House Sierra
Leone, desire to record and do
hereby mutually agree as follows:</p>

<p>Whereas wars have for some
time since been raging, in the Quiah
Country, whereby said country has
been impoverished, and the inhabitants
driven away: and
Whereas, such wars have been
mainly carried on by or at the
instigation of Gbannah Sehrey 
a chief under Bome Rufa and
Bome Warrah, Queens of the Quiah
Country in disobedience to the
command of such Queens:
and whereas Lahai Bundoo another
chief under the said Queens, has
also recently been engaged in war
with the said Gabannah Sehrey
whereby the Quiah Country has been
devastated: and whereas
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="539"/>

the said Gabannah Sehrey and
Lahai Bundoo, have expressed
their sincere regret, for their past
conduct, and the said Gbannah 
Sehrey has particularly <sic>inticated</sic> the
Administrator in Chief of the West
Africa Settlements to convey to her
Most Gracious Majesty Queen
Victoria his penitence for having
insulted His Excellency Sir Samuel
Rowe K.C.M.G. Governor in Chief</p>
