<p>Kenosha, Wis. May 13th, 1862</p>

<p>Hon W. H. Seward,<lb/>
Secretary of State,</p>

<p>Sir;</p>

<p>I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of the notice of
my appointment to the office of "Commercial
Agent of the United States, at 
Monrovia." Also a blank Bond to be
executed and returned. (no other enclosures)</p>

<p>I was born in England, but
am now a naturalized citizen of the
United States of America, and have
been appointed to officer from the State of
Wisconsin. Have not, at any time, 
resided in Liberia.</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose
my Bond, duly executed, with the certificate
of the District Attorney thereunto annexed.</p>

<pb n="Roll2-0044.jpg"/>

<p>I also enclose a certificate copy
of the certificate of my naturalization.</p>

<p>I beg leave to add that it is
my purpose to commence my journey
to the post assigned me, early in June,
and, unless a more direct &amp; expedition
mode of conveyance presents itself, to
sail by steamer to England, and
embark from thence by steamer, for
Liberia.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Dear Sir,<lb/>
Very Respectfully,<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant,<lb/>
Abm Hanson.</p>

<pb n="Roll2-0045.jpg"/>

<p>Certificate of Naturalization.</p>

<p>Be it Remembered, That at a Circuit Court, held at Milwaukee, for the
County of Milwaukee, in the State of Wisconsin, in the United States of
America, on the 30th day of January in the year of our
Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and <del>Fifty</del> Sixty two, Abraham
Hanson a native of England
exhibited a Petition praying to be admitted to become a Citizen of the United States,
and it appearing to the said Court that he had declared on Oath before the Circuit
Court for the County of Du Page State 
of Illinois on the 7 day of November
A. D. 1842, that it was bona-fide his intention to become a Citizen of the
United States, and to RENOUNCE FOREVER, all allegiance or fidelity to any
Foreign Prince, Potentate, State or Sovereignty whatsoever, and particularly to
Victoria Queen of Great Britain &amp; Ireland
of whom he was at that time a Subject and the said Abraham
Hanson having on his solemn Oath declared, and also made proof
thereof, by competent testimony of John W. Dunlap &amp; A. W. Kellogg
citizens of the United States, that he had resided one year and upwards in the State of Wisconsin,
and within the United States of America upwards of five years immediately preceding 
his application; and it appearing to the satisfaction of the Court that during that time he had
behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the
United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same; and having on his
solemn oath declared before the said Court that he would support the Constitution of the
United States, and that he did absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance
and fidelity to every Foreign Prince, Potentate, State and Sovereignty whatsoever, and 
particularly to Victoria Queen of Great Britain &amp; Ireland
of whom he was before a Subject.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Court admitted the said Abraham Hanson
to become a Citizen of the United States, and ordered all proceedings aforesaid to be recorded
by the Clerk of the said Court; and which was done accordingly.</p>
