<p>Legation of the United States of America
Entr: le 10 Janvier 1888
No d ordre 2644
CARTON 30 DOSSIER 8
Rép:le</p>
    
<p>Brussels January 9, 1888</p>
    
<p>Sir:</p>
    
<p>Under instructions from my Government, I have
the honor to invite your attention to the second article
of the decree of His Majesty, the Sovereign of the Independent
State of the Congo, on the subject of the use of flags
bearing date the 30th of April 1887, and published
in the Official Bulletin No 5 (May 1887).</p>
    
<p>As this article is understood, it decrees
that every private vessel navigating the waters
of the Independent State of the Congo, up the Stream
beyond the falls of Leopoldville, will be
required to hoist, at the Stern, the flag of 
the</p>
    
<p>To Mr. Edmund Van Ectvelde
General Administration of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>the State, and that if the repel <unclear></unclear>
Ships papers establishing the nationality.
She may, in addition, fly the flag of her country. </p>
    
<p>By the second article of the General act
pf the Berlin Conference, all flags without 
distinction of nationality, are secured in 
the night to have free access to all the waters
of the Congo and its a affluents, including
the lakes, and to all the canals that in the
future may be cur with the object of uniting
the watercourses or the lakes confined
in the whole extend of the territories described
in Article I. of that instrument, and while
the Government of the United States is not a 
party to that coursation, get the peaceful
use of the benefits offered by the Congo</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>Free State to the World at large, are shared
by their vessels and their citizens.</p>
    
<p>The Commerce of the Congo Free State 
being thus freely opened, the American vessel
viewed as vehicle of transit, may be either
a registered vessel of the Merchant
Marine of the United States or an
unregistered vessel owened by citizens of
the United States, without effecting, it is
insisted her enjoyment of this guaranteed
privilege of navigation. In either case, She has the 
right to fly the flag of the United 
States.</p>
    
<p>My Government hold it to be a 
settled principle of international law</p>
    
<pb></pb>

<p>that Ships not only are entitled to carry
wherever they go, the flag of the country
of which their owners are citizens, bu 
that it is their duty as a rule, to carry
such flag.</p>
    
<p>The principle stated however, would
be directly antagonized by a rule that
vessels navigating the rivers of a particular
State, when such rivers are open, as in
this case, to foreign navigation, should
carry the flag of that State.</p>
    
<p>This appears to the <unclear></unclear> of
article 2. of the royal decree of the
30th of April 1887.</p>
    
<p>Its effect is to substitute the flag</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>of the Congo Free State for the National
flag of the vessel by requiring the flag 
of the State to be displayed at the stern,
as it is evident that the flags of the <unclear></unclear>
nations could not both 
fly at the same staff. To do this
would be, under some circumstances
at least to denote that the vessel was
a prize to the nationality whose colors
were uppermost.</p>
    
<p>I understand it is the <unclear></unclear>
usage that the flag carried in a gaff
or at the flagstaff at the stern is the
flag of the vessels nationality.</p>
    
<p>The lase clause of Article 2. of</p>

<pb></pb>
    
<p>the decree of April 30th implies the
assetion of a righ on the part of the
authorities of the Congo State to determine
the sufficiency of the vessels' title to fly
her national flag, by making it depend
on the possession of papers establishing
her nationality.</p>
    
<p>It is maintained by my Government
that it is the province of each country
to determine for itself the conditions 
for the use of its flag upon its vessels, and
the United States rule is that vessels
bona fide owned by the citizens of the
United States, are entitled wen abroad, 
to carry the flag of the United States,
irrespective of the question of the</p>
    
<pb></pb>

<p>papers they may have on board.</p>
    
<p>I am therefore instructed by my Government 
to protest against the application of Article
2. of the royal decree of April 30, 1887 to
vessels owned by citizens of the United States:</p>
    
<p>1st In requiring such vessels to fly
the flag of the Independent State of the
Congo, at the stern. The right to require such 
vessels to hoist the flag of any other
nationality than their own is denied.</p>
    
<p>2nd In making the right to carry
a national flag on such vessels dependent
upon the possession of papers on board
establishing nationality.</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>I avail myself of the opportunity to renew
to you Sir, the assurances of my most
distinguished consideration.</p>
    
<p>Lambert Tree</p>
