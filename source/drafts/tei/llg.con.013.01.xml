<p>There are many of us in England who consider the crime which 
has been wrought in the <placeName key="con" n="mapped"><country type="colony">Congo lands</country></placeName> by King Leopold of Belgium
and his followers to be the greatest which has ever been known
in human annals. Personally I am strongly of that opinion.
There have been great expropriations like that of the Normans
in England or of the English in Ireland. There have been
massacres of populations like that of the South Americans by the
Spaniards or of subject nations by the Turks. But never before
has there been such a mixture of wholesale expropriation and
wholesale massacre all done under an odious guise of philanthropy
and with the lowest commercial motives as a reason. It is this
sordid cause and the uctious hypocrisy which makes this crime
unparalleled in its horror.</p>

<p>The witnesses of the crime are of all nations, and there is no possibility
of error concerning facts. There are British consuls like
Casement, Thesiger, Mitchell and Armstrong, all writing in their
official capacity with every detail of fact and date. There are Frenchmen
like Pierre Mille and Félicien Challaye, both of whom have
written books upon the subject. There are missionaries of many
races -- Harris, Weeks and Stannard (British); Morrison, Clarke
and Shepherd (American); Sjoblom (Swedish) and Father Vermeersch,
the Jesuit. There is the eloquent action of the Italian
Government, who refused to allow Italian officers to be employed
any longer in such hangman's work, and there is the report of the
Belgian commission, the evidence before which was suppressed
because it was too dreadful for publication; finally, there is the incorruptible
evidence of the kodak. Any American citizen who will
glance at Mark Twain's "King Leopold's Soliloquy" will see some
samples of that. A perusal of all of these sources of information 
will show that there is not a grotesque, obscene or ferocious torture
which human ingenuity could invent which has not been used against
these harmless and helpless people.</p>

<p>This would, to my mind, warrant our intervention in any case.
Turkey has several times been interfered with simply on the general
ground of humanity. There is in this instance a very special
reason why America and England should not stand by and see
these people done to death. They are, in a sense, their wards.
America was the first to give official recognition to King Leopold's
enterprise in 1884, and so has the responsibility of having actually
put him into that position which he has so dreadfully abused.
She has been the indirect and innocent cause of the whole tragedy.
Surely some reparation is due. On the other hand England
has, with the other European Powers, signed the treaty of 1885,
by which each and all of them make it responsible for the
condition of the native races. The other Powers have so far
shown no desire to live up to this pledge. But the conscience
of England is uneasy and she is slowly rousing herself to act.
Will America be behind?</p>

<p>At this moment two American citizens, Shepherd and that noble
Virginian, Morrison, are about to be tried at <placeName key="con.bom" n="mapped"><settlement type="city">Boma</settlement></placeName> for telling the
truth about the scoundrels. Morrison in the dock makes a finer
Statue of Liberty than Bartholdi's in New York harbour.</p>

<p>Attempts will be made in America (for the Congo has its paid
apologists everywhere) to pretend that England wants to oust Belgium
from her colony and take it herself. Such accusations are folly.
To run a tropical colony honestly without enslaving the natives is
an expensive process. For example <placeName key="nig" n="mapped"><country type="colony">Nigeria</country></placeName>, the nearest English
colony, has to be subsidized to the extent of $2,000,000 a year. Whoever
takes over the Congo will, considering its present demoralized
condition, have a certain expense of $10,000,000 a year for twenty
years. Belgium has not run the colony. It has simply sacked it,
forcing the inhabitants without pay to ship everything of value to
Antwerp. No decent European Power could do this. For many
years to come the Congo will be a heavy expense and it will truly
be a philanthropic call upon the next owner. I trust it will not fall
to England.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made too (for there is considerable ingenuity 
and unlimited money on the other side) to pretend that it is a question
of Protestant missions against Catholic. Anyone who thinks this
should read the book, "La Question Kongolaise," of the eloquent and
holy Jesuit, Father Vermeersch. He lived in the country and, as he
says, it was the sight of the" immeasurable misery," which drove him
to write.</p>

<p>We English who are earnest over this matter; look eagerly
to the westward to see some sign of moral support of material
leading. It would be a grand sight to see the banner of humanity
and civilization carried forward in such a cause by the two great
English-speaking nations.</p>
