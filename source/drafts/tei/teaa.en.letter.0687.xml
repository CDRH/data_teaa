Capt T.J. Burgess Statement

"This morning about 7 O'Clock while writing my letters for maid I heard a noise on deck,of some <unclear/> of row or fight, I proceeded to the deck at once. I saw Mr. Fordick the first-Officer, and one of the men gus Bennis denched and <unclear/> about on the deck: I took hold of Mr.Fordick and pulled him off from this man, and told that, was quite enough, I did not allow any such work, and they must stop it at once; while in the act of seperating the parties, the rest of the crew came after, armed with the windlass normon and knives. One of the men named Gus Carlisle struck me in the head with the windlass normon, and once on the shoulder, and was in the act of doing it again when the normon was taken out his hand by the second officer of the ship. As soon as I come to my senses from the effects of the blow, I proceeded to the cabin, and from <unclear/> to the deck bein nearly blind from the effects of the blow, I had received. As I proceeded to the deck I met the 1st Officer coming down bleedng very badly from blows and stabs. After I got to the deck i found things quiet with the exception, that the men said they would do no more work while on board the ship. I at once sent the st Officer to the Doctor for medical attendance.

One of the men Gus Carlisle made the remark "If he came back again that he would fix him good. I sent the men to breakfast. After breakfast I went to turn them to their work. They refused to work. i then asked them one by one if they were willing to work? Their answer was "No! and wanted to <unclear/> what I was going to do wth them." I told them I had nothing to say, and proceeded at nce to the American Consul for protection."
