Sir,

<p>There is, and 
long has been, an active trade in Slaves, amounting 
to several hundreds a year, I can not give 
exact figures, Carried on between Princes and 
St. Shome, (Portuguese islands 150 miles west 
of Gaboon) and Gaboon + Coast South.
Last year I coasted as far as 2^o60 South. On
the way I saw a schoner of about 100 tons 
burden, which had been boarded by the agent 
of an English factory the day before, and found 
to be "full of slaves" I also saw a boat, capable 
of carrying 30 or 40 persons, but *darkup
prevented our disting* wishing what is contained.
On a porvised voyage our vessel sae 
three such slave-boats. We have children 
in our school taken from such boats, and 
given to are Mission to be free and educated.
At Cape Lopez I beamers there were 
two slave factories (on which I saw) when 

slaves

Slaves were carried to the islands in boats 
and larger Canoes.
<pb facs="20170615_111946"

<p>During the present voyage I heard 
of a slavefactory in Pernan vas river of 
another large me at Cape Lopez + I saw 
at the latter place a schooner at anchor 
in the of*ing.

<p></p>I had with me a son of the late Ring 
of Cape Lopez, who was very Communicative 
on the subject of the Slave trade. The 
Burew all about the movements of the schooner which 
I saw at anchor. He said she seldom carried -
slaves; in engage in taking corgors of goods 
to the factories, + small return conquers of farina 
; it has a bundle of certificate of good 
characters receimd* Eng. Cruisers; is owned at 
Process; is recognized at Gaboon as a lawful trade H.R.

This is no doubt the same schooner I saw 
last year a little further South.

<p>A few months ago a Porteguese schooner from St.
Paul de Loaude, bound for Princes or St. Thome put 
into Gaboon leaking very badly. It had a great 
many blacks aboard, servants to the officers +crew of
the schooner, for whom regular passports had been 
made out at St. P de L.J learned that each 
citizen may taken 10 such servants according 

to
<pb facs="20170615_111951"
to Porteguese law.

<p></p>The question arises, What becomes of all 
these slaves?  Wiener the Cash and Merchandise 
that pay for them? Agriculture on these islands
is at a very low 266. Only small grantitues of Offcie
+ beacon are raised for exportation and nothingelse.
So Rind of manufactures is carried .
<p></p>Hence then the demand for so many slaves?
Are they reshipped to and then market? This would 
seem profitable. An American supercargo, an 
acquitable of mine, was total, when there a few
years ago that they counted furnish him with 200
slaves in ten days time. The schooner in which 
I coasted South last year, was at the islands a short 
time before, when the Capt. saw there a brig, with hatches
down and no apperance of trade day after 
down and no apperance of trade day after day.
When her Capt. was questioned about his trade his 
answer were very evasive. At the same time the 
<p></p>Porteguese schooners above mentioned "was about 
at Cape Lopez, for a cargo of Pea mets"
Our captain has no doubt the brig was there 
for a vargo of Slaves. I have heard of there 
being no slaves on the island, but heard nothing 
of any epidemic that swept them off.

The
<pb facs="20170615_112003"
<p>The French claim Cape Lopez as well as Gaboon,
yet slave trading carried on at both places almost 
continually. There is now a trader om Gaboon, but 
probably not known to the Authorities. Occasionally the 
Authorities here make some effort to stop it, and I 
have, once, in the last 5 years, taken a count and slaves .
They freed the slaves + released the traders.

<ab>Such is about the sums of informaiton 
I have. I have communicated it, unofficially of course,
to the British Consul of Fermando Po.

I am Sir your obident Servant 
J.M.Preston
