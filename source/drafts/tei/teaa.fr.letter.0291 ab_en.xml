<p>Consulate General
of the Independent State of the Congo. 
Baltimore.</p>

<p>Sir Knight-</p>

<p>It gives me pleasure to announce to you that 
Mr. Senator Aldrich started to take a 
special interest in the Congo. During last year he 
showed himself to be rather benevolent and, from time to time, he performed
friendly services for us. Most recently I began the 
discussion of rubber with him and he was interested in it
a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. Aldrich and his son-in-law Rockefeller (son) are 
the heads of a small but very powerful group taking 
a great interesst in rubber. Recently they organized 
a company of 30 million dollar to run 
the Mexian and South American rubber. Next what
they told me is that it's likley that they will want to be interested 
in the rubber from the Conge in some way.</p>

<p>Mr. Alrich descovered a new manner by 
which one can, to your advantage, extract some good rubber 
from the bad herbs or tropical plants that only 
contain one small part of rubber- that, in effect,
only contain ten percent of rubber over 
90 for 100 of useless material. </p>

<p>They've made experiments for five years and, finally,
they found a method that isn't expensive. They have already
worked on Mexican plants and they tell me that they
can produce an enormous quanity of four tons a day.</p>

<p>The Senator Aldrich spoke to me about the four tons a day.
To work his process in the Congo and I have written to Mr. 
Major Liebrecht in asking him some exact
details on the plants from the Congo.</p>

<p>It's possible that we have a herb or one in the Congo</p>

<p>Sir Knight of the Cuvelier
Brussels.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>Consulate General 
of
the Independent State of the Congo.
Baltimore.</p>

<p>any plant- even a plant that only contains 
10 percent of rubber- that respond to the goal.</p>

<p>If one can extract the Congolese herbs from the rubber 
that up until the present are rested fruitless here a 
good business for the Congo from the commercial point of view.</p>

<p>In any case- if the process suceeds in the Congo or not- 
the keen interest from the Senator Aldrich and Mr. Rockefeller
in this subject is a good business for the Congo in a political
point of view, and it's on this phase of the issue that 
I want to specially draw your attention.</p>

<p>The Senator Aldrich is very rich, interested in a 
number of monopolies, and he is very powerful int he Senate. He is
"Republican", and is called "The Boss of the Senate".</p>

<p>Rockefeller is, as you know, the very rich sone of 
Rockefeller form the "Standard Oil Company", and the son-in-law of Mr. 
Aldrich. He is young, serious- too serious- and 
a "Baptist qui semble prendre un vif interêt aux affaires
religeuses. He was in the ranks of our adversaries, 
and I can tell you in confidence that, last year, he tried
to win the sympathies of Senator Aldrich for the
anti-Congolese Baptist missionaries without 
sucess.</p>

<p>If Senator Aldrich and group want to interest themselves
in rubber in the Congo, in any way, the willingness 
of His Majesty will be very useful for them. Mr. Aldrich 
knows it well and this fact will not make it less friendly in the Congo.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Rockefeller this fact will give him, maybe,
a new perspective and a new manner of thinking.</p>

<p>You will recognize the importance of watching this affaire 
as confidential for the moment.</p>

<p>I'm writing to Mr. Major Liebrechts today, and, 
naturally I talked about the subject to Mr. Baron Moncheur
also confidetially.</p>

<p>Please accept, Sir Knight, the assurance of 
my best sentiments.</p>

<p>James Gustavus Whiteley</p>
