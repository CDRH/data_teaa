<p>Department of State
   Monrovia, October3, 1864</p>

<p>Sir,
        In consequence of-
   certain dangers with-
   which this Republic is
   suddenly threatened by
   the recent stranding of
   our only naval vessel and
   quard costa, the "Quail"
   and the probablity of
   our coast beignm, for a-
   long time, in an exposed
   and defenceless conditions</p>

<p>Hon. W.H. Seward
        Secretary of State
          Washington D.C.</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.002.jpg"/>

<p>I am directed by the-
   President to make-
   application through
   you to the government
   of the United States
   for a small revenue-
   cutter or gun-boat
   for which this Republic
   will stipulate to pay-
   after a turn of years to-
   be agreed upon by the
   Chargè d'Affaires of
   Liberia in the United-
   States, and whomsoever
   the United States-
   government may appoint
   as its agents to negotiate
   on its behalf
                    Among</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.003.jpg"/>

<p>Among the dangers to be-
   apprehended are, 1st the-
   invasion of our feeble-
   settlements on the coast-
   at a distance from the 
   capital by predatory tribes
   who taking advantage
   of the emergency the-
   absence of a suitable-
   vessel to throw forces-
   readily among them-
   would seek the slightest
   pretext for plundering the
   settlements.</p>

<p> Owing ton the influence
   destructive of the slave-
   trade, which this-
   Republic has exercised,
                      not</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.004.jpg"/>

<p>not a few of the older-
   aborigines who formerly-
   enriched themselves by-
   the nefarious traffic
   entertain bitter and
   resentful feelings against
   Liberia, which, whenever there
   is the least opportunity,
   they never fail to-
   manifest. The younger
   natives, I am happy to-
   perceive the superior-
   advantages of lawful
   commerce over the slave-
   trade, and we may
   hope that are long not
   only the overt practice
   but every feeling favorable
                           to-</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.005.jpg"/>

<p>to it will be completely
   annihilated within our-
   borders.</p>

<p>2 From what I have-
   just said, it may be-
   readily inferred that-
   another danger to the-
   Republic likely to result
   from the absence of a-
   guarda costa would be
   the revival of the slave-
   trade in isolated-
   localities. Those sections
   of country would again
   be the scene of the-
   horrible barbarities and
   cruelties of former years,
   and a deplorable check
                    would</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.006.jpg"/>

<p>would be imposed-
   upon the growing-
   agriculture and-
   commerce of the country.</p>

<p>3 The third and last-
   danger, which I shall 
   mention, to be apprehended
   by us from the naval-
   deficiency in question
   would be the constant-
   infraction of our-
   revenue laws by certain
   European traders;-
   especially as there will 
   likely go into operation
   on the 1st of January-
   1865, our new law-
   confirming all foreign
   vessels to the legally-
   constituted "ports of entry"
                           Many</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.007.jpg"/>

<p>Many of the European-
   traders seem opposed to-
   this law, not because it is
   not just and equitable,
   but because they think-
   that their traffic hereafter-
   will not be so lucrative as
   it has been; and, through
   their influence, by-
   clandestine visits to-
   native tribes on the coast;
   they would be able to excite
   and aid them to acts of
   hostility against the-
   governments.</p>

<p> The government of-
   Liberia has never before
   felt at liberty to make 
   application, in emergencies,</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.008.jpg"/>

<p>to the government of the-
   United States. BUt such
   has been the vivid and-
   courteous treatment of-
   the present governments
   Liberia, that we feel-
   emboldened to take this
   step-assured that we-
   have your ardent-
   sympathy in our efforts
   to build up andmaintain
   an independent-
   Afric-American-
   nationality on this-
   continent.</p>

<p>  The President and
   people of Liberia have
   observed with emotions of
   sincere pleasure the-
   enlightened patriotism
                    and</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.009.jpg"/>

<p>and exalted philanthropy
   which, since the breaking
   out of the unhappy context,
   have influenced the councils
   of the American nation.
   Among the decisions of-
   that govenrments which-
   Liberia and every negro-
   community must hail
   with the most unfounded
   applause, are first, the-
   decision that slavery shall 
   not hence forth be extended
   under the American flag
   over territories now free;-
   secondly, that the African
   slave trade shall never be 
   revivied or renewed; thirdly,
   that slavery shall be-
   forever abolished within the
   federal District of Columbia
                         fourthly</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.010.jpg"/>

<p>fourthly, that slaves-
   escaping or captured-
   from disloyal masters-
   shall not be restored to-
   slavery but shall be free.</p>

<p>These and numerous other
   equally liberal acts fortify
   us in the belief that the-
   United States government
   will not fail to accord us
   any assistance in its-
   power in view of the imminent
   emergencies to which I have
   referred.</p>

<p> In closing this-
   communication, I beg to-
   express the hop ethat the
   lamentable civil war
   now distracting your
   lately prosperous and
   happy country, may be 
                  brought</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0181.011.jpg"/>

<p>brought to a speedy-
   termination, consisting-
   with the honor and dignity-
   of the United tates, conducive-
   to the welfare and happiness 
   of all the inhabitants of that-
   great country, and promotive
   of the cause of civil liberty
   throughout the world.</p>

<p>     I have the honor to be,
   with the highset consideration, 
   Sir, your most obedient-
   humble servant
            Edward M. Blyden</p>
