<p>Mr. President
As the first representatives of the 
Island of Madagascar who have visited this great
Republic; we feel ourselves honored in this meeting
at its capital with yourself its distinguished
leader.</p>
    
<p>We have only been a very few days in this country,
but we have already begun to be conscious of a warm
desire on the part of the American people for our 
kingdom's welfare, and we hope that our visit will
tend to deepen that kindly feeling in the hearts
of all your citizens the foremost lovers of National 
independence.</p>
    
<p>Commerce between this your country and our
own distant island has increased of late to 
such an extent as to have demanded the attention
of both our Governments. This progress is in no
ssmall measure due to the efforts of your excellent
representative there, Colonel Robinson, whom we have 
learned to respect as few other foreigners are expected.
In the name of our Queen we desire to hear this
testimony to this wisdom and ability.</p>
    
<p>Our business today as Ambassadors of Her
Majesty the Queen of Madagascar is to present
the credentials which we were hidden to lay
before you. We have also been made <unclear/>
by your Queen of a few articles of 
<unclear/> workmanship which she desired.

you</p>

<pb facs="20170614_154119"/>
    
<p>you to accept not as things of value in themselves
but as tokens of friendly respect.</p>   
    
<p>Lastly, Mr. President we desire to thank you
for a most hospitable welcome to America, and
beg you now to consider us as being at the 
disposal of Your Government for the considerate
of those affairs which are included in our
commission.</p>
