<p>On the 7th inst. I received an <unclear>invitation</unclear>
from one of the Chief Justices of the
City to assist, as witness, the sealing
up of the Brazilian Consular Archives
in few hours after the death of the
Acting Brazilian Consul of this City. I
found the Judge with two Brazilian
Gentlemen perusing and commenting upon
the Brazilian Consular Regulations. My
attention was called to an article of the
Regulations wherein it was written
that whenever a Brazilian Consul

should die, it was requested of the
competent Authority to cull together two
Brazilian subjects and a Consul of some
friendly nation, to witness the sealing
up of the Archives and to invite said
Consular Officer to take charge of
the duties of the Brazilian Consulate
until His Imperial Majesty should
be pleased to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>I considered it my duty
under the circumstances to cheerfully
accept the duty thus assigned to me
and in my Despatch to His Excellency
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil
copy of which I herewith enclose; I
say to His Excellency that I am
moved with pride as the Representative
of the United States in this country to

have it in my power to be of service
to this friendly Empire of Brazil.
I also addressed His Excellency the
Governor General of the Province on
the subject copy of which I have
also the honor to enclose.</p>

<p>I am confident the Department
will approve of my proceedings
in this case founded as I
suppose they are, upon the correct
principle of International Courtesy.</p>
