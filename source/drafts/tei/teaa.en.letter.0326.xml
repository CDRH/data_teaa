form San Lark are Liverpool, England the 
last of this month.
I shall be very sad I receive any 
special instructions from you addressed
to 23 Centre JL.N.Y. or I will go to 
Nashington if necessary.

The situation there as of appears 
me and out fellow missionary seemed
to warrent French aggression and 
occasion of territory and I firmly believe 
that they will not be content without 
the Congo country is under there authority 
for we of this t have felt 
this to myself be most of *unclear*

to and to Gaboon one 
goes his while attention of this 
and ehite in this emmity have 
on the land and for sords one 
I could recommend Africa weeks 
ago I met a young man when I 
formerly knew in college a young 
man of sterling Christian Character 
and marked ability who a pressed 
himself as willing to spend a few 
years there. I  therefore recommend 
Royal F. King, nephew of Hon. Worm 
King of Minnesota, either for the 
petition with which you have honored 
which I will glady resign a 
accept the vice commercial agency 
or to any other position you might 
see full to appoint him. He has 
seen some service under the Department 
of the Indian among the Indians 
where the temptations + young 
are similar to them on the coast,
and I there Lore Commandant his 


    

United States 
Commercial Agent

Mr, Busnell 
To the Department 
of State 

Subject,
Visit of United States 
Steamer Essex 
at Gaboon

Sir, 

I have the honor to inform you that we
have recently received a visit at this 
port, from the United States Steamers 
Essex Commander W.L.Sehley she 
remained a such during which 
time we enjoyed the plesant society 
of Commander Schlet and hiis 
gentlemanly offices from whom we 
received my kind and courteous 
attentions. Permit me to make
honorable mention of the French 
Commandant Crpt. J. Borton
who simply furnished Commandert 
Schley first all neefull supplies 
to ,ale him to continue his 
voyage to the Congo and 


So Paul de Lundo. The visit 
of this beautiful ship, with her 
truly Patriotu gentlemanly 
Commander and offices, will 
promoite American interest in this 
part of Africa; and I trust in 
future, we may more frequently  
recieve visity from our national 
vessels than we have done since 
the late war.

I beg to remain 
Sir;
