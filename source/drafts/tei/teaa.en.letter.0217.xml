1039 Lambard Street 
Philadelphia, Pa
November 20th 1890.

Honorable James G. Blaine 
Secretary of State
Washington D.C.

Sir,

In the short interview with which 
you honored me, on Friday last, I 
informed you that I was commissioned
by the President of Liberia to approach 
your Government, with the hope that 
you would be induced to make 
such a demonstration in our favor 
as will prevent foreign nations from 
making encroachments* on our territory.

Unfortunately for me the pressure 
of business did not permit of your 
giving me time to lay before you the 
facts, and you tell me to call again 
the next day, which I did, and I called 
again on the following Monday and 
Tuesday but with no better success
awing to the *frat pressure of business 
in your office.

As I had to leave your city and on 

Tuesday 

Tuesday last, I make bold to adopt 
this method of laying the matter before 
you, trusting that you will be kind enough 
to give it you consideration.

In the year 1885 a French Man of
war came into the harbor of our Capital,
Mourview*, and the Commander called upon
the President. During the conversation
the Commander said that he had stopped 
at Beoiby*- a place within our boundray
line- and had an interview with the 
chiefs. The President asked, "Why did 
you stop them and have that interview,
do you not know that territory belongs to 
Liberia"! The Commander replied that
he did not know that it belonged to 
Liberia, and that he has been instemeted*
by his government to stop them and ban 
that interview.

After the department of the resvel*
the President instmeted our Representative 
in Paris to call the attentionof 
this officer, and to point out the fact 
that our boundray on the South East **terided
to the san Pedro River, as you
will see by referring to the "Imperial Atlas"
in your office, and that they had 
ritually admitted it by their Naval
Charts and otherwise*

The French Government then claimed
that they had Commercial 
Treaties with the chief of Beniby*
as old as 1846, I think, but we have 
seeds* of Cossive of that Territory 
made to us as far back as 1836 or 1837.

We laid this matter before your
government and asked for your 
kind offices; and in a despatch 
to Mr. McLorne, dated Janurary 13th, 1886
Mr. Boyard instmeted him to 
interview, and to say to the French 
Government. "We excerise no protertorate
over Liberia, but the circumstances that that
Republic originated through thr colonization of 
American citizens, and was established 
under the fastering caneton**
of this government, gives us the
right, as the next friend of 
Liberia, to aid her in preventing any
encrroachments* of Foreign powers 
on her territorial soverengnity, and 
in settling any dispute that may 

arise

arise. The Southeasternly boundary
at the River San Pedro has never been 
questioned and has the powerful sanctions
of general admission for many years". 

This matter has remained in obyeance 
as ever auppar*-oince that time; but if 
lately came to our knowledge that one 
Captain Bingen, who was a pominent 
officer in the late expedition against 
the King of Dahomey, claims to have 
made expllorations in the near and 
Southeast of Liberia; and he has published
in a "Suppliment and Journal Le 
Temps, Mans 1890", a map representing 
Liberia on a very narrow strip along the 
Coast and representing the Country in the
immediate near of Liberia, as fas as 
Musada**, as unexplored country, and 
liable to become a Proletorate* of France 
although our Mr. Beny Anderson had 
explored that country as far as Musadu**
and published an account of his
journey- and cutting off our territory 
on the Southeast up to the Cavalla River,
thus taking the very territory in 
dispute and which Mr. Boyard 

belongs

belongs to u by "The powerful sanction* 
of general admission for many years".
The territory so taken from us is 
represented on his Map as French 
territory.

Whilst the French have not, as 
yet made any open movement towards
taking possession of our 
territories, yt. Mr. Secretary, under 
these circumstances we feel warrants
in appealing to your government 
as "Liberia's next Friend"
and asking you to make such a 
demonstration in our favor as
will prevent Foreign government 
from making such encroachment* 
on our territory. If your powerful
government would make a present 
of one o your smallest stream form
boats to be used in boarding* our
Coast from foreigners and preventing 
them from settling at points remote 
from our civilized settlements, and 
tampering with the aboriginals, we 
feel that over territorial limits will 
not be encroached* uproar.

My Secretary my Government 
believes that if you will be followed
to give us the benefit of your kind 
office, and will *induce This Excellency, 
the President to recommend 
the giving of this resent* to Liberia 
we of all be successful; and the very 
recommencer nation by the President will
indicate to the world the friendship 
of the United States for our Little Republic.

Trusting, Mr Secretary that 
you will bring this matter to the 
notice of his Excellency, the President,
and that
