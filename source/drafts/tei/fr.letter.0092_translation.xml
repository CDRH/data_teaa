<p>
Mister,

By a letter dated from Washingon, the
20th of last month, I informed you
that as soon as the necessary documents (that were
sent to me <del>at this same time</del> <add>then</add> from Boston) are sent
to me, I will supply you with the explanations that you
demanded from me by your letter from the 19th of last
month, on the subject of the refusal made by the corvette
of the Union l'Yorktown, to salute the fort
of Aumale belonging to the French. These papers
are now between my hands, and I may, according to
the report of the Commander Bell and the correspondance
to which his refusal of salute gave
place, transmit to you the following details.
It appears that, on november 14th 1845, this officer
entered in the river of gabon (Africa) with
the corvette of the Union, l'yorktown, under its
orders. In going back up the river, he passed in front of
a little blockhouse lifted on the bank by the
French at 3<del>7</del> hours <add>1/2 in</add> the afternoon, he threw
the anchor near the village of the king Glass, at 4 miles
around <unclear>sus-dit</unclear> blockhouse. The next day at
8 hours in the morning, an officer of the french war
brig "the Malouisse," came aboard to present to him
</p>

compliments of the commander <unclear>he returns</unclear> in
<unclear/> time a note from the commander <unclear/>
when the officers retired themselves, this last
<unclear/> it was a letter of the officer knowing
the blockhouse, however his of that which
Commander Bell had passed in front of the
<unclear/> without saluer, <unclear/> where, then, he asked officially
the <unclear/> for the french flag.
Commander Bell holds no <unclear/>
of this demand <unclear/> It <unclear/> an
officer aboard the Malouine to render the
<unclear/> of usage and to pray at the same time the
commander of this brig to charge himself
with a letter addressed to the commanding officer the
french forces of the station, demands to that which
one <unclear/> this instant. The following day, the commander <!-- 'commandant' is hyphenated between 'comman' and 'dant' -->
Bell sent his letter aboard the commander <!-- 'commandant' is hyphenated between 'comman-' and 'dant' -->
of which the Malouïne refused to <supplied>receive</supplied>
unless Commander Bel <supplied>salutes</supplied>
or gives appropriate explanations
He informed by writing to commander <supplied>Bell</supplied>
this determination on his part. The two <supplied>propositions</supplied>
were rejected after having taken provisions <supplied>l'yorktown</supplied> <!-- 'yorktown' is hyphenated between 'york' and 'town' -->
continues its voyage.
</p>

<p>
If commander Bell is reprehensible <!-- 'repréhensible' is hyphenated between 'repré-' and 'hensible' -->
for not having sent to the fort a
proposition of exchange of salutes, the same day of <supplied>his</supplied>
arrival, the french commanding officer committed <!-- 'commis' is hyphenated between 'com' and 'mis' -->
a bigger error in demanding
as a right that which is considered as
</p>

<p>
an act of courtesy, and accorded by the usage to the
flags of the powerful friends, <add>in entering their territories</add> after being previously <!-- 'préalablement' is hyphenated between 'préa-' and 'lablement' -->
heard with the authorities so that one
fights back with their canon.
The French had right to this act of courtesy
in gabon. I regret what happened, especially
because the French are very susceptible to this
subjet and specially in gabon. There in effect,
after the handover of the country, the indigenous made an
effort to <del>reject</del> <add><unclear/></add> their authority, and the French
believe that they were supported in this <supplied>movement</supplied>
par les american mission vessels. A similar
fact already produced itself with the <unclear/>. <supplied>I</supplied>
beleived my duty, in this circumstance, to <supplied>blame</supplied>
the conduct of the american commander. I
tansmit in the time a report on this
affair to the minister

Secretary of the navy, in Washington.
