Sir,
It is my painful duty to inform you that the late W Hogan Esq, United States Consul for this place died in England last month, I cannot give you the exact date, the particulars not having as yet come to hand.

Mr. Hogan left this on August 13th last, since which time I have had the honor of representing him, I having been gaztted by our Colonial Government, at his request, as Acting United States Consul. 

Expecting his return before this, I have simply followed his instructions with regard to the American vessels, which have arrived at, and departed from this place Keeping all accounts for his inspection, previous to his forwarding them to you. 

I shall consider myself honored by receiving instructions, as to my future proceedings

The Honble J.B.B. Davis

proceedings, at the same time I shall be only too happy to continue my Consular duties as before.

There being no resident American Merchant here, I am in hopes that you will think fit to allow one to do so, in which case, I will at all time do my interest to protect the interests of those I shall represent, and the experience I have gained during a twenty years stay on the Coast will greatly assist me in so doing.

I have the honor to be
Sir
Your obeient Servant
Hath Ryan
Acting U.S. Consul
