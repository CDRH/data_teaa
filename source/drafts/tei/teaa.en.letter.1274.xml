<p>No. 36, Consular Series.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia;
Oct. 3, 1899.</p>

<p>Hon. Thos. W. Cridler,
Third Assistant Secretary,
of State. Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt
Sept. 27, of your No. 22,
"Consular," of Aug. 26, 1899.
You desire an expression
from me relative to the
retention or discontinuation
of the Cape Coast
Castle Consulor Agency.
In making such an
expression, I have to
say, that whereas the late
George E. Eminsang Esq.,
the late Consular Agent,
died April 17, 1898; before
I assued the responsibilities
of</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3066.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>of this Consulate General. I
have not been in official
correspondence with said
Agency; and therefore, feel
very reluctant to advise,
in the matter.</p>

<p>While at said Agency,
in Gebruary last, I was
impressed, by the businessmen
and others of reputation,
of Elmina and Cape
Coast Castle, to believe
that it was all important
that said Agency
should be retained.
Having no knowledge
of the volume of business
transmitted between the
United States and the
Gold Coast Colony. I
used every possible
means to obtain as full
a report of the Commercial
statistics, as possible, and
transmitted same to
the</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3067.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>the Department, as a basis
upon which it could
make up its conclusions,
relative to the retention or
discontinuation of said
Consular Agency.</p>

<p>Since writing my No.
33, "Consular," of Aug. 1,
1899, I have heard from
Fynn Egyr Asaam Esq.,
who seems to have so
far recovered his health
as to think himself able to
discharge the responsibilities
of said Consular Agency,
if appointed. I have, therefore,
this day, forwarded to
him, for execution and
return to this Consulate
General, a blank copy of
"Application for Office."
Form No. 205.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be your
obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith; M. R.
&amp; C. General.</p>
