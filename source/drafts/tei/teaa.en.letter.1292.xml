<p>No. 52. Consular.
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia Liberia,
Nov. 6 1900.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
Referring to my No. 51,
"Consulor," Octo. 26, 1900. I
have the honor to say that:
carefully searching the records
and files of this Legation, touching
the correspondence between
this Legation, the State and
other Departments, of the Liberian
Government, and other
individuals in this country
and the United States, relative
the estate of the late
<unclear>Anranus</unclear> M. Miller, deceased,
late of Harper, (Cape Palmas)
Liberia; I have found the
originals, of which copies
are</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3128.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>are, herewith, inclosed.</p>

<p>In note No. 1. Oct. 31, 1892,
of Wm. D. McKoy Esq. to E.
Warneke, giving number
of Treasury Orders &amp;c., you will
take notice that the apparently
erased No. 75 (No. 74) written
in red ink is a faithful
copy of the Record, whatever
it may represent.</p>

<p>2. I regret to say we find
no record of Note of Wm. D.
McKoy Esq., rewritting the $50
order, acknowledged having
been received by Hon. H. A. 
Williams, Secretary of
Treasury, in his note of January
4, 1893, as per inclosed copy.</p>

<p>We, however, are inclined
to believe that the $50.-- One
General Government Order
No. 40, undoubtedly added
after the fooling up of the several
Treasury Orders, amounting
to $1001.75; is the $50. order of
the</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3129.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>the Hon. H. A. Williams, Secretary
of the Treasury Jan. 4, 1893,
(as per inclosed copy), which
appears to have been added to
the original sum. Note No. 1 of
Oct. 31, 1892. See note of
Wm. D. McKoy Esq., of March
25, 1893 to Mrs. A. M. Miller
Newcastle, ME, in which he,
undoubtedly, refers to the
$50. Treasury Order, of the Hon.
H. A> Williams, Secretary of
the Treasury. Jan. 4, 1893.</p>

<p>We find no record of
any correspondence, touching
this case, between Wm. H. Heard
Esq., and any other party, excepting a receipt from F. O. 
Thorn, for $456.59, in Treasury 
Order- Jan. 1898.</p>

<p>3. I inclose, herewith, a correct
copy of the Act of the Liberian
Legislature session 1893-4, referred
to by Hon. H. A. Williams,
Secretary of the Treasury, in his
Note</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Note, of February 22, 1894 to Vice
Consul General B. Y. Payne.</p>

<p>Hoping the foregoing may
be of some service, as well as
information, relative to this can
and thinking it very advisable
that F. O. Thorn Esq., who is
the senior senator from
Maryland county, be required to
turn over the Treasury Order
for $456.59, (in his possession)
to this Legation, for collection, if
possible.</p>

up by the Department for
currency on account of the next
accumulation of this money.
Payment otherwise than by
this</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3134.jpg"/>

<p>Dear Sir:
Receiving to our interview
in reference to the claim
of the Estate of Mr. A. M. Miller
against your Government,
I beg to say, I have in my
possession $598.15, in Maryland

be glad, if you can settle these
or advise me what course to
pursue to cause an early
settlement of same, as his
widow is very much in need
of the money.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,

<p>Madame,
I am in receipt of your favor
of the 11th ult., inclosing ($15.00) Fifteen
dollars in Liberian Currency and
soliciting my services in settling
your late husband's estate.</p>

<p>I beg to say that your Liberian Government fills are in my
possession, and will have
my attention as soon as the
affairs at Cape Palmas (in here
they are payable) will warrant.
I shall sell the Liberian Currency
($15.00) for what it will
bring in the market, and
remit you at an early date.</p>

<p>Legation of the U.S.A.
Monrovia, Liberia, April 24, 1893.</p>

<p>Honorable G. W. Gibson,
Secretary of State,
Monrovia, Liberia.</p>

<p>Sir:
As I shall probably leave
this post at no distant day
it becomes my duty to make
a report upon all unfinished
business, and this in time
that my Government may
further instruct me before I
take my departure in case
further instruction be necessary.
In accordance herewtih
I respectfully ask a report
upon each of the following
subjects numbered 1, 2 and 3:-</p>

<p>1. The Treasury claims
against Maryland County,
belonging to the Estate of Capt.
A. M. Miller, deceased.</p>

<p>See my communication No. 19
leaing date, Dec. 5, 1892.)
(over)</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3138.jpg"/>

<p>2. The destruction of the Baptist
Vic Mission at Bendon. There
is hardly a probability of any
more goods being uncovered
and it seems to me all that
is necessary now is for your
Government to determine the
responsibility encumbent
upon it, on that it will
assume.</p>

<p>3. Whether or not our
Government may expect
a reduction in Postal Rates
between Liberia and the
United States, and if so, where?
If not, why?</p>

<p>Hoping that these subjects
shall receive your earliest
attention, I have the honor
to be, Sir,--</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,
William D. McCoy,
U.S. Minister Resident and
Consul General.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. M. Miller,

<p>Madame:-
Affairs at Cape Palmas
are in such an unsettled
condition, that it is impossible
to tell when the Treasurer
will be able to cash those
orders belonging to the Estate of
your deceased husband. I have
than on hand and shall do
what is possible to get them
cashed before I leave this
post. In case I am not
successful I shall turn the Orders
over to my successor, take his
respect for the same and forward
a copy of the receipt to
you.</p>

<p>I have collected one
Government order of $50.00 2/3
being</p>

<pb n="Roll6-3142.jpg"/>

<p>being paid in current money
and 1/3 in Liberian currency.
The law authorizes such
payment although the currency
is almost worthless.
I am obliged to send it to
you for I cannot dispose of
it. Occasionally one can
get 50¢ on a dollar for it
but it is seldom that there
is any demand for it at all.</p>

<p>Please acknowledge the
receipt of this directing your

If I shall have left Monrovia
it will be kept there for me.</p>
