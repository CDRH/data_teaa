<p>failed to move the Soba he told him, we had committed
crimes in our country, and he had been sent by the
Governor of Benguella, to drive us out and if the Soba
should refuse to send us away he would get
himself and his country into trouble.</p>

<p>At the same time Mr B kindly consented to come 
and occupy our village and give the Soba and his men
all the Whiskey they wanted if he would drive us out and
he even went so far in his benevolent offers as to say he
would be willing to burn our houses and kill us all if the 
King would give him permission to do so. But the King
refused. Several of the Mission heard Mr B's Secretary
say that his master advised the King to kill us but the 
King refused.</p>

<p>Though unwilling to have us killed the Soba was
quite unable to withstand the pressure which was brought
upon him to drive us out and we were compelled to 
leave July 4th. Mr B. immediately taking possession
of our houses.</p>
