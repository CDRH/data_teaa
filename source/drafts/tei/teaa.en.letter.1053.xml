<p><add>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
SEP 10 1887
RECEIVED</add></p>

<p>Franklinton
Franklin Co N.C.
Sept. 8/87</p>

<p>Hon Thos F. Bayard
Secretary of State
Wasington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir: I received a
letter from the Treasury Department
informing me that I was due to the
Government of the U.S. for service as
Vice Consul General of the U.S. at
Monrovia Liberia $337.27.</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1196.jpg"/>

<p>Your government charged me for the
burial expenses of Moses A. Hopkins that I am
<gap reason="missing"/>willing to bear. Your government also
<gap reason="missing"/>harge me for paying a bill of Mrs
<gap reason="missing"/>E. J. Jarmon of Cape Palmos after telling
<gap reason="missing"/>me to do so. Please look over your
<gap reason="missing"/>consular series and you will see
<gap reason="missing"/>here the Department told me to do what
<gap reason="missing"/>Minister Smyth and Hopkins
<gap reason="missing"/>id not do. The bill due Mrs. Harmon
<gap reason="missing"/>as $48. and some cents and I paid
<gap reason="missing"/>in the U.S. draft. Your Government
<gap reason="missing"/>lso charged me $30.00 which I
<gap reason="missng"/>aid the U.S. Messenger who could not</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1197.jpg"/>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>ie one a voucher; because he
<gap reason="missing"/>ould not write his name.
<gap reason="missing"/>nt you remember Moses Hopkins
<gap reason="missing"/>note you a despatch about the
<gap reason="missing"/>messenger- stating that the boy could
<gap reason="missing"/>ot write his name? The messenger
could not write- that is the reason I
could not send in a voucher for
the $30.00 charged against me. I am
now in the U.S. and I have so hoped
<gap reason="missing"/>meeting the messenger again to
<gap reason="missing"/>t erase a cross mark from him.
<gap reason="missing"/>gain I wish the U.S. government to
<gap reason="missing"/>ember I was in a position of</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1198.jpg"/>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>which I was unacquainted with
<gap reason="missing"/>rules and regulations they allowed.
<gap reason="missing"/>messenger has been paid and I
<gap reason="missing"/>ay you in behalf of what I have lost
<gap reason="missing"/>carrying on the U.S. business at
<gap reason="missing"/>Monrovia Liberia that I be rewarded.
<gap reason="missing"/>Government also charged against
<gap reason="missing"/>me $30.50 drawen in favor of more
<gap reason="missing"/>sons. The State Department has voucher
<gap reason="missing"/>that Allow me to call the State
<gap reason="missing"/>partment to certain facts-
<gap reason="missing"/>ere were many small items to be
<gap reason="missing"/>aid at the U.S. Legation at Monrovia
<gap reason="missing"/>or which I could not draw a</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1199.jpg"/>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>raft for G Moore &amp; Sons paid these
<gap reason="missing"/>mall intens and at the end of the
<gap reason="missing"/>uarter I would always pay them in
<gap reason="missing"/>raft; that is the reason they would
<gap reason="missing"/><unclear></unclear> also give me voucher including
<gap reason="missing"/>messenger &amp;c.</p>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>ay the 7th 1887 the Department of State
charged against me $20.00 which I
paid out for wine. Now Sir- indeed
I could not prevent from drawing
that $20.00 on the Department. The
<gap reason="missing"/>lection of the Government of Liberia
<gap reason="missing"/>was over and the people of that
<gap reason="missing"/> place were going away visiting</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1200.jpg"/>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>Consular official of the various gover<gap reason="missing"/>
<gap reason="missing"/>ments and the officials were giving
<gap reason="missing"/>em a treat and I did the same;
<gap reason="missing"/>at is the reason the $20.00 is against
<gap reason="missing"/>me</p>

<p><gap reason="missing"/>His I think useless to write further.
<gap reason="missing"/>Outside of the $95.85 for burial expenses
<gap reason="missing"/>Moses A. Hopkins I think the
<gap reason="missing"/>overnment of the U.S. should pay
<gap reason="missing"/>me for what I have done at my
<gap reason="missing"/>est in its behalf. I was a servant
<gap reason="missing"/>the Presbyterian church in that
<gap reason="missing"/>ar off country and I did not</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1201.jpg"/>

<p>seek the position; but being
acquainted with Moses A. Hopkins
and knowing he was in a place
unknown <del>to him</del> I thought I would
be of use to hime therefore I took the
position and even held it long
before ever receiving a certificate of
recognition as Vice Consul Genl from
your peer; therefore how now can
your government be so exact on
me after laboring under many
disadvantages in its behalf?
I pray your government gives me
what due me. I know you will consider
my case as I have</p>

<pb n="Roll5-1202.jpg"/>

<p>State there. Please do all you
can for me. I am not going back
to Liberia; so I will not be able to
give you any vouchers.</p>

<p>Hoping you will do justice to my
case- and hoping to hear from
you soon</p>

<p>I remain
Dear Sir
Your obedient Servant</p>

<p>Samuel S. Sevier
Franklinton
Franklin Co
