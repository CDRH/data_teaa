<p>Department of State
   Monrovia Liberia
   May 16 1879</p>

<p>My Lord
          Referring to my dispatch of Oct. 16th
   1878, in which I informed your Lordship
   that the Liberian government had
   appointed two Commissioners to
   meet the mixed commission on the
   North Western boundary Question
   I have the honor to express the very deep
   request of His Exellency the President
   that the said commmission failed
   to accomplish the results so
   <unclear/> desired.</p>

<p>        I need not stop here to give
   you a detailed account of the
                         tedious

The Most Honourable
 The Marquis of Salisbury
  Foreign Office
   London</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0196.002"/>

<p>alleged to be giving to the tribes in
   the disputed territories. This govern
   ment cannot for amoment entertain
   the idea that their expectations will
   be realized, since it has long since
   been a matter of record that Great
   Britain acknowledges te <unclear/> of
   Liberia to all Territory between the
   "<unclear/> on the North West and the 
   "San Pedro on the South East. Nor can
   I suppose for a moment that Great
   Britain would allow on the part of
   her officials or citizens any actions
   What would kin to <unclear/>
   our National Fabric. First I simply 
   make this reference to show the
   effect that the attitude of HA
   government in connection with
   the North Western boundary <unclear/></p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0196.003"/>

<p>of the session yet believing that I aros from
   unavoidable causes they wave all
   complaint on that score. But where
   after the meeting of the Commission
   point arose upon which the Commission
   diagreed, this government fail to see
   upon what Grands HM Commission
   was refused to submit those points to
   the Arbitration of the United States
   government. This occurred first 
   Sierra Leone whre a point of dis
   agreement arose, which in the financier
   of this governments should have been
   submitted to the NY Arbitrator for
   warded fufeldt; according to the terms
   of the Draft Proposals which has
   been suggested by H.M. Government
   and accepted by Liberia as the basis
   of the investigation to such a
                          course</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0196.004"/>

<p>H.M. Commissioners presistently objected.</p>

<p>The Commissioners in the conviction
   of the justice of  Our <unclear/>, and
   anxious for a settlement of the Question;
   yeilded.</p>

<p> An adjournment was agreed upon
   by the Mixed Commissions in <unclear/>
   <unclear/> of which they met at Sobymah
   on the 1st of April last. The result
   of eighteen days deliberation-during
   which the Commission examined the 
   Title deeds of this government and
   took oral testimony of witnesses brought
   forward on the part of this govern
   ment as well as on behalf of the native
   Chiefs repduiating our claims to
   sovereignty-was another disappoint
   ments-The Liberia Commissions
                        holding</p>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0196.005"/>

<p>holding that we had proved our title to
    the territories known as "<unclear/>,"
    "<unclear/>, Rock & Rock" and "Solymah"
     and H.m. Commissioners averting
   that no such countries existed.</p>

<p>     The Liberian Commissioners
   submitted that, according to the
   terms of the Draft Proposals, <unclear/>
   above, and the Instructions of
   both the English and Liberian
   Commissioners, the matter
   should be referred tot he American
   Arbitration for his decision.

        This your Commissioners
    refused to do, <unclear/> their in-
    ability to do more than take
   the opinion of the American
   </p>
