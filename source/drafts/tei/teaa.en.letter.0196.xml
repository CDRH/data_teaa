<p>Department of State
   Monrovia Liberia
   May 16 1879</p>

<p>My Lord
          Referring to my dispatch of Oct. 16th
   1878, in which I informed your Lordship
   that the Liberian government had
   appointed two Commissioners to
   meet the mixed commission on the
   North Western boundary Question
   I have the honor to express the very deep
   request of His Exellency the President
   that the said commmission failed
   to accomplish the results so
   <unclear/> desired.</p>

<p>        I need not stop here to give
   you a detailed account of the
                         tedious

The Most Honourable
 The Marquis of Salisbury
  Foreign Office
   London</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.002"/>

<p>alleged to be giving to the tribes in
   the disputed territories. This govern
   ment cannot for amoment entertain
   the idea that their expectations will
   be realized, since it has long since
   been a matter of record that Great
   Britain acknowledges te <unclear/> of
   Liberia to all Territory between the
   "<unclear/> on the North West and the 
   "San Pedro on the South East. Nor can
   I suppose for a moment that Great
   Britain would allow on the part of
   her officials or citizens any actions
   What would kin to <unclear/>
   our National Fabric. First I simply 
   make this reference to show the
   effect that the attitude of HA
   government in connection with
   the North Western boundary <unclear/></p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.003"/>

<p>of the session yet believing that I aros from
   unavoidable causes they wave all
   complaint on that score. But where
   after the meeting of the Commission
   point arose upon which the Commission
   diagreed, this government fail to see
   upon what Grands HM Commission
   was refused to submit those points to
   the Arbitration of the United States
   government. This occurred first 
   Sierra Leone whre a point of dis
   agreement arose, which in the financier
   of this governments should have been
   submitted to the NY Arbitrator for
   warded fufeldt; according to the terms
   of the Draft Proposals which has
   been suggested by H.M. Government
   and accepted by Liberia as the basis
   of the investigation to such a
                          course</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.004"/>

<p>H.M. Commissioners presistently objected.</p>

<p>The Commissioners in the conviction
   of the justice of  Our <unclear/>, and
   anxious for a settlement of the Question;
   yeilded.</p>

<p> An adjournment was agreed upon
   by the Mixed Commissions in <unclear/>
   <unclear/> of which they met at Sobymah
   on the 1st of April last. The result
   of eighteen days deliberation-during
   which the Commission examined the 
   Title deeds of this government and
   took oral testimony of witnesses brought
   forward on the part of this govern
   ment as well as on behalf of the native
   Chiefs repduiating our claims to
   sovereignty-was another disappoint
   ments-The Liberia Commissions
                        holding</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.005"/>

<p>holding that we had proved our title to
    the territories known as "<unclear/>,"
    "<unclear/>, Rock & Rock" and "Solymah"
     and H.m. Commissioners averting
   that no such countries existed.</p>

<p>     The Liberian Commissioners
   submitted that, according to the
   terms of the Draft Proposals, <unclear/>
   above, and the Instructions of
   both the English and Liberian
   Commissioners, the matter
   should be referred tot he American
   Arbitration for his decision.

        This your Commissioners
    refused to do, <unclear/> their in-
    ability to do more than take
   the opinion of the American
   Arbitration, and claiming that
   such opinion could have no ef
   fect in settling the Question
                           unless</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.006"/>

<p>unless approved oby H.M. government.
    In the face of their instructions
   and the Draft Proposals above
   cited our Commissioners could
   not agree to this and the Com-
   mission adjourned.</p>

<p>     Unless, My Lord, the Liberian
   government have utterly failed 
   to undertand the terms of the
   Draft Proposals, accepted by both
   governments as the basis for the 
   settlement of this question, I beg
   most respectfully to insist that
   there is a manifest <unclear/> on the part
   of H.M. Commissioners.</p>

<p>     I say error because I cannot
   conceive that, in the face of the
   very positive instructions eman
   ating from H.M. government 
                        enjoining</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.007"/>

<p>enjoining upon the Commissioners strict im
   partiality they could allow them-
   selves to be influenced by any other
   than moper motives.</p>

<p>     I am quite aware that there
   is a very strong effort put forth on
   the part of British Tradeers in
   that Neighborhood to render suc
   cessful the efforts of the Aborigines
   to repudiate over authority, and
   while we have abundant reason
   to believe that the dismemberment,
    -aye were the extinctions of Liberia
   would wokin the opinion of these
   Traders be too great a price at 
   which to secure for themselves
   the produce of that country,
   Yet I am sure that there is too
   high a sense of justice and honor
                                not</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.008"/>

<p>not to say magnanimity in H.M.
   government, as well as those
   who represent her in official
   relations, to sympathise with
   any such selfish feelings. And 
   I cherish the opinion that it 
   is only necessary to call the at-
   tention of H.M. government
   to this subject,in order to have
   the points in dispute referred
   to the Arbitration.</p>

<p>     Your Lordship will pardon
   me for further trespassing on
   your kindness, while I call your
   attention to one or two points.</p>

<p>     In this Question of the
   North Western boundary of the
   Republic, whcih has for so many
   years being pending and which
                            has</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.009"/>

<p>has caused incalculable loss to this
   governments H.M. government
   sets up no claim to the territory
   and has therefore nothing to lose
   by the delay of its settlement, but
   Liberia on the other hand is con-
   tinually losing in consequence
   of this dispute. If you will
   take into consideration the
   large amount of money that
   would have accrued to thus govern-
   ment had we been permitted to
   enforce our Revenue Laws, as well
   as the outlays that we have made
   from time to time first in efforts
   to suppress the slave trade, and
   then to enforce order and keep peace
   among the several tribes of that
   seating you can readily under-
                            stand</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.010"/>

<p>stand our wish for a speedy settlement of
         the matter.</p>

<p>      And furthermore there is 
   a poin t of far graver character to
   which it is my duty to call your 
   attention. Infer to the general
   spirit of insubordination and rebellion
   against the authority of the 
   government which is springing
   up among the natives in almost
   every part of this Republic, growing
   out of this Question.</p>

<p>     Exclusive combinations are
   being formed among the tribes
   to throw off then allegiance to
   this government under the im
   pression that H.M. government
   will afford the same encourage
   ment and support that it 
                      is</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.011"/>

<p>alleged to be giving to the tribes in
   the disputed territories. This government
   cannot for a moment entertain
   the idea that their expectations will
   be realized, since it has long since
   been a matter of record that Great
   Britain acknowledges the claims of
   Liberia to all territory between the
   "<unclar/> on the North West and the 
   "founders" on the South East. Nor can
   I suppose for a moment that Great 
   Britain would allow on the part of
   her officials or citizens any actions
   that would tend to undermine
   our National Fabric. But I simply
   make this reference to show the
   effect that the attitude of H.M.
   government in connection with
   the North Western boundary <unclear/>
                                  is</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0196.012"/>

<p>is producing on the tribes within our
   domain.</p>

<p>Trusting that your Lordship
   will take an early opportunity of
   calling the attention of H.M. govern-
   ment to the subject of this dispatch,
   and assuring you of very high con-
   sideration,
            I have the honor to be
                your Lordship's obt. svt.
