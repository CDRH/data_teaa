<p>No 14/f</p>

<p>New-Antwerp, November 8, 1907.
ANNEX TO THE LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR 
Mr. Governor General,</p>
    
<p>I have the honor to confirm my telegram to you from 
this day as follows:</p>
    
<p>"Response to no. 739/f, from October 14. No 12/f, Consul
"General of the United States to be moved to New-Antwerp September 
"II  to Stanleyville nothing specific 
"to inform of for passage to New-Antwerp. Arrive in the after-
"noon leave the next morning I learned after the Consul
"General of the United States to be left at Upoto and around de-
"tails by confidential letter."</p>
    
<p>As follows by this telegram, I have the honnor, 
Mr. Governor General, to communicate to you the following: 
Mr. Consul General of the United States, Smith, arrived at New- 
Antwerp by steamboat "Harry Read" around 2 1/2 hours from
the afternoon, September 11. He quit the next morning 
by the first hour. The afternoon of the passage by Mr.
Consul General had been consecrated by a walk in the 
cultures (Funtumia et Hevea) and at a visit to the lazaretto
just as in the station. I have personally diven Mr.
Consul General during this visit and the night of the dinner  
that I offered him, he announced strongly enchanted with his 
visit and of what he had seen in New-Antwerp.</p>

<p>Mr. Consul General Smith, while leaving New-Antwerp, 
told me that he had the intention of going as far as
Stanleyville.</p>
    
<p>It was not so, for in fact, he stopped 
in Upoto. Something that I didn't know after his visit here,
on the way down in October.</p>
    
<p>Following/After the details that were given to me by 
Mr. Substitute Detry, by his return to New-Antwerp, 
las November 2, Mr. Consul General Smith would have arrived
in Upoto and from there in Lisala where he would have been invited to 
dine September 18. Assisted to dinner. Mr. Prosecutor 
of State Gréban de Saint Germain, Mr. Hutereau, Commander of</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>The next day, Mr. Consul General Smith left for 
Gali, accompanied by Reverand Dodds.
For this trip I did not obtain any details.</p>
    
<p>From Gali, they went to Bayenge where they remained 
several days (from the 22nd-28th). The 27th, Mr. Substitue
Detry arrived and Mr. Consul General Smith announced 
his departure for the next morning. During his stay in Bayenge,
Mr. Consul General Smith wanted to proceed to  
experience the rubber harvest. </p> 
    
<p>Driven by Mr. Everaert, they were taken to the forest 
accompanied by a certain nomber of workers. They 
proceeded to the harvest and after the information 
that supplied me by Mr. Detry, the result est 
that a man can produce, complete transfer, 3 kilos of
rubber for two hours or work.</p>
    
<p>The 27th, in the evening, the dinner was presided by Mr.  
Substitute Detry. In the course of the conversation, Mr. Consul
General Smith had volunteered this opinion: "I now realize 
the difficulties that they have here and from
work that was made".</p>
    
<p>The 28th, in the morning, Mr. Smith, always accompanied by Mr. 
Dodds, left for Yambata where he arrived the same
day. During the stay in Yambata, Mr. Speck, the Chief of the area, 
accompanied them the entire time. I know nothing 
specific to highlight.</p>
 
 <p>From Yambata, the travelers left for Dobo where
 they arrived October 4, dinned there with Mr. Prosecutor
 of State Gréban de Saint Germian and from there, left 
 October 5 to move.</p>
    
<p>October 10th, Mr. Consul General of the United States
passed in New-Antwerp around the middle of the morning.
He continued immediately.</p>
    
<p>Such are, Mr. Governor General, the information
that I could obtain up to this day.</p>
    
<p>The Commissionary of the district, 
(s) Gehot.</p>
