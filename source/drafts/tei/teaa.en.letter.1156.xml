<p>Synopsis</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1065.jpg"/>

<p>No 9 Consulate General Series:,
United States Legation Monrovia
Liberia January 10, 1891.</p>

<p>To the Honorable
William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State 
Washington D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
respectfully acknowledge the
receipt of your circulars of November
3rd and 8th 1890 marked [(S2)
11,,3:90-500)(Sd 11,,11:-90-1000)
agricultural Department] with
there accompanying inclosures viz
1. Regulation for inspecting cattle
2. ,, <gap/> ,, <gap/> ,, Salt meets:
also circular marked (SD 11,, 8-90-1000
viz. Sheet and Roadways;
In reply I am <unclear></unclear> to say that
there are no cattle or salt meets
exported from Monrovia or any
port of the Republic of Liberia [as
per circulars marked (SD 11,,3,,90-500)]</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1066.jpg"/>

<p>or (SD- 11-90-1000;
Indeed live stock of all kind
are of a very infoerior kind; the
cows weight from 455 hundred giving
from a print to print and one half
of milks sheep, goats are small weighing
from 20 to 50 pounds - hogs weight from
one pound to 125 chicken are small
no horses in the country or a least
in Monrovia;</p>

<p>Circular marked (SD 11, 8,'' 90-1000)
Streets and roadways &amp;c;
Monrovia Liberia though the Cappital
of the Republic with a population
variously estimated from 3000 to
5000 have not a street or alley
pavid; The Streets and alleys are
merely covered with grass and weeds
intermingle with beautiful wild
flowers the side walks are in
places cleared by cutting out the grass,
the city of Monrovia is situated at an 
altitude of 300 to 400 feet above the
level of the sea. on a rock covering
the <unclear></unclear> sight on which the only rest</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1067.jpg"/>

<p>There are no waggons wheel
barrows; go east on wheel vehicle
of any kind used in the city
or country <unclear></unclear> the houses
are brick and fram in the
city proper mostly two story
high enclosed by stone fences
the two Snburban towns, viz
Kroo, townand vie town are
a part of the corporate limits of
Monrovia The people of these
two precincts are Natives- viz
Kroo-men and vie-men;
the Post office is in Kroo
town. which to reach it make
a nice letter walk of 2 1/2 miles
from the center of the city
proper. The Kroo and Vie
houses are made of thatches
with dirt floors and my opinion
is that they are healthier than the
brick home. The legation building are
the finest and best built house in the
city but like all the brick houses
it is damp and unhealthy and</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1068.jpg"/>

<p>and there are no exceptions
to the houses being damp
in the rainy season which
commences in October and
holdes till the first of April.
I am satisfied that for
central location looks and
convience no better house
could be secured and as
the lease of it by Mr John H
Smyth has expired some
two years ago and on renewed
of said lease I have re-leased
it upon the same terms for
two years from Jany just
(1) 1891- which I hope will eet your
approval &amp;c I have the honor to
be your obedient
servant</p>

<p>Alexander Clark</p>
