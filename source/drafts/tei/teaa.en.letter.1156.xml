<p><sic>recepts</sic> of
Circulars and reply;</p>

<p>Synopsis</p>

<pb n="Roll6-1065.jpg"/>

<p>No 9. Consulate General Series;<lb/>
United States Legation Monrovia.<lb/>
Liberia January 10th 1891;<lb/>
To the<lb/>
Honorable William F. Wharton,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/> 
Washington DC;</p>

<p>Sir;</p>

<p>I have the honor to
respectfully acknowledge the
<sic>recept</sic> of your circulars of November
3rd and 8th 1890 marked (SD. 11, 3:90-500)
(SD. 11, 11:-90-1000)
Agricultural Department with
<sic>there</sic> accompanying Inclosures viz</p>

<p>Regulation for inspecting cattle;<lb/>
 " " " Salt <sic>meets</sic>;<lb/>
Also circular marked (SD 11, 8-90-1000
viz. Street and Roadways;</p>

<p>In reply I am sorrow to say that
there are no cattle or salt <sic>meets</sic>
exported from Monrovia or any
part of the Republic of Liberia as
per circulars marked (SD. 11, 3, 90-500)

<pb n="Roll6-1066.jpg"/>

or (SD. 11, 11-90-1000;</p>

<p>Indeed live stock of all kind
are of a very <sic>infearior</sic> kind; The
cows weigh from 4 to 5 hundred giving
from a pint to pint and one half
of milk Sheep, goats are small weighing
from 20 to 50 pounds. hogs <sic>weight</sic> from
one pound to 125. chicken are small
no horses in the country or <sic>a</sic> least
in Monrovia;</p>

<p>Circular marked (SD 11, 8, 90-1000)
Streets and roadways <unclear>&amp;c;</unclear></p>

<p>Monrovia Liberia though the Capital
of the Republic with a population
variously estimated from 3000 to
5000 have not a Street or alley
paved; The Streets and alleys are
<sic>nicly</sic> covered with grass and weeds
intermingle with beautiful wild
flowers. the side walks are in
places cleared by cutting out the grass
The city of Monrovia is situated at an 
altitude of 300 to 400 feet above the
level of the sea. on a rock covering
the <sic>intire</sic> sight on which the city <unclear>rests</unclear>

<pb n="Roll6-1067.jpg"/>

There are no <sic>waggons</sic> wheelbarrows; 
go-cart or wheel vehicle
of any kind used in the city
or country <unclear extent="one word"/> The houses
are brick and <sic>fram</sic> in the
city proper mostly two <sic>storys</sic>
high, enclosed by stone fences
The two Suburban towns, viz
Kroo Town and <sic>Vie</sic> Town are
a part of the corporate limits of
Monrovia The people of these
two precincts are Natives, viz
Kroo-men and <sic>Vie</sic>-men;
The Post office is in Kroo
Town, which to reach it make
a nice little walk of 2½ miles
from the center of the city
proper. The Kroo and <sic>Vie</sic>
houses are made of thatches
with dirt floors, and my opinion
is that they are healthier than the
brick home. The Legation building are
the finest and best built house in the
city but like all the brick houses
it is damp and unhealthy and

<pb n="Roll6-1068.jpg"/>

and there are no exception
to the houses being damp
in the rainy season which
commences in October and
<sic>holdes</sic> till the first of April.
I am satisfied that for
central location looks and
<sic>convienece</sic> no better house
could be secured, and as
the lease of it by Mr John H
Smyth had expired some
two years ago and no <del>released</del> renewal
of said lease I have re-leased
it upon the same terms for
two years from Jany first
(1) 1891, which I hope will meet your
approval &amp;c I have the honor to
be your obedient
servant</p>

<p>Alexander Clark</p>
