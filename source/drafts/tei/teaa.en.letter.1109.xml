against which the Draft was
drawn was exhausted, and that
"the Secretary of the Treasury
will make the necessary request

of Mr Smith, the new Minister

General ceased January 11th 1888,
and Mr Smith's commenced
July 10th 1888, the intervening time,
I served, and am entitled to the
salary as per advice referred to.</p>

<p>If the Draft will

holders of same, Messers
