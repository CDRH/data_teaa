<p><add>DEPARTMENT OF STATE
OCT 6 1888
RECEIVED.</add></p>

<p>Monrovia, Liberia
August 31st 1888.</p>

<p>Mr B. Y. Payne to the
Assistant Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Subject</p>

<p>Receipt of your No 10 of
July 19th 1888 with enclosures.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of
your above noted, with
inclosures of Statement of
account, and blank Draft,
for service rendered from
January 12th to March 31st last;
informing me that the Department
had concluded to recognize
me as Vice Consul of the
United States at Monrovia,
from January 12th lact, and to
allow me full delay of the
Consulate General from that date
date</p>

<pb n="Roll5-2004.jpg"/>

<p>date until the arrival of Mr
Smith: for which you have
my sincere thanks.</p>

<p>I beg to state again for
your information that the
two messengers were employed
by Mr Taylor, and left at the
Legation. I am surprise at his
not informing the Department of
the fact. I was of the same
opinion of the Department, that
one messenger was sufficient,
and, I discharched one at the
end of March, as you will
have observed by my June
Querter return.</p>

<p>My claim of $82.50 has been
demanded of Mr Taylor by the
holders of my Draft, and I have
been informed of Mr. Taylor
refusal to settle it.</p>

<p>As my account for contingent
expense for June quarter
contained nothing that was
not approved in previous
previous</p>

<pb n="Roll5-2005.jpg"/>

<p>previous account, I shall draw
in due course on the Department
for services from March
31st to July 10th last, the date of
Mr Smith's arrival.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,</p>

<p>Beverly Y. Payne.</p>

<p>Hon., G. L. Rives,
Assistant Sec'y State</p>

<p>Inclosure,</p>

<p>Statement of Account
to March 31st 1888.
Acct for Salery January 12
1888 to March 31 1888</p>
