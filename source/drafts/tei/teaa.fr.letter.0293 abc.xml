<p>424 W. Chelten Ave. Germantown, Philad Pa
September 18 1906.</p>

<p>James Gustavus Whiteley,</p>

<p>Sir, Consul,</p>

<p>Your communication of date Brussels, July 23. 1906
mis-sent to the Congo Reform Association, finally reached
me Aug. 17. while I was confined under a surgical
operation in the Presbyterian Hospital of this city.
I emerged only a few days go.</p>

<p>You give me your address both in Paris and Baltimore.
I choose the latter address. And, though your letter
leaves somewhat to be desired in the matter of
courtesy, I reply to it.</p>

<p>When I landed in New York on the 7. of last June,
I was, in half an hour, surrounded by half a dozen
reporters. I did not, and do not know whom they represented,
though tey doubtless told me. They asked me about
the Kongo atrocities; and I answered freely, as I do
every where. They got my statements somewhat disjointed,
in intervals of the examination of my large lot of
luggage by the Custom House officials. Naturally, they
made some mistakes. I am not on a Lecture-Tour for the
Congo Reform Association of the U.S. At that time, I 
did not know even of that Association's existence.</p>

<p>What I said to them wa that, in my missionary addresses
among the Churches during my furlough, I should animal-
vert on those atrocities.</p>

<p>I have not been in the Kongo Free State. There are
3 "Congos": the Kongo Free State, or Kongo Belge; the
Kongo River; and the Kongo Français. What I said to them
was that I had been 45 years in the Kongo-Français, a few
hundred mils north of the Kongo river.</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>I am a missionary of the American Presbyterian
Church (north) offices at 156 Fifth. Ave New York city
One of my stations being Libreville, in the Gaboon river,
exactly on the equator; Libreville being headquarter
of the Colonial Government of the Kongo-Français until
its authority was divided with Brazzaville on the Kongo.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that I am <choice><sic>unkown</sic> <corr>unknown</corr></choice> to the Free
State officials. But, they could have heart of me had
they inquired of Rev. Mr. Grenfell and other Baptist
missionaries; of Rev. Messrs. Verner and Phipps of the
Am. Presb. (south); and of the American Missionaries at
Boma. Your officials would argue themselves unknown
if they could not hear of me through the Captains of
any of Elder Dempster line of steamers running as
far south as the Gaboon and Kongo rivers. Or, from my
friend Consul Sir Alfred Jones.</p>

<p>A few hours after I had told those reporters that
story of the flogging to death of that young woman, one
of them followe me to 156 Fifth. Ave, with his written
version of it, and asked me to sign it as correct.</p>

<p>I did not know who he was nor whom he represented. It 
was substantially correct. A month later I was shown
it in the "Journal-Exam". The preliminary and the final
remarks are not mine, though they are true. The story
itself is, excepting the two minor inaccuracies, viz
that the white man did the flogging; and, that the flogging
was continued on the second day. Indeed, I doubt
whether these two points are inaccuracies. Practically
the white man did do the flogging; it was done for him 
at the point of his pistol: one of his native would not
hesitate to do the flogging himself if it was convenient
for him. And, as to the second day's flogging, I have
no doubt it also was done. He did as bad with that honey.
People familiar with African insects know their abundan-</p>

<pb></pb>

<p>ce, their universality and their torture.</p>

<p>I heard this case talked of on the english steamers
at the time. It was commonly known. That was 2 years
ago. I can not recall the persons, captains and passengers,
whom I overheard talking about it. Their version
was one of the "portions" of the girl's body covered
by the honey was her genitals. I have no doubt that it
was so. For the <choice><sic>stamement</sic><corr>statement</corr></choice> was also made that the "service"
in which she was engaged to this man was as his
mistress. Of this also I have no doubt. In my long and
intimate acquaintance with african conditions, I know
that many of the white commercial foreign population
have their native "Wives" more or less openly held.
Some of them treat their young women kindly; some are
cruel. I know of no service which young women render
in the trading houses other than a sexual one.</p>

<p>I wish to repeat that I am not, and have not been,
in any way, connected with the American Congo Reform
Association, except that I heartily approve of its object
and its work; a work for which my sympathy was early
extended to Mr. E.D. Morel of Liverpool.</p>
    
<p>Very truly yours,
(s) Robert Hamill Nassau</p>    
    
<p>His Honor,
J.G Whiteley, Consul General of the Congo Free
State to the United States of America.</p>
