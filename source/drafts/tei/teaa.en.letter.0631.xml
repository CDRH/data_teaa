<ab>Consulate of the United States 
of America at Bathurst Gambia
15th December 1860</ab>
    
<p>Sir:
My report of last
year was upon the trade and the 
commerce of Gambua as shown by
statistics of 1858. I now purpose to 
make the Returns of 1859, the basis 
of this annual report.</p>
    
<p>I have also the pleasure of adding the
report from the district of Sierra Leone 
Henry Rder Esq. Consular Agent.</p>
    
<p>The year 1859 was not 
a favorable one to the commerce of 
Gambia. The crops were short; impor-
tations were more limited than in
the proceeding year and consequently 
the Customs revenue showed a defe-
iency as compared with recent previsions 
years, and above all <unclear/> <unclear/> 

for</p>
    
<ab>The Honorable Lewis Cap
Secretary of State of the United States</ab>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100338"/>
    
<p>for a season, robbing the commercial
communit of many members.</p>
    
<p>The deficiency in the 
crop of Ground nuts, the chief article
of export, was nearly one half as 
compared with 1858 and about
1500 tons below the average of the 
past twelve years (1848 to 1859-
inclsuive): this too, when in the 
first few years the article was but
a new one, and not extensively cul-
-tioated, or eagerly sought after.</p>
    
<p>It is practically accounted for by the 
scarcity of win in the previous "rainy
season", the internal was among the 
native tribes, who are the only cultioa-
-tors and the poor state of the soil
arising from renewed plantings
without proper heatineub and the 
impoverishing effects of the extraor-
dinary crop of 15.728 tons of the pre-
-vious year.</p>
    
<p>Hides, too, for seasons not 
so easily explained, show a decrease
of thirteen thousand nine hundred 

and</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100344"/>
    
<p><unclear/> to impede the developement
of American trade on this Coast.</p>
    
<p>Unfortunately many of the articles re-
quired in legitimate commerceee are 
used also in the slave-trade, namely
Rum, lumber, empty casks for palm
oil and spice: many instances have 
occured where vessels pursuing a 
legitmate voyage have suffered detention 
and been subject to trial on suspicion
of being slavers thereby breaking up
the voyage and causing only loss to 
owners. I can mention two cases in this
colony the "S.W. Nash" and the "Mary Varsey"
and in Sierra Leone. The "Thomas Watson"
and the "Carolina".</p>
    
<p>The means for supplying the slave-
trade it is evident one not essential
notwithstanding the <unclear/> expenditure
by Great Britain and the United States 
in maintaining a costly squaderon and 
in attempting to bockade this coast:
for it is notorious that, in the past
twelve months more slaves have been 
shipped than ever before. And why?</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100349"/>
   
<p>of Demand and supply
for the simple mercantile axiom 
for the demand has been great for the 
Cuban maker: and as long as that
demand continues, as long as the 
profits on a singlr cargo are so im-
-mense that one successful voyage
out of six is <unclear/>, man wil
be found sufficently bold to 
succrssfully carry out the voyage.</p>   
 
<p>The Cuban market now alone remained
Destroyed that market and thes slave 
trade ceass to exist, if that is im-
-possible why not bllockade the 
coast of Cuba? the point of destination;
a far more feasible plan than to attempt 
to blockade half the continent of Africa!
The law of nationas may not permit
but cannot England, France and 
the United States in the name of 
humanity insist that Spain shall
make a treaty to that affect?</p>
    
<p>Is England anxious to carry out 
such a course? Doesw she not desire
more benefit by the present mode of 

supprepion</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100355"/>
    
<p>and ninety seven as compared with 
the yield of the preceeding year (which
was but little better than the average 
of the last twelve years. May not this
have arisen in a measure from the 
same internal wars and consequent 
loss of the bides of cattle consumed
by the combatants, which in Peace
would have been carefully preserved
and finally found their way to this
market?</p>
    
<p>Bees-wax, the third article 
of export also shows a deficit of 25
tons, in comparison with 1858.</p>
    
<p>The quality of the Gambia 
Ground nut surpasses that of any
produced, and the trade of the place
depends very materially upon that
feul.</p>
    
<p>It has been observed
by some of the oldest merchants
here-with much concern--that,
the quality is depreciating. The neigh-
-boring rivers Consumance. Jeba, and 
Rio Grande and the envirous of
Sierra-Leone produce the Ground-Nut

in</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100402"/>
    
<p>in large quantities but of quality inferior
to "Gambias", both as regards their outward
apperance (important as an article of 
coport to the United States) and their
intrusive <unclear/> proportioned (upon which 
their value for European markets is solely
based).    This depication in
quality is mainly owing tp the fact that 
many of the tribes, particularly <unclear/> who
cultivate them in the River below McCathy
Island have adopted the more speedy
m ode og threshing instead of picking by
hand: whereby the Nuts are mixed with 
leaves, <unclear/>, stones, and then esteamed
substances, causing large deductions in
the French market and depreciating theit 
value in the United States as an article of 
food.</p>
   
<p>The present Governor 
of this Colony Colonel d'Aray, well aware
of the importance of substaining the repu-
-tation of this our principal export has most
wisely endeaored to counteract the baneful
effects of this mode of harvesting, by calling 
together the Chiefs of the neighboring tribes

and</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100408"/>
    
<p>(<unclear/>): it bears some Bird Island
spit West by North three quarters North
distance two + a half miles and from 
the Blackberry South East half South
ten + a half miles by <unclear/>
dog.</p>
    
<p>The bearings of the BlackBerry (for
which vessels should steer upon
learning the Red Berry) and its 
situation are as follows: it is placed
on the month end of African Knoll
in two and a half fathoms of water
(springs) and its bearings are
Cape St. Mary West by South 
hald South. Tower at Bathurst 
South by East one quarter East and 
middle of Terminal Creek East 
three quarters North. All the henings
by <unclear/>.</p>
    
<p>I beg, now, to call
your attention to the annexed tubular
statements Nos. 1.2.3 and 4.
By reference to No. 1 you will observe
that the value of the Imports + Exports 

for</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100427"/>

<p>climates of the globe, we escaped 
the frightful effects of epidemics in 
other more favored, and more
healthy climes. The first death was
on the twenty third of July, from 
that time to its celstation in Septem-
ber we lost twenty three persons 
out of an European population of 
seventy two.</p>
    
<p>In "Commercial Regulations"
there is one important change nope,
on the eighteenth of April 1860 a new 
Colonial ordinance was enacted
relative to port changes: the partic-
ulars of which are as follows:
"Upon all ships, boats + vessels, canoes 
alone excepted, of more than five tons 
whether British or Foreign and whether
registered or not in the port of Bathurst
entering the River Gambia or employed 
or plying within the limits thereof 
a Quarantive fee of Twenty one
shilings in each year <unclear/> on
<unclear/> first entrance into the port of 
Bathurst. Provided always that all

vessels</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100432"/>
    
<p>vessels employed solely in the 
River Gambia shall not be liable 
to pay the <unclear/> Quarantive Fee.
Upon all ships, boats, or vessels of
more than fifteen/15/ tons whether 
British or Foreign + whether regis-
tered or not in the port of Bathurst
white solely employed within the 
River Gambia a duty of one
shiling per ton, registered ton-
nage shall be paid to the collector
of customs on or before the 31st day 
of January for the earnest year:
provided always that upon
any such vessel proceedings
<unclear/> tp pay the additional
one shiling per ton.</p>
    
<p>All vessls over fifteen/ 15/ tons 
whether British or Foreign <unclear/>
shall pay two shillings per
registered ton once in every year.
Vessels that have paid the 
one shillings + nine pence per 
ton (the former sake of tonage)
during the current year shall</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100437"/>
    
<p>pay three pence additional to 
make up the two shillings".</p>
    
<p>Vessels <unclear/> of
entering the River Gambia have 
for the past six years suffered
much inconvenience from the 
fact that Bird Island at the 
month of the River + one of the 
principal points mentioned in  
the sailing <unclear/> has been
gradually sinking and for three
years has not been visible at high
tides: there was formerly a Flag-
staff on this island devoting the 
pilot station, which neighbors
were particulary requested to note
as a guide: all this has disappeared
The pilots now remain in their 
boat anchored off the old side of 
the Island, Vessels approaching 
the entrance should endeavor to 
make the order or Red Beroy placed
in 1859 on the Red Bank in five +
a half (5 1/2) fathoms of water (mud)
at the third hour of flood tide

(neats)</p>
    
<pb facs="20170616_100447"/>
    
<p>than by the one proposed above?
"Liberated Africans" furnish her with
soldiers for her three West India
Regiments, laborers for her African
Colonies, laborers for her possessions
in the West Indies!</p>
    
<p>The United States main-
tain a squaderon of one hundred +
thirteen guns and what benefit 
do we devise? None- no soldiers,
no laborers, our legitimate trade
<unclear/> and our flag often subject
to insult.</p>
    
<p>I have the honor to be
Sir,
Your obident + humble servant 
Daniel R.B. Upton
U.S. Consul</p>
