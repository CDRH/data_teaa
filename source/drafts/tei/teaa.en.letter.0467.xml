<ab>Commercial Agency of the United States,
Kongo Free State, Stanley Pool, Dec 20, 1892

Mr. R. Dorsey Mohew
To the Department of State.

Subject:
Rehuen to Pool from Kassai
River

Abstract of Contents.
Visit to Lake Leopold II + the 
LouKings River</ab>
    
<pb facs="20170614_143402"/>
<p>Honorable William F. Wharton
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform you
that I have just arrived here
from the shead workers of the 
Loukenya River, and shall
leave next week for the 
San Kouran + Kassai Riveer.
The country any great distances
back from the river backs it
is hardly possible to see on
account of the hostility of the
natives, and noe that the Mauyema
people (commonly called "arabs") have
declared a general war against
all whites traveling without
a large escort is most dan-
gerous.</p>

<p>To hesitate November 23d 
I</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_143408"/>
<p>was some 375 miles up the 
Loukenya slipping was a village
called Maiyeaye. I desired to see
the natives making clock + asked
permission of the chief to visit
the town, which was readily
granted. I only looks six men
with me armed with revolves
war their whites. When I had
gather about ten minutes dis-
tance from the town. I was most-
foully attackked from the bush 
with spears + poisoned arrows.
Fortuantely none of my men were
struck and before they could 
throw their arrows again we had
opened fire + drove the natives
ahead. We captured the villlage
and I burned it to the ground 
to teach them a lesson. The 
next day the chief sent me some 
goats + desired to make blood
brotherhood + declare peace which 
I was more than gland to grant
This is only one of the five

or</p>  
  
<pb facs="20170614_143416"/>
<p>or 
six times I have been compelled to 
fight during the past few months.
If my report when sent to the De-
partment does not seem to com-
prehend the whole of the Kongo
State, it will be because I have
not enough of a force to penetrate 
to shore parts.</p>
    
<p>The whole Eastern boundary of
the state is now shut by the 
Arabs and all the white men who 
were in the different ports have 
been killed. Their bodies were 
afterwords eaten by the large
member of cannibal slaves attached
to the caravans.
So far my health has been 
good.

I am Sir:
Very respectfully
Your obident Servant
R. Dorsey Mohew
Commercial Agent</p>
