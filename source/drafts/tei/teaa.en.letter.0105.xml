Loanda 17 October 1876</dateline>

<p>Sir,<lb/>
I have the honor to place
before the Department the 
following facts which may 
prove of considerable interest to 
the Commercial Community of
the United States who may 
have business relations with 
this part of the Coast of
Africa.</p>

<p>In years past a 
considerable trade used to be
done between this Port and 
America in Pea nuts and
<catchwords>I</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0105.003"/>
I now regret to inform the
Department that this year there
has been a total failure of
the Pea nut crop and I do
not think it likely that any
will be exported to the states
this season.</p>

<p>For the last few years
there has been a very perceptable
decline in the quantity of Pea nuts
brought into this market
for sale, it is supposed by
many that owing to the great 
want of rain in 1873 the 
Natives consumed what should
have  been reserved as seed
as means of saving themselves
from starvation. There is another
theory which I consider more
<catchwords>probable</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0105.004"/>
probable and which if correct
will cause Pea nuts gradually
to disappear from among the
Exports from Angola, namely 
that the low price now offered
does not give sufficient  encouragement
to the Natives
to plant, while on the other
hand coffee, and more lately
Rubber offer them for a less
modicum of work, far greater
remuneration. Natives will
bring the Produce to this
market often over a hundred
miles and it is evident what
if for a cargo of Rubber they 
can obtain 24 dollars, or for 
coffee 9  dollars, they will
neglect the Pea nuts, as for 
<catchwords>a</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0105.005"/>
a similiar load they would 
only receive 1 dollar 80 cents.
Coffee and Rubber cost to
the natives little more trouble 
to collect than Pea nuts, all
being indiginous to the country 
and in abundance.</p>

<p>The late absence of Pea nuts
has greatly affected the 
Amerian Trade &#8212; in former
years several vessels annually
left this Port loaded with Peanuts
but during the past year
only one America vessel the 
"Joseph Nickerson" has visited
this Port loaded with a general
cargo to the value of $9873 32/00
but there being no Pea nuts in
the market she left this Port
<catchwords>bound</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0105.006"/>
bound homewards in ballast.</p>

<p>There has been a panic
in Lisbon which has greatly
affected general business throughout 
this service and much 
anxiety is still felt as to 
the ultimate result of the
crisis. Confidence is lost on 
account of several of the most
important Banks in Lisbon
having suspended payment, and 
it will take time before there
is a renewal of active and 
healthy business.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 
this year large crops were
expected and a good trading 
year confidently looked forward
to &#8212; these hopes have been
<catchwords>completely</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0105.007"/>
completely disappointed. The 
Palm oil crop on which
much of the prosperity of the
Colony depends was very
much smaller than usual.
Cotton, and all Oil seeds
are being brought in to the 
market in very small quantities
and Traders are being left
with heavy stocks of gords prepared
for a large barter
trade &#8212; this lock-up of Capital 
will have grievous results and 
I much fear that this 
season will prove the most
disastrous that the Colony
of Angola has yet encountered.</p>

<p>Coffee has proved a fair 
crop, but this export is 
<catchwords>principally</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0105.008"/>
principally in the hands of
the Planters and a comparatively
small quantity is brought
into the Barter Market to 
relieve stocks.</p>
