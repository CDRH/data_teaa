<note>No 22</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate at
Sierra Leone<lb/>
March 22, 1880.</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst Secty of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the
honor to forward herewith
Duplicate copies of "Commercial
Report for 1879". Ending Dec 31st</p>

<p>I regret that I could not
get information at the 
proper time to enable me
to make said Report as
per Par. 380 of the Consular
Regulations.</p>

<p>This Report is incomplete
in many respects but I have
done the best I could under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>Your attention is specially
called to the fact of Imports and
Exports from and to the United States
being

<pb n="446"/>

respectively 13 per cent
and 8 per cent of the total
Imports and Exports of this
Colony.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the
West Coast of Africa offers
at this time an inviting
field for American Merchants
and Manufactures to
introduce their wares.
In my <sic>Depatch</sic> No 20
dated March 15th to the
Department I <unclear extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> a <unclear>few</unclear>
articles which have been
introduced in this market
during the past year
with good success.</p>

<p>Comprising more <unclear>novelties</unclear> probably
than have been brought to
<sic>to</sic> this market on trial, during 
the past five years.</p>

<p>I have the honor to remain<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant<lb/>
Judson A. Lewis<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<pb n="447"/>

<p>Agriculture.</p>

<p>Is in a very primitive state.
the cultivation of the soil is all
done by hand with stout hoes
as no plough, nor modern implements
of any kind such as
used in the states have ever been
even seen by the natives of this
Colony.</p>

<p>Almost all attention is given to
trading by men, women, and
children and only Ginger, Benniseed,
Ground nuts, Palm Kernals and 
Cola Nuts are raised for Exportation
and <sic>Cassala</sic>, Rice, Sweet Potatoes
and Yams are the principle
vegetables raised for <unclear extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> 
consumption.</p>

<p>The following fruits grow spontaneously
and in great abundance, <sic>Bannanas</sic> 
Mangos, Plantains, Coco nuts, Pineapples,
<unclear>Pracada</unclear> Pears, Oranges,
Limes &amp;c. which are sold about
the streets and markets very cheaply.</p>

<p>There are a few Gentlemen
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="448"/>

of means who are cultivating some
land, for their own satisfaction
but without any great profit thus
far. It is generally thought
by the intelligent portion of the
community, and much is published
in the local papers that
more attention should be paid to
agricultural pursuits and less
to trade.</p>

<p>Of late several public meetings
have been held, committees appointed,
reports submitted and
subscriptions called for to form
a company for the purpose of
establishing a sugar mill and
to encourage the cultivation of
the sugar cane.</p>

<p>This scheme if vigorously
pushed by a couple of Europeans
and a few intelligent natives 
could be <sic>consumated</sic> at this
time, but without this energetic
and persistent push which
is so characteristic of the
<catchwords>American</catchwords>

<pb n="449"/>

American or what is sometimes
termed Yankee - it will end like
all other things of a similar
nature which have been brought
forward for introduction in this 
Colony - failure.</p>

<p>The Committee
appointed to investigate the
feasibility of the sugar cane
business, say in their Report
as follows.</p>

<p>Your committee are
unanimous in the opinion
that the soil in and around 
the Colony of Sierra Leone with
anything like proper attention
and cultivation will produce
the sugar cane successfully.</p>

<p>x x x x</p>

<p>The question of Labor has been
one of considerable <unclear>perplexity</unclear> to
your Committee, but after considerable
discussion and deliberation
it was pretty generally
thought that suitable labor
<catchwords>could</catchwords>

<pb n="450"/>

could without doubt be obtained
and instructed in the work,
by patience and proper payment
of the same.</p>

<p>x x x x</p>

<p>By judicious and proper management
of this said company,
its finances and interests, we
believe the absolute risk to the
shareholder, will be reduced to
the very minimum of any
enterprise which is organized
at the present day
for legitimate business.</p>

<p>x x x x</p>

<p>The report closes as follows</p>

<p>You will not forget
that great streams from
little fountains flow, and that
every large and valuable
enterprise which is successful
to day was once an
untried experiment.</p>

<pb n="451"/>

<p>Education</p>

<p>Receives considerable attention
both from local authorities and
missionary societies in England.</p>

<p>The Fourah Bay College
connected with and under the
<sic>supervission</sic> of the university
of Durham in England.
The Principal and one professor
are white men, balance of
Teachers black. The building
is a large three story brick
and stone structure, on a high
point of land overlooking
the Sierra Leone River about
one mile from town.</p>

<p>Next in order is the Grammar
School, located in "Regent Square"
about half a mile from the 
center of the town, a boarding
school for Boys. next in rank is the
Wesleyan High School
also a boarding school for Boys
next the Model School for
Boys and Girls.</p>

<pb n="452"/>

<p>Most of the Churches have
day schools held either in
their chapels or in buildings
separate from, but under
their <sic>supervission</sic>.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church maintains
two schools, one for boys and
one for girls. All of the
Catholic Clergy and Sisters of
Charity are white persons.
There are quite a number
of private schools for girls
and are attended by the children
of families, who are able to pay
their tuition and prefer to do
so rather than <del>to</del> send to the 
public schools.</p>

<p>There are also two Institutions
for young ladies. One the
"Annie Walsh Memorial School"
which is under the <sic>supervission</sic>
and support of the Church Missionary
Society of England. it 
is a boarding school and the
buildings are quite elaborate
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb n="453"/>

and very comfortable. Enclosed
in grounds of about four
acres: presided over by a 
Preceptress and an Assistant
both white ladies, balance of
teachers native.</p>

<p>The other Institution has just
been opened and is under
the <sic>supervission</sic> of the Wesleyan
Society.</p>

<p>There is an examination held
in all the public schools once
a year and the pupils are
advanced from the Grammar
school to College &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of Churches there are
Seventeen divided as follows:
Eight Methodists, Six Protestant
Episcopal, Two Baptist and
one Catholic Church, besides
several Chapels not included in
the above number, all of these
churches hold regular services
on Sunday and various
meetings throughout the week.</p>

<pb n="454"/>

<p>Harbor &amp;c</p>

<p>The <sic>Habor</sic> with perhaps one
exception (that of St Paul De Loando)
is the best on the West Coast
it is most easily entered
evey by strangers and is
really admirable place for
vessels to anchor only a
few hundred yards from
the "Queens Wharf", which is
solidly built of stone and on 
which several large cranes
are arranged for the hoisting
of all kinds of merchandise
from the Lighters, which are
<unclear extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> by two natives and are
invariably used in unloading
all steamers and sailing vessels.</p>

<p>The landing of all
Merchandise both dutiable and
free is under the immediate
charge of the Landing Surveyor
Mr A. B. Hanson who is
also Deputy Harbor Master
and Superintendent of <unclear>Quarantine</unclear> and

<pb n="455"/>

Lighthouse. These Departments
so far as the head is concerned
are managed with remarkable
promptness and intelligence, 
whose object seems to be to
assist trade rather than
impede it.</p>

<p>The Harbor and Port charges
are as follows viz:</p>

<p>Pilotage inward 5/- per foot
draft - outward half the above
for moving a vessel in the
harbor which must be done
by a Pilot Â£1 - Tonnage dues
1/- per ton. Light dues 3d
Harbor dues Â£3. if vessl is
above 200 tons register.
All Merchandise <unclear extent="one word"/> Lumber
and building material pays a wharfage
tax of 3 pence per cubic
foot - except very heavy
articles which are taxed 10/-
per ton by weighing.</p>

<p>The following <unclear>articles</unclear> are
subject to pay customs duties
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb n="456"/>

as Imports viz:</p>

<p>Tobacco (natural leaf and <unclear>manufactured</unclear>)
Spirits of all Kinds, Powder, and
Guns.</p>

<p>The duty on Tobacco (natural leaf)
is per lb. 4 pence (8 cents)</p>

months on all customs duties of
over Â£20.)</p>

<p>Of the Produce shown
in the tabulated statement herewith
enclosed and marked A.
only the Hides and about 1000,000
pounds of Giner and less than
50,000 lbs of Rubber are
sent to the United States the
balance goes to Europe.
Nearly all the ground nuts a
portion of the Palm Kernals and
Benni Seed go to France the
balance to Liverpool - same
the Cola Nuts which find a
ready market at about Â£60-

<pb n="458"/>

per ton at the Gambia.</p>

<p>The number of American
vessels which have entered and
cleared at this Port during
the year ending Dec. 31st 1879.
was 12 with an aggregate
Tonnage of 3731 tons
Register not including the
United States Flagship
<sic>Toconderoga</sic>.</p>

<p>Imports and Exports.</p>

<p>The total amount of Imports
to this Colony during the year
ending Dec. 31st 1879 was
$1,825,858.10</p>

<p>Exports
$1,397,186.66</p>

<p>Of this amount the Imports 
from the United States for
the same period were
$231,526,78
and exports to the United States
$111,354.98</p>

<pb n="459"/>

<p>The Imports to the United States
being about 13% and the
Exports about 8% of the
total Imports and Exports.</p>

<p>in view of the large number
of American products and
manufactured articles so
admirably adapted to this
market, this is hardly a
satisfactory exhibit of
American intelligence and
enterprise.</p>

<p>This condition of trade
is <sic>susciptible</sic> of great improvement
in favor of the United 
States. I feel <sic>compeled</sic> to make
one charge against the
Manufacturer and merchant
in the states - they seem unwilling
to sell a Single article desired
<unclear>sample</unclear> &amp; for trial (in working
up trade) at the same rate they
would in selling a quantity,
forgetting the important fact
<catchwords>that</catchwords>

<pb n="460"/>

that with a little concession on
their part, the result might prove
greatly to their advantage</p>

<p>I would further suggest to those
parties having goods which
seem adapted to this market
but which have not been
introduced that when they have
an opportunity to consign them
to a responsible person they
do so, <sic>sharring</sic> part of the
risk and await the result.</p>

<p>Ice.</p>

<p>We have no ice either imported
or manufactured - occasionally
we can get a small piece from
the Mail Steamers - on their way 
out from England - but on
their return passage they have
more even for their own
use. On first coming to
this Colony the <unclear>writer</unclear> gave
this subject considerable study
and believed it would pay
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb n="461"/>

to establish an Ice House (in
connection with other business)
and import the ice from the
United States. It might not
pay the first year but afterward
I have no doubt it
would be profitable, as
the people once become
accustomed to its use they
would not readily relinquish
it. The price would no
doubt range from 3 to
6 cents per lb according
to quantity consumed.</p>

<p>In the same vessel with the
ice - could be shipped American
Lard, Butter, Cheese, vegetables
and many things which 
are not almost excluded
from this market on account
of length of passage and
climatic causes.</p>

<pb n="461"/>

<p>Manufactures.</p>

<p>The manufacturing business
of this Colony is so very
limited as to be hardly worth
naming in this report.:</p>

<p>There is no power mill of
any kind in the Colony.
there are a large number
of Cabinet Makers, Tailors,
Watchmakers and Jewelers, Shoemakers
and Blacksmiths
who do the work required
for home use only.</p>

<p>General Observations.</p>

<p>The healthfulness of the Colony
has greatly improved during 
the past 3 or 4 years.
This may be owing to improved
drainage and better sanitary
measures - also to the fact of
the remarkably good water
which is now universally
used by all, being brought
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<gap extent="one page" reason="missing image"/></p>

<pb n="462"/>

<p>Population</p>

<p>The European population
is very small, there seldom
being any time when one
hundred white people can
be counted. There has been
no Census taken for the
past 6 years, but those 
best able to judge estimate
the population at about
40,000.</p>

<p>Climate.</p>

<p>Being in 8Â° north latitude
is of course tropical, but
there is no extreme of
heat. during the past
year the thermometer has
not indicated above 91Â°
and there is usually a fine
sea breeze at least two
thirds of the time. during
the rainy or cool season the
Thermometer does not indicate
lower than 75Â°.</p>

<p>From the middle of May til
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="465"/>

the middle of October is the
<unclear>hot</unclear> season and by reference
to the tabulated statement herewith
enclosed and marked
"B" it will be observed that the
Amount of Rainfall has steadily
and largely increased, during
the past three years, being
for the year 1879. a total
of 168 inches as against
131 inches in 1877 and 163
inches in 1878.</p>

<p>Garrison and Fortifications</p>

<p>There are Soldiers Barracks, Officers
Quarters, Hospital, Commissariat
&amp;c. for the <sic>accomodation</sic> of
one Regiment of troops and
the 1st and 2nd West India
Regiments alternate.
The 2nd Regt. came here the
first part of 1877 and will
leave early in 1880. being
<sic>releived</sic> by the 1st Regt.
Alternating between the West Indies
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb n="466"/>

and Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>This is an important
Military and Naval Point
as the Depot of supplies
is here and it being the
principle coaling station
on the West Coast for all
English Men of War.</p>

<p>Steam Ship Lines.</p>

<p>There are two regular lines of 
Steamers (carrying the mails)
from England going South
as far as Old Calabar and
giving one Steamer each
way weekly. Occasionally 
an opposition line of trading 
Steamers come forward but
up[ to this time, with no great
degree of regularity or persistent
endurance, it has the affect
however of reducing the price
of freights for the time being
as the old companies fight the
new, with energy and regardless
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="467"/>

of present profits.</p>

<p>Quite a number of Steamers
beside sailing vessels belonging
to private parties come out from
France and England on trading
voyages.</p>

<p>By reference to <sic>tibulated</sic> 
statement herewith enclosed and
marked "G" the aggregate tonnage
of vessels entering this Port
during the years 1877, 1878
and 1879 is indicated but
nationality not given but
mostly English and French</p>

<p>Finance and Currency.</p>

<p>There is one Bank in operation
in Sierra Leone, the "Oxford Bank"
owned and managed by private
individuals they cash drafts
draw checks, and loan
money at 18% interest,
though many times charging
as high as 1/- per Â£ per
month, for small sums (60%)

<pb n="468"/>

There are some parties in town
who do a thriving business
in a small way loaning money
in small sums and on short
time at as high a rate of
interest as 2/- per Â£ per
month (120%)</p>

<p>The currency used throughout
the Colony is all
English &amp; French coin together
with Mexican Dollars, the 
latter during the past year
have been imported largely by
private persons, as they can
be purchased in London for
about 3/9 (90Â¢) and pass
readily here for 4/2 (100Â¢)
American money is not
current here and only the
Gold coin passes &amp; that
at a discount.</p>
