<p>United States was not
a contracting party to this
Act, it does not share
still, for its <unclear>vessels</unclear> 
and for its citizens, la
peaceful enjoyment of the
avantages accorded by
the Independent State of the
Congo to everyone
in general.</p>
    
<p> the commerce of
the Independent State of the Congo 
being thus entirely
free, the american <unclear>vessel</unclear>
considered as a vehicle
of transit maybe or a
vessel registered with the
merchant navy of the
United States, or a boat
not registered and belonging
to citizens of the United States,
without this distinction
being able to bring attainment, I insist
on this point, on the
enjoyment of the privilege of
navigation that <unclear>had</unclear>been guaranteed</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>In the one as in
the other case, he has the right 
to display the flag of the
United States.</p>
    
<p>My government
maintains, as a
principal of recognized international
right, that the
<unclear>vessels</unclear> have not only
the faculty to display, wherever
they render themselves,
the flag of the country where
its owners are subjects,
but that in general it is
a duty for them to display
this flag.</p>
    
<p>This principal will be
nevertheless directly combatted
by a disposition that
would oblige the vessels
navigating in the waters of a
particular state to display
the flag of this state,
when these waters are open,
as it is the case here,
to the foreign navigation.</p>
    
<p>It is there the</p>
    
<pb></pb>

<p>sense that appears to have to be
given to the article 2 of the
royal decree of April 30th 1887.</p>
    
<p>This article has for
effect of substituting the flag
of the Indpendent State of the
Congo to the national flag
of the vessel in obliging
this one to display at the back
the flag of the Congo; it
is evident that the flags
of two nations can not
both be deployed at the
same time on the same
pole. This deployment
would denote, in certain circumstances
at least, that
the <unclear>vessel</unclear> is taken by the
nationality which the narrators
are placed the highest.</p>
    
<p>I think that it is a
universal use that the
flag displayed at the back
is that of the nationality
of the vessel.</p>

<p>The last clause of
the article 2 of the decree from the</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>30th of april looks as a
right of the part of the authorities
of the state of the Congo to determine
in which conditions
the vessels can display
their national flag, these
conditions being subordinated
to the possession of the vessel
papers establishing the nationality
of the boats.</p>

<p>My government
supports that it belongs to
each country to determine
for itself the conditions
of the use of flags
aboard its vessels. The rule
of the United States is that the
vessels of good faith belonging
to the citizens of this country
have the right, while they are
abroad, to display the
flag of the United States
some being the papers
that they possess.</p>
    
<p>I am in consequence
charged by my Government</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>to protest against the application
of the article 2 of the decree from the
30th of april 1887 to the vessels
belonging to the citizens
of the United States:</p>
    
<p>1) in that which it obliges these
vessels to display at the back
the flag of the Independent State
of the Congo.The right
to display another flag
than that of their own
nationality is not recognized;</p>
    
<p>2) in that which the right
to enforce their national
flag is subordinated
to the possession of the vessels
papers establishing their
nationality.</p>
    
<p>I grasp......
