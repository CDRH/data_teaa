Department of State. Monrovia June 8th 1888. <unclear/>
Liberia W.C.A
No. 5. -->

Jin (?) <!-- Sir -->
In response to a request emanating
from your Legation I have the honor
to communicate for the information
of your government, the following
particulars relative to the present
outbreak or rebellious attitude assumed by certain of the aboriginal
tribes of the south eastern portion of
the Republic, towards my government 
and which in its opinion constitutes
an emergency or a sufficient reason
for a (*oofieitation) <!-- solicitation --> of the immediate
assistance of the government of the 
United States by means of its naval
forces and otherwise.

About the middle of last year 
the major position <!-- portion --> of the inhabitants 
of Half Cavella (?) <!-- we should look this up -->, a district about 12
miles (oourth*) <!-- south --> of Cape Palmas, began 
to exhibit systems of restlessness 
and a disposition the (*obatravel) <!-- obstruct --> the
execution of, and to disobey the Reneum <!-- Revenue --> <!-- remind me to talk to you about catchwords -->

Row has Z.J. Jaylar <!-- Hon. Chas. -->
U.J. Minister Resident and <!-- U.S. -->
Cououl General <!-- Consul -->
U. J. Legation <!-- U.S. -->
Moluroria. <!-- Monrovia -->

Revenue Laws of the Republic. Efforts
even immediately set on foot by the 
authorities of the County of Maryland 
to alley their manifestations in a <!-- allay -->
peaceful manner, by convoring a <!-- ? -->
council of the adjacent tribes in (cerma*) <!-- compact -->
poet with the government and before 
whom the conduct of the Half Cavalla Tribe
was brought for consideration. The 
council unanimously condems the 
course taken by the Half Cavalla Tribe 
as being improper and disloyal, mule= <!-- ? -->

Led them in a small fine, which
after considerable desowning on the <!-- demurring -->
part of the offenders, was agreed to 
(*low) paid and matters seemed quiet <!-- was? -->
for the present. Towards the closer 
of the year however, this tribe initated 
them to by the intrigues *afoner Julie, a <!-- threats by the intrigues of one Julio, a -->
foreigner and illicit trader, residing 
at sabrvo*, and another British traders setting at defiance our Revenue Laws <!-- Sabro? -- look up -->
at Half Cavalla itself, assumed an 
attitude of open defiance, and insubordination toward the government,
and in spite of repeated efforts on 
the part of the Authorities to induce
them to peacefully *reeider from their <!-- recede? -->
rebellious attitudes, and return to their 
allegiance, have steadfastly refused 
to permit the execution of the laws 
within their district, have origin= <!-- organized -->
aged themselves into an armed force 
fortified  

fortified their villages; and have openly 
declared their intentions to resist by 
force of arms any attempt of the 
government to destroy peace and
order in their districts. They have
also appealed to the British government 
through the governors of its Colonies 
adjacent to the Republic of Liberia 
to be taken under its protector <!-- protectorate, -->
and are now actively ensuring to <!-- endevoring -->
stir up and what more powerful <!-- enlist instead of what -->
tribes as their auxillaries in this
outbreak, so as to assume the 
offensive against the government 
do soon as possible, and have lately <!-- as soon -->
expelled from their (*omnitat) christianze <!-- ? -->
and civilized natives to the number 
of 80 more or less, whose only offense 
was, a decided refusal to fight 
against the government to whom
they had sworn allegiance.

est- is but fair however to (*sthathm) <!-- It --> <!-- state -->
that the British Naval authorities 
on the West Coast have so far
declined affording any aid to these
insurgents, and their <unclear>key info</unclear> have
listens to been exerted on our behalf, <!-- hitherto -->
but the fact that they so not count <!-- do not -->
us faison factors in this, other <!-- primary? --> <!-- matter -->
will atmost be made sufficiently <!-- will I trust -->
clear in the succeeding paragraph
of this despatch.

The effect of these occurences 
has



has been to paralyze lawful commerce
in that portion of the Republic, 
and to gravely embarrass our government. 
It is obvious that if this state of a <!-- affairs -->
fair at Half Cavalla, should continue 
unchecked, a powerful combination 
will soon be formed against the 
government, incited and openly aided 
and abetted* by the foreign traders a= <!-- yes --> <!-- aforesaid -->
foresaid and secretly encouraged by 
certain Foreign favorments, sign a= <!--  governments --> <!-- signatories -->
*stories of the Berlin Conference, who 
for some time past have been in= <!-- intriguing -->
Triguring to obtain possession of this 
position of our territory if not indeed
of the entire territory of the Republic 
The Enclosures B.C.D <!-- See -->

With reference to the points raised 
in Enclosure C. the undersigned would
remain our followers; <!-- as follows -->

1. That Liberia does not contemplate
or project an extension of fourtniers, the <!-- Frontier, -->
territories between the grand cathers and <!-- Grand Craters -->
San pean Riveria having been on in= <!-- San Pean River --> <!-- been an intregral -->
Leqral past of our *sesoritary since <!-- part of our territory -->
the year 1857, Chefor* that penad it <!-- (before that period -->
was comprised in the art* of Mary= <!-- state of Maryland -->
land in Liberia 1834-6, 1846-1950)
and recognised as such by the Sun= <!-- European -->
fear Powers until the era of the 
scramble for Africa".

2. Liberia is neither a European 
Power nor a signatory of the decisions


of the Berlin Conference, she was
not invited to assist in those de= <!-- deliberations -->
liberationa, and is therefore not 
bound by its decisions refer to future acquisitions of African Territory by 
European Powers, and raft to the <!-- ? -->
present possessions or future  acquisitions of an African Party. <!-- State -->

My government declines on these 
grounds to commit suicide, as it 
would do by adopting the course suggested 
by the British of Foreign Affairs in <!-- Office -->
enclosure C. or even for the present to enter
