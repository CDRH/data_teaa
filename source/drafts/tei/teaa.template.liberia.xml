Jin (?)
in response to a request emanating
from your Legation I have the honor
to communicate for the information
of your government, the following
particular relative to the present
outbreak or rebellious attitude as =
oumed(?) by certain of the aboriginal
tribes of the south eastern partion of
the Republic, towards my government 
and which in its opinion constitutes
an emergency or a sufficient reason
for a (*oofieitation) of the immediate
assistance of the government of the 
United States by means of its naval
forces and otherwise

About the middle of last year 
the major position of the inhabitants 
of Half Cavella (?), a distiet(?) about 12
miles (oourth*) of Cape Palmas, began 
to exhibit systems of restlessness 
and a disposition the (*obatravel) the
execution of, and to disobey the Reneum

Row has Z.J. Jaylar
U.J. Minister Resident and
Cououl General 
U. J. Legation
Moluroria. 

Revenue Laws of the Republic Efforts
even immediately set on foot by the 
authorities of the County of Maryland 
to alley their manifestations in a 
peaceful manner, by convoring a 
council of the adjacent tribes in (cerma*) 
poet with the government and before 
whom the conduct of the Half Cavalla Tribe
was brought for consideration. The 
council unanimously condems the 
course taken by the Half Cavalla Tribe 
as being improper and disloyal, mule=

Led them in a small fine, which
after considerable desowning on the
part of the offenders, was agreed to 
(*low) paid and matters seemed quiet 
for the present. Towards the closer 
of the year however, this tribe initates 
them to by the intrigues *afoner Julie, a 
foreigner and illicit trader, residing 
at sabrvo*, and another British traders setting at defiance our Revenue Laws
at Half Cavalla itself, assumed an 
attitude of open defiance, and in = 
subordination toward the government,
and in spite of repeated efforts on 
the part of the Authorities to induce
them to peacefully *reeider from their
rebellious attitudes, and return to their 
alligiance, have steadfastly refused 
to permit the execution of the laws 
within their district, have origin=
aged themselves into an armed forcer 
fortified  

fortified their villages; and have openly 
declared their intentions to resist by 
force of arms any attempt of the 
government to destroy peace and
order in their districts. They have
also appealed to the British government 
through the governors of its Colonies 
adjacent to the Republic of Liberia 
to be taken under its protector 
and are now actively ensuring to 
stir up and what more powerful 
tribes as their auxillaries in this
outbreak, so as to assume the 
offensive against the government 
do soon as possible, and have lately 
expelled from their (*omnitat) christianze 
and civilized natives to the number 
of 80 more or less, whose only offense 
was, a decided refusal to fight 
against the government to whom
they had sworn allegiance.

est- is but fair however to (*sthathm)
that the British Naval authorities 
on the West Coast have so far
declined affording any aid to these
insurgents, and their key info haves
listens to been exerted on our behalf,
but the fact that they so not count 
us faison factors in this, other 
will atmost be made sufficiently 
clear in the succeeding paragraph
of this despatch 

The effect of these occurences 
has been to paralyze lawful commerce
in that partion of the Republic, 
and to gravely embarrass our government. 
It is obvious that if this state of a 
fair at Half Cavalla, should continue 
unchecked, a powerful combination 
will soon be formed against the 
government, incited and openly aided 
and abetted* by the foreign traders a=
foresaid and secretly encouraged by 
certain Foreign favorments, sign a=
*stories of the Berlin Conference, who 
for some time past have been in=
Triguring to obtain possession of this 
position of our territory if not indeed
of the entire territory of the Republic 
The Enclosures B.C.D

With reference to the points raised 
in Enclosure C. the undersigned would
remain our followers;

1. That Liberia does not contemplate
or project an extension of fourtniers, the 
territories between the grand cathers and 
San pean Riveria having been on in=
Leqral past of our *sesoritary since 
the yeat 1857, Chefor* that penad it 
was comprised in the art* of Mary=
land in Liberia 1834-6, 1846-19507
and recognises as such by the Sun=
fear Powers until the era of the 
scramble for Africa".

2. Liberia is neither or European 
Power nor a signatory of the 
Berlin Conference, she was
not invited to assist in those de=
liberationa, and is therefore not 
bound by its decisions refer to future acquire=
sitions of African Territory ny 
European Powers, and raft to the 
present possessions or future  a.c=
quisitions of an African Party.

My government declines on these 
grounds to commit suicide, as it 
would do by adapting the course suggested 
by the British of Foreign Affairs in
enclosure C. or even for the present to enter
