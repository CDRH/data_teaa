Subject::
Departure from Stanley Pool and arrival at 
Stanley Falls. Movements of State Troops
against rabs</ab>
    
<pb facs="20170614_143443"/>
<p>To the Honorable 
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.

Sir:
I have the honor to inform you of any de-
parture from Stanley Pool Febuary 9th
and arrival at this place March 9th.
The situation there is extremely interesting 
as the State has began to war against
The Arabs who occupy the government ter-
ritory to the Eastward of the red line marked
on the enclosed charts.</p>    
<p>In the South Lieuteniant Dhanis Commisonary 
of the Kassai District with headquarters at 
Lousanho Lav with him six thousand men
eight hundred State soldiers and five thous-
and natives under the command of Kongo
Lutete a former slave of Tippo Libs but
who declared hundred of free and has
thrown his whole force in with the
government. This army is marching to 
Kassongo and Nyangone possibly to 
Lake Tanhanyka where they would once
the hoops of the anti-slave society under
command of Captain Jacques. mr. Shanice
met the grabs near Nyangons under com-
mand of Seffon. (a don of Tippo Tibs)
and gained a victory killing one thousand
men and capturing twelve hundred garo.
The next day the town was captured and 
the his/ Manci Moharra + his son 
killed and seffon badly wounded. He is
now on his way to Kassongo, after what</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_143457"/>
<p>his movements are uncertain. This two
Arab chiefs killed at Nyangoute were
the ones who massacered Mr. Hausters
expedition last year between Bena
Kamba and Riba Riba. In the month 
of December. They also killed the two
State officers who had been their
prisoners for nine months in Kassongo.
An expedition consisting of two large
river steamers and one thousand one
leaves Eavoke this month toco-peperto
with Mr. Dhanis using Bepa Kamba as
a face of supplies. This force goes down
the Lomami River, and to under the 
command of commandante Charltain.
He has been King enough to ask ome
to accompany him as his guest and
I have accepted the invitation.</p>
    
<p>This most aggressive action against 
the Arabs has been taken in accord-
ance with chapter I article I para-
gratho 2. and 6. of the General
Act of Brussels for the oppression
of the slave trade.</p>
    
<p>The Arabs are gradually forcing them-
selves to the Westward and are not
hunting slaves in the Loptori Tschonapa and 
Loukenye Rivers. The captured negroes
are used as money to purchase ivory
and if the ivory is sent to the East
Coast they are sold to dealers from the 
North.</p>
  
<p>It is impossible for one to write lengthy 
reports on the subject white I am to 
constantly on the move, but I have
been keeping a journal in which every thing
of interest I have so far see is noted
and when I finish shall write out a 
free report and present it to</p>
