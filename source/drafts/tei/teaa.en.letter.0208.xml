Microcopy No. T-438 DESPATCHES FROM UNITED STATES CONSULS IN SIERRA LEONE, 1858-1906 Roll 1 Volume 1 February 22, 1858- March 28,1881 THE NATIONL ARCHIVES NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS SERVICE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Washington: 1960 Vol. 1 Sierra Leone Feb. 22, 1858 June 30 1882

You will at once see Sir, that the position which I now hold <!-- as Acting Consul --> an Acting for and <unclear/> <!-- unclear word is without --> appointment from the United States Government, but merely by the nomination of the Commodore before-named invests me in strict <!-- law --> land with no actual legal authority. I am recognized as Acting counsul by the local Government, as it <!-- seems --> became to me, merely through courtesy, <unclear/> <!-- unclear word is and --> I cannot close my eyes to the fact, that, had I attempted to make any stand in opposition to the Government in recent <!-- cases --> cares of aggresion by British <!-- Cruizers --> Congress on American Vessels in the Court, any further recognition whatever of me even through <unclear/> <!-- unclear word is courtesy --> would have at once ceased. 

As you are aware, the several vessels seized on the <!-- Coast --> Court on the alleged ground of being engaged in the Slave Trade are all <!-- sent --> sint to the Colony for adjudication, or, I should rather observe for condemnation.

I stake the liberty of enclosing for your inspection a List of the Prizes taken by <!-- H. R. Majestys Cruizers --> A.B. Majesty </unclear> and sent into this <!-- Port --> Govt. I will also mention that during the period I have been Acting Counsel <!-- there? --> thus have arrived in this <!-- Port --> Govt no fewer than 120 American Vessels
