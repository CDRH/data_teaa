REC'D.
MAY 18 1896
DEPT OF STATE</add></p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia, April 7, 1896.</p>

<p>Mr. Beverly Y. Payne,
to the Department of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Complaint of O. A. Datow, Master
of American Barkentine "D. A. Brayton"</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2141.jpg"/>

<p>No 15.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States
Monrovia, Liberia, April 7, 1896.</p>

<p>Honorable Edwin F. Uhl,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington D. C.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to inclose
a copy of a letter from the
Master of the American Barkintine
"D. A. Brayton" of Boston, owned
by John F. Brooke, General
Merchant and trader on the
Gold Coast, relating to an
incident which occurred between
Master of said Barkintine, and
the Commander of H. M. S.
"Blone" near Accra, Gold Coast
on March 2nd last.</p>

<p>The original of the enclosed copy
has just reached this Consulate
General from the Consular
Agent at Elmina.
I have</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2142.jpg"/>

<p>I have the honor to be
Sir:
your obedient servant.</p>

<p>Beverly Y. Payne,
Vice Consul General</p>

<p>Inclosure.</p>

<p>1. Copy of letter from O. A.
Datow to Consular Agent Eminsang</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2143.jpg"/>

<p>Accra, March 3rd 1896</p>

<p>U. S. Consular Agent,
Elmina</p>

<p>Sir:
I wish to call your attention to an
incident which happened to me in the
Am. Bkt "D. A. Brayton" of Boston.
We Left Winnebah on Monday, March 2nd
bound for Accra, which sailing down the
Coast and about fire miles from Accra,
in could see a vessel in the distance
off shore, perhaps 8 or 10' miles away,
and which I took for a telegraph ship.
About half hour after, the make came
to me and said that the steamer was
coming towards us and looked like a
Man of War. I told him to hoist the
ensign, which he did, and lowered the <unclear>mizzen</unclear>
top said showing our colors plainly.</p>

<p>I saw he had signals up. The Steamer
was H. M. S. "Blonde." She crossed our
stern with signals still flying, and came
around on our loc quarter.
Thinking him a stranger, asking information, I
hailed him by saying I was sorry, but we had
no signals. He replied by asking why we
did not hoist our colors, I replied, we</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2144.jpg"/>

<p>had, and be said. Why not before? I told
him we did not hoist our colors to every
ship which might pass 10 miles or so
out to sea, but only to vessels which
ever way, we be said in ought to, and
I replied that I did not agise with him,
whereupon he seemed very angry, and
said if he heard any more insolence
he would move us hear to, I would
not reply to his insolence, and he
steamed away. What I wish to know
is, Can any British Man of War
come along side a merchantman
belonging to a friendly Power in time
of peace, and use threats of such
a nature, for every one knows that
a ship is forced to hear to by a
shot being fired across her bows,
and if she does not comply, the next
one is supposed to go into her.
Not only was the language used
by the Captain totally uncalled for,
but his tone too was most aggressive.
I wish you to forward this
to the Consul General and ask him
to forward to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>I have written Mr. Brooks, enclosing
a copy of this, and asked him to</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2145.jpg"/>

<p>forward to Washington.</p>

<p>I remain
Yours Respectfully
O. A. Datow
Master of Bark - D A "Brayton"</p>
