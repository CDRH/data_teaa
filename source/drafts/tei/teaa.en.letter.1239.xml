<p>Inclosure.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2143.jpg"/>

<p>Accra, March 3rd 1896</p>

<p>U. S. Consular Agent,
Elmina</p>

<p>Sir:
I wish to call your attention to an
incident which happened to me in the
Am. Bkt "D. A. Brayton" of Boston.
We Left Winnebah on Monday, March 2nd
bound for Accra, which sailing down the
Coast and about fire miles from Accra,
in could see a vessel in the distance
off shore, perhaps 8 or 10' miles away,
and which I took for a telegraph ship.
About half hour after, the make came
to me and said that the steamer was
coming towards us and looked like a
Man of War. I told him to hoist the
ensign, which he did, and lowered the <unclear>mizzen</unclear>
top said showing our colors plainly.</p>

<p>I saw he had signals up. The Steamer
was H. M. S. "Blonde." She crossed our
stern with signals still flying, and came
around on our loc quarter.
Thinking him a stranger, asking information, I
hailed him by saying I was sorry, but we had
no signals. He replied by asking why we
did not hoist our colors, I replied, we</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2144.jpg"/>

<p>had, and be said. Why not before? I told
him we did not hoist our colors to every
ship which might pass 10 miles or so
out to sea, but only to vessels which
ever way, we be said in ought to, and
I replied that I did </p>
