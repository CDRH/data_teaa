<note>Copy</note>

<p>Accra, March 3rd 1896.</p>

<p>U. S. Consular Agent<lb/>
Elmina</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I wish to call your attention to an
incident which happened to me in the
Am. Bkt "D. A. Brayton" of Boston.</p>

<p>We Left Winnebah on Monday, March 2nd
bound for Accra. Which sailing down the
Coast and about five miles from Accra,
we could see a vessel in the distance
off shore, perhaps 8 or 10 miles away,
and which I took for a telegraph ship.
About half hour after, the mate came
to me and said that the steamer was
coming towards us and looked like a
Man of War. I told him to hoist the
ensign, which he did, and lowered the mizzen
top said showing our colors plainly.</p>

<p>I saw he had signals up. The Steamer
was H.M.S. "Blonde". She crossed our
stern with signals still flying, and came
<del>across</del> around on our lee quarter.
Thinking him a stranger, seeking information, I
hailed him by saying I was sorry, but we had
no signals. He replied by asking why we
did not hoist our colors, I replied, we

<pb n="Roll6-2144.jpg"/>

had, and he said. Why not before? I told
him we did not hoist our colors to every
ship which might pass 10 miles or so
out to sea, but only to vessels which
were near, <del>we</del> he said we ought to, and
I replied that I did not agree with him,
whereupon he seemed very angry, and
said if he heard any <hi rend="underline">more</hi> <hi rend="underline">insolence</hi>
he would make us heave to. I would
not reply to <hi rend="underline">his</hi> insolence, and he
steamed away. What I wish to know
is, Can any British Man of War
come along side a merchantman
belonging to a friendly Power in time
of peace, and use threats of such
a nature, for every one knows that
a ship is forced to heave to by a
shot being fired across her bows,
and if she does not comply, the next
one is supposed to go into her.
Not only was the language used
by the Captain totally uncalled for,
but his tone too was most aggressive.
I wish you to forward this
to the Consul General and ask him
to forward to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>I have written Mr. Brooks, enclosing
a copy of this, and asked him to

<pb n="Roll6-2145.jpg"/>

forward to Washington.</p>

<p>I remain<lb/>
Yours Respectfully<lb/>
(sd) O. A. Datow<lb/>
Master of Bakt D. A. Brayton</p>
