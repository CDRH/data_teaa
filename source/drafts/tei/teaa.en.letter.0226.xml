Memorandum of the Liberian Government 
on the Anglo-French Agreement concerning 
the delimitation of their respective boundraies on
the West Coast of Africa and the Soudan**.

The Liberian Government having been made 
cognisant of the said agreement, submits the 
following propositions thereon:

Considering that the districts commprising its 
south eastern territory situated between Cape Palmas 
and the San Pedro River were included within
the limits of the State of Maryland in Liberia 
as far back as the years 1835-50, and that no
counter claime was set up at that time by any
European State.

Considering also that the State of Maryland 
in Liberia was peacefully incorporated with the 
Republic of Liberia in the year 1854, that said
uicorporation* was then and there published to 
the world, and that no protest against it was made
by any European State, that therefore said 
uicorporation* has had thr santion and 
acknowledgement of the civilized world for nearly half a century
and that it is only within the last six years that 

any

any claim to said territory have seen preferred 
by the Government of France.

Considering also that these territories are 
responsible for a portion of the Foreign debt of the 
Republic.

Considering also that Ameries* Liberian 
nuiuous* and schools have in the past and are
at present established in they said districts
and up the Cavalla River.

Considering also that the Map of Africa
precisely published by the Royal Geographical Soverign of Belgium 
shows, the proposed interior boundray of the 
Republic at its greatest width at Roporo, in 
the Condo country, which would only give 
the Republic an interior extent of about 40
miles; and that the whole of the Condo 
Country was formally ceded to the Republic 
by King Momonu how in the year 1868-69

Considering also that the countries between
Monrovia* and the interior slope of the 
Western Mandings plateau were explored by 
Benjamin Anderson at the instance of the 
Liberian Government during the years 1868, 1873,
and 1874 and confirmed to the Republic by 
Special Treaties, and are now set down in

the

the French map of that region as unexplored and 
therefore liable become a prosectorate* of France.

Cosidering also that the present or prospection
delimitation according to the Map referred to, 
would cut off or separate from the Republic of all access to
the River Niger, contray to the Winterland* doctrine 
now acknowledged in, Europe as binding with
respect to European acquistions on the African Continent.

Considering also, that the Republic of Liberia 
is not a European State but was an Independent,
African Government in existence long
before the era of the Berlin Conference and 
was in possession of said territory at a period
considerably interior to the conveying of said
Conference, and was not invited to participate 
in its deliberations, and ought not therefore to
be bound by the rules there at preseriled* for the
conduct of European Powers in Africa, and that 
the Republic seeks only that territory which 
has, for so long at period been acknowledged to 

rightfully

rightfully belong to her,and the right of 
her Winterland.*

For the above reasons the Republic 
considers that her boundraies ought in 
all right and justtice to extend form the 
Mannah River, on the South to the San
Pedro River on the South, and inferior wars 
from the Sea coast to the River Niger in 
accordance with the Riterland* law. This,
regulation of her boundraies would be of 
very little moment to the European States
who have acquired such extensive Empires
in Africa, but is of vital importance to
the Republic of Liberia, and would further 
more sufficently meet her just aspirations.

The Republic therefore protest against 
the conclusion of the said Agreement, so 
far as the deprivation of Liberian 
territory by France is concerned, and solicits
the good offices of the United States Government
to overt his impendening loss of 
territory on her sea board and interior.

E.T.Beverly*
Monrovia 
May 6, 1891
