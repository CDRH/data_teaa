<p>No. 13.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the U.S.,<lb/>
Monrovia, La., Apr. 23d 1879</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Smyth to the Ass't Sec'y of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>The laws passed by the Liberian Legislature at its session of 1878-1879.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>

<p>With special reference to the following acts, the Coffee act; an act incorporating the Order of African Redemption; an amendatory duty act with reference to the payment of the National Debt; a specific duty act; and an act <sic>act</sic> authorizing the President to locate immigrants.</p>

<p>No. 13.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the U.S.,<lb/>
Monrovia, La., Apr. 23d 1879</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to call your attention to the following Acts of the Legislature of the Republic of Liberia for 1878-1879-which were passed by that body.</p>

<p>I did not in sending a copy of the Acts under the date Apr. 21st, call special attention to any of them, which might be of interest to citizens of the mercantile class or others of the U.S.; and I therefore take occasion to do so now.</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon F. W. Seward,<lb/>
Ass't Sec'y of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-2134.jpg"/>

The delay in forwarding the copy was due to the tardiness in their publication and issuance. I did not receive a copy from the Dep't of State until the 21st of April, although the Legislature adjourned in Jan'y.</p>

<p>An act was passed establishing and fixing an export duty on Coffee scions and dried Coffee. For seed Coffee hulled, green or dried there shall be a duty of $1.50 per bushel, unhulled each bushel 50¢, on each scion 5¢, trees whether bearing berries or not 50¢, and on all dried and clear Coffee for table use or purposes To ¼ per lb.</p>

<p><catchwords>An</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2135.jpg"/>

An act to create and incorporate a philanthropic Order to be styled "The Liberian Humane Order of African Redemption." The object of the above named order is to create a revenue for the civilization of African tribes within and in the neighborhood of Liberia by the admission to membership and the sale of a decoration or insignia; and the proceeds to be appropriated to the object mentioned.</p>

<p>An amendatory act, regulating the payment of duties whereby provision is made for the payment or liquidation of foreign <catchwords>claims</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2136.jpg"/>

claims, contracted in a foreign country, was passed.</p>

<p>The passage of this act is the nearest approach to anything like a direct, material recognition of our claim for Ordnance, &amp;c., &amp;c., sold the Liberian government. And the amount likely to be realized by the U.S. as creditor at the close of the next Liberian fiscal year, will not amount to one year's interest on the claim or debt, I apprehend, as the act appropriates but one tenth of the to-be-collected revenue arising from Imports; and this is to be disbursed in payment of all foreign claims, and the English claim is far in <catchwords>excess</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2137.jpg"/>

excess of ours.</p>

<p>An act repealing portions of an act authorizing specific duties on imports, was passed. The articles dutiable, and the amount of duties, are enumerated at length, and I send by this mail to the Secretary of the Treasury a detailed statement of the text.</p>

<p>An act authorizing the President to locate immigrants, was also passed. In whatever spirit this act may have been conceived, if enforced, it will take from the immigrant his personal liberty of selecting any county of the Republic in which he may elect to reside, and <catchwords>without</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2138.jpg"/>

without his consent, and will give the right of a freeman to the President, to be exercised according to his caprice.</p>

<p>The object of this act may be as some Liberians allege, purely political.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obd't serv't,<lb/>
Jno. H. Smyth,<lb/>
U.S. Consul General.</p>
