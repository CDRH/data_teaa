Hon. Secretary of State:

Dear Sir,

<p></p>My duties call me 
again to Gaboon, Africa. We expect to sail
from New York via Liverport, Eng. the 
last of this month.
I shall be very glad to write any 
special instructions from you addressed 
to 23 Centre SL.N.Y. or I will go to Washington
if necessary.

<p></p>The situation there as appears to 
one and our fellow missionaries seem 
to warrant French aggression and accession 
of territory and I firmly believe 
that they will not use content until 
the Congo country is under their control.
In where of this I have felt
that it myself be will for our government

<pb sacs="20170615_145258"

to send to Gaboon someone who might 
give his whole attention to this matter
and while in this country have been 
on the look out for some one who
I could recommend. <p></p>A few weeks 
ago I met a young man, whom I 
formerly knew in college, a young 
man of plishing christian charade
and mankind ability, who expressed 
himself of willing to spend a few 
years there. I therefore recommend 
Royal F. King, nephew of Hon. William
King of Minnesota, either for the 
position with which you have honor 
me, which I will gladly resign and 
accept the Vice Commercial Agency 
or to any position you might sufice
to appoint him. He has seem
some service, under the Department 
of the Interior, among the Indians
where the temptations +young male 
are similar to those on the coast 
and I therefore recommend him

<pb facs="20170615_145449"
as a tried and bare" can this 
address is Dubith Minnesota and 
if he should receive an appointment 
he could be ready to start for Africa 
within three months.

<ab></ab>I have the honor to remain 
Your obedient Servant 
Graham C. Campbell
U.S. Commercial Agent 
of Gaboon West Africa.

P.S. There are needed of the Agency nearly 
all the blank forms necessary in making 
our a ships papers a common 
of Stationary and two flags one,
about a 12th flag for the flag pole 
and a small one for the boat 
about 4th  on length.

Graham C. Campbell
