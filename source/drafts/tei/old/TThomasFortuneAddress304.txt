<title>The Nationalization of Africa*</title>

<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. President, and Ladies and Gentlemen of the Congress:</hi></p>
<p>. . . The map of <placeName>Africa</placeName> is no longer a Chinese puzzle. Its geographical 
mysteries have been solved. Its mighty lakes and rivers have
been traced to their source, and fiction and cupidity have unlocked
hordes of treasure by the side of which that of <name type="person">King Solomon's</name> mines
was as the vastness of the <geogName>Atlantic's</geogName> waste of waters to the smallest
stream that, like a silver thread, wanders down the mountain side and
sighs itself away into the sands of the desert. Railroads are spanning
its immense distances, steamboats are navigating its waterways, and
the electric wire has brought it into talking distance with <placeName>Europe</placeName>
and <placeName>America</placeName>. Its limitless agricultural and mineral resources are being 
developed for the comfort and the happiness of mankind. Vast
States have sprung into being, as if by magic, controlled by European 
colonists, so that already a <country>South African</country> confederacy has
worked its way into the brain of <rs type="person">Cecil Rhodes</rs>, whose empire is
cemented with more human blood and tears than the East Indian
empire wrenched into the British Government by the crimes of <rs type="person">Lord
Clive</rs> and <rs type="person">Warren Hastings</rs>.</p>
<p>Never in the history of mankind has a continent been so rapidly
subdued and its waste places made the habitation of civilized governments 
and its savage inhabitants brought into contact and under
the control of civilization. More has been accomplished along these
lines in Africa in the past quarter of a century than was accomplished
by European colonists in America in the first one hundred and fifty
years of their desperate struggles here to subdue the <sic>aborgines.</sic>
Steam and electricity and gunpowder are responsible for this phenomenon. 
They are conquering forces against which no other forces can
prevail. The savage, with his primitive weapons of defense, falls before 
them as the mists vanish before the all-powerful and all-searching
rays of the sun. He must relinquish his sovereignty and his wealth

of all sorts when these forces confront him. The heroism of the
Ashantee or the Zulu warrior, fighting in defense of his fireside and
his country, is wasted when his assagai is opposed to the maxim
gun or Winchester rifle, or even the old Colt's revolver. We have seen
this in the subjugation of the North American Indians, and we are
now witnessing it in the case of the Africans.</p>
<p>The extent to which the continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName> has been spoliated
and delimitated by Europeans is shown in the fact that of 11,360,000
square miles of territory, all of it has been absorbed or is claimed
except the 9,700 square miles controlled by <country>Liberia</country> on the west coast.
<country>France</country> and <country>Great Britain</country> have already made efforts to absorb this
residium, and we have no reason to suppose that when they get
ready to absorb it and resolve it into a colony they will not do so.
In the philosophy of our civilization might makes right in practice,
however much we may disclaim it in theory. In this, as in many other
of the Christian virtues, our precept and our example are radically
at war.</p>
<p>If the conquest of <placeName>Africa</placeName> shall proceed in the next seventy-five
years as it has done in the past twenty-five, the whole continent will
be as completely under European control, after the lapse of a
century, physically and mentally and morally, as it is possible for
conquerors to impose their conditions upon the conquered. The
vast population of <placeName>Africa</placeName> will be brought under Christian influences
in new forms of government and habits of thought and of conduct.
The whole life of the people will be revolutionized. Ancient beliefs
and superstitions and tribal relations and dissimilarity of vernaculars 
will, in the course of time, be transformed entirely. The demoralizing 
heterogeneousness which now prevails over the whole continent 
will give place to a pervading homogeneity in language, in
religion, and in government.</p>
<head>WHAT  WILL BE  THE RESULT IF AFRICANS ARE BROUGHT
UNDER  CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE?</head>
<p>The physical and mental forces now dissipated in tribal wars, in
savage methods of industry, will give place to peaceful administration 
of government and to concentrated methods of industry. The
nationalization of the continent will proceed along these lines as
naturally and as surely as did that of <country>Great Britain</country> and <country>Ireland</country>,
and as did the <placeName>Germanic States</placeName> under the masterful direction of
<rs type="person">Kaiser William</rs>, <rs type="person">Prince Bismarck</rs> and <rs type="person">Count von Moltke</rs>. Experience,
<fw>305</fw>


<fw>APROPOS OF AFRICA</fw>
as the great Virginian proclaimed, is the only light by which we can
be guided in a matter so speculative. We can reason only by analogy.
Human development proceeds along a straight line.</p>
<p>A common habitation, a common language, a common religion,
are the necessary bases of homogeneous citizenship and of autonomous 
government. They are not possible without these. No
government has successfully prevailed without them. It may be that
Rome, whose legions overran the world, failed in the end because
of the too rapid absorption of alien races possessing dissimilar
languages and religions. Absorption was too rapid for proper assimilation, 
and the mistress of the world perforce died of strangulation. 
And what a fall was there when <q>"the Niobe of nations"</q>, borne
down by the massiveness of its own strength, torn by dissensions
from within and surrounded by barbarous hordes from without, her
proud eagle, which had circled over the nations of the earth, plucked
of his pinions, lay prostrate in the dust, even as Milton's arch fiend
which had braved the host of heaven. When so great a giant among
the nations of the earth can fall to so low an estate as to furnish the
nations of the earth with bootblacks and fruit-venders and organ-grinders, 
what nation, what people can hope to escape the handwriting 
on the wall, however vaunting their pride, however herculean
their strength? Pride goes before a fall, and death lurks in the frame
where health is accounted a heritage. <q>"Oh, why should the spirit of
the mortal be proud!"</q></p>
<p>The surface of the earth is capable of sustaining so many people.
The population of the earth today is very little greater than it was a
century ago. It will be but a little greater a century hence than it is
now. The pressure of population upon subsistence is insistent and
relentless. The supreme struggle of mankind is one of life, of subsistence, 
of preventing death by starvation or exposure. All other
objects of life are subordinated to this one. It is the sleepless agent of
colonization. It has penetrated the utmost bounds of the globe. It
has wrenched from the weak their fertile valleys and luxuriant hillsides; 
and when they have protested, when they have resisted, it has
enslaved them or cut their throats. It has invented all weapons of
defence and of offence. It has invented all the machinery to increase
the productivity of effort at a minimum cost, of whatever sort.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, but natural that the congested population of
Europe should seek an outlet in <placeName>North and in South America</placeName> and
the islands of the sea and in <placeName>Asia</placeName> and in the <placeName>Australias</placeName>; and it is but
natural that the same congested population, in the desperate pursuit 
of something to eat and something to wear, should now be
<fw>306</fw>
<fw>NEGRO SELF-IDENTITY  AND  PAN-AFRICANISM</fw>
seeking an outlet in the virgin continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, whose vast areas
of territory and hordes of population have been the despair of
geographers and ethnologists and philologists and antiquarians
alike. The book of mystery having been unlocked, mankind has made
indecent haste to master its contents. No fear of burning sun and
expansive wastes of deserts and savage beasts and black men, the
fabled genii of the Arabian Nights' entertainment, has deterred
them. They are plunging into the forests and the sandy deserts,
braving the deadly miasmas, more fatal than "an army with
banners", fearful that the pearl of great price shall escape them. If
we are to give credence to the doleful croakings of many ravens in
this country, we should stand in wonderment and awe at the spectacle 
of caravan after caravan of white men and white women, the
flower of Europe's children, winding in a long procession into the
black continent, ultimately to impose their civilization upon the
continent and to mingle their blood with that of the 300,000,000
children of the sun, the despised black children of the family of races.
Their conduct should be inexplicable to these ravens, who insist that
black blood and white blood will not mix, although it has so far
done so in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> and the <country>United States</country>, that these countries
have a yellow streak running through them so thick and so long that
only those hopelessly inflicted with blindness fail to see it and to
properly account for its existence and to deduce from it the fact that
reason, sympathy, affection, and not the color of the skin or texture
of the hair, are the tests of the brotherhood, of the unity, of the
human race.</p>
<p><q>"Skins may differ, but affection
Dwells in black and white the same."</q></p>
<p><placeName>Europe</placeName> will continue to pour its hungry and ambitious and adventurous 
children into the continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName> in the future as in the
past, but there will come a time when self-preservation will dictate a
restriction or cessation of the infusion. But even before that time shall
have been reached, the white races of <placeame>Europe</placeName> who are now subduing
savage tribes and laying the foundation of empires upon the ruins of
savage villages and imposing their yoke upon the natives, their
language and their religions and their forms of governmental
administration and their system of commerce and industry—-even
now the European minority in <placeName>Africa</placeName> are beginning to be absorbed
and assimilated by the vast black majority. This is inevitable. A
minority race in contact with a majority race is doomed to absorption 
and assimilation. It is the primal element of nationalization.

<fw>APROPOS OF AFRICA</fw>
The minority race must exterminate the majority or be exterminated
or absorbed by it. This is an iron law. It has been verified in the
history of every race and of every nation. It will be verified in the
history of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. It will be impossible for <country>France</country> to recover <placeName>Alsace</placeName>
and <placeName>Lorraine</placeName> because the population has become Germanized in
blood and language and religion. The minority Frank has been
absorbed and assimilated by the majority Teuton, even as the invading 
and conquering Saxon minority was by the conquered Angle
majority, and even as the imported and enslaved African black is
being absolved by the heterogeneous white races of the United
States. The inevitable destiny of the European whites in <placeName>Africa</placeName> is
absorption and assimilation by the African blacks as surely as the
ultimate destiny of the African blacks in the <country>United States</country> is
absorption and assimilation by the American whites. I know that to
many this is an abhorrent view of the question, but we are dealing
with the philosophy of recorded history and the invariable laws of
human conduct and not with the prejudices of men. Men are
governed by the laws regnant in their environment. They do not make
the laws; they cannot control them. If they do not like them, they are
free to take themselves into a more congenial atmosphere. If the
whites of America did not want to absorb the blacks, they should
have left them in <placeName>Africa</placeName>; if the European whites do not want to be
absorbed and assimilated by the blacks they should remain out of
Africa. The matter is a very easy one to decide before the first step
is taken; beyond that point it is controlled by "the divinity that
shapes our ends, rough hew them as we may". The rigid laws and
rules and regulations already adopted by the English, the Germans,
the French and the Belgians in <placeName>Africa</placeName> to keep the natives in their
place will prove as ineffectual to their purpose as such laws and
rules and regulations now prove in the United States. The amalgamation 
of the European in <placeName>Africa</placeName> will proceed as surely towards the
development of a national type of man as the amalgamation of alien
races has proceeded in the United States for two centuries towards
the same end. Here we absorb and assimilate the Indian, the European, 
the Asiatic and the African and grow strong in mental and
physical prowess in the process. Indeed, our national strength is to
be found in the homogeneity of its heterogeneous race elements, in its
common language and in its common religion. The nationalization
of <placeName>Africa</placeName> will proceed along the same lines as that of the United
States is proceeding. What manner of man will be evolved from the
process, what sort of national power he will represent, we are already
able to judge, inferentially, by the results being worked out in the
<fw>308</fw>
<fw>NEGRO SELF-IDENTITY AND PAN-AFRICANISM</fw>
nationalization of the people of the United States. The intermingling
of so many race elements work for national and spiritual and material
strength in <placeName>Africa</placeName> as it has done in all the instances with which history
has concerned itself.</p>
<p>I believe that the nationalization of <placeName>Africa</placeName> will be along English
lines, as that of the <country>United States</country>, in its language, from the basic
point of view, in its system of government and in its religion. The
English language is the strongest of all languages, the most elastic
in its structure, the most comprehensive in its use as a vehicle of
human thought and expression. The English system of civil government 
is the best that has been devised, because it allows the greatest
possible freedom to the citizen consistent with the safety of the state.
The Christian religion is destined to supplant all other religious
systems of belief, because it is the best code of moral philosophy ever 
given to man as an inspiration or as a development, an evolution of
the social life of a people.</p>
<p>The English-speaking people are <sic>to-day</sic> the strongest force in
<placeName>Africa</placeName>, from the European point of view. They will disappoint the
truth of history if they do not ultimately effect a confederation of
all the other European forces, including the native forces comprised
in each of them. They will be forced into this federation in self-defence, 
as the American colonists were. History repeats itself. The
nationalization of the African confederation which is a foregone
conclusion from the facts in the case, will be the first step toward
bringing the whole continent under one system of government.
Language and religion may not produce a homogeneous people, as
stated by the <abbr type="title">Hon.</abbr><rs type="person"> John H. Smythe</rs> yesterday, but habitat, language,
and religion will do it in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, as they are doing it in the <country>United
States</country>.</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Book that <country>Ethiopia</country> shall stretch forth her
hand to God. Is it in the power of men to make of no effect the divine
prophecy? Perish the thought. There shall yet be evolved out of the
conflicting race elements on the continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName> a civilization
whose glory and whose splendour and whose strength shall eclipse
all others that now are, or that have gone before into the shadows,
locked in "the double night of ages", from which no traveler returns
in gladness or in sorrow.</p>
