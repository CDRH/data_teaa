<head type="main">The Latest Phase of the Congo Question</head>

<head type="sub">Important Reforms Decreed and Put into Operation.</head>

<p>The Congo question has entered upon a new phase. The conditions
prevailing in the Free State have been investigated by a
commission whose honesty and integrity have been acknowledged
even by the bitterest enemies of the Congo Government.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Commissioners was:</p>

<p>1. That the charges against the Congo Administration had
been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p>2. That in certain instances the Congo Government had been
guilty of negligence, but that, taking it all in all, the administration
compared favorably with the government of the colonies of
other powers in Africa.</p>

<p>3. That a number of administrative reforms should be put in
operation as soon as possible -- especially that the labor-tax should
be more strictly supervised and equitably levied and that the use
of "capitas" (armed native overseers) should be prohibited to
concessionary companies. These were the two defects in' the
Congo Administration which had given rise to most of the criticisms
against the Government.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June, 1906, King Leopold issued twenty-five
Decrees carrying out the recommendations of the Commission of
Inquiry.</p>

<p>These Decrees cover all the points on which the Administration
has been criticized. They provide, among other things, for
the extension of the judicial system, for additional grants of land
to natives; above all they regulate the labor-tax and abolish the
use of capitas or armed native sentries.</p>

<p>It is a large undertaking to put these reforms into operation
throughout the whole territory of the <placeName key="riv.con" n="mapped"><geogName type="river">Congo</geogName></placeName>, which occupies an
area about one-third the size of the United States. Nevertheless
the work has been pushed forward rapidly. Instructions in
regard to disarming the native sentries were issued by the Vice
Governor-General on August 3rd. The instructions in regard
to the labor-tax appeared under date of September 8th. Here
after the State cannot compel the natives to work for any commercial
company. "Henceforth," say the instructions, "the companies 
shall have recourse exclusively to voluntary and paid
labor for the working of their property or concessions."</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the reforms will be carried out
thoroughly and in good faith. In spite of the calumnies put
about by the King's enemies, no one can point to a single concrete 
instance where King Leopold has failed to carry out a promise.
Moreover it is clearly to the commercial and political, as
well as humanitarian, interests of the King and his Administration
to effect reforms which will make the Government run
smoother, and which will make the natives happy and industrious
rather than discontented and rebellious.</p>

<p>The reforms are of a nature to satisfy the native, to satisfy
the Government, and, in fact, to satisfy everybody except the
professional reformers and the well-meaning but misguided members
of religious and philanthropic societies who blindly follow
these professional guides without examining the matter" for themselves.</p>

<p>The professional reformers who continue their campaign
against the Congo are fighting a dead issue. The reforms they
asked for have been granted. If they really want reforms they
now have them. If they want something more they are not acting
in good faith, but are seeking an excuse to destroy the State
like the wolf in the fable who complained that the lamb had
muddied his drinking-pool.</p>

<p>The Accusations Against the Congo.</p>

<p>The accusations against the Congo are chiefly based upon four
kinds of evidence:</p>

<p>1. Stories, partly true and partly false, of a few isolated incidents
which occurred many years ago during the period when 
all the energies of King Leopold's Government were engaged in
putting down the Arab slave-raids, and in the days when the
State was just beginning to set its hand to the task of administering
this immense territory in Darkest Africa.</p>

<p>2. Endless exaggerations and multiplications of those stories,
reminding one of Falstaff's eleven men in buckram suits grown
out of two.</p>

<p>3. Fanciful stories told by natives and accepted by missionaries
as gospel truth, without the slightest attempt at verification.</p>

<p>4. Flat libels.</p>

<p>As an example of old stories, galvanized and still doing duty
as current events may be cited some statements made by the Secretary
of the Boston Congo Reform Association in a magazine just
published (December, 1906). He relates as though it were the
newest piece of gossip an incident described by Mr. Sjoblom.
That incident was first related by Mr. Sjoblom nine years ago,
but it is now served up as something fresh and no date given to
it. It may or' may not be a true story, but its resurrection suggests
that there is a scarcity of fresh "atrocities" in stock.</p>

<p>In the same article the Secretary of the Congo Reform Association
of Boston affirms that "cannibalism exists in spite of the
dictum of the Inquiry Commission," and then proceeds to prove
the prevalence of cannibalism in the present year of grace by
narrating without date an incident that occurred more than ten
years ago.</p>

<p>False stories are often accepted by simple-minded and zealous
clergymen and handed out again with their endorsement and with
the added authority of their names and priestly office. As an
example may be cited the story circulated extensively this summer
on the authority of the Rev. Dr. R. H. Nassau. In June,
1906, a New York paper published the story of an alleged
"atrocity." The article appeared over the signature of the Rev.
Dr. Nassan who seemed to relate the incident as something within
his personal knowledge. The paper, furthermore, stated that
Dr. Nassau had lived 45 years in the Congo Free State. The
Consul-General of the Congo State investigated the case, and
finally obtained from Dr. Nassau a written acknowledgment that
he had never been in the Congo Free State, that he had no personal
knowledge of the incident related so vividly, that it was
simply a story he had read in a book-a book that had been condemned
as a libel more than two years ago by an English Court.</p>

<p>The recklessness of certain missionaries in making accusations
is also shown in the case of the Rev. Mr. Stannard, an 
English missionary, who was in June of this year found guilty of
libel against an officer in the Congo Service.</p>

<p>One of the most daring attempts to damage the Congo Free
State by trumped-up charges was made by Guy Burrows with his
book "The Curse of Central Africa." The book related horrors
which made a deep impression. It was widely used as a campaign
document against the Congo and stories from it are found
in circulation to this day in spite of the fact that in 1904 the book
was condemned as a libel by the Court of King's Bench in London.
It was, moreover, shown at the trial that an effort had been
made to coerce the Congo Government into buying the manuscript
before publication, but the Government refused to yield to
what they considered an attempt to "blackmail."</p>

<p>The Large Majority of Missionaries in the Congo in Favor of the Government.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Congo claim that their views are backed
by the great body of missionaries in the Congo. This claim is
absolutely false.</p>

<p>There are over 500 missionaries out there, Protestant and
Catholic. Out of this number 52 have signed an "Appeal" against
the Administration-in other words, about one missionary in ten
is against the Government.</p>

<p>Of these 52 signers sixteen are wives of missionaries and are
supposed to echo the opinions of their husbands. Thirty-five of
the signers have mission stati0l1s in the district near the coast
and, consequently, do not speak with any authority in passing
judgment on events which- were alleged to have happened in the
interior-apparently they relied on stories told them by others.
One of the signers has his missionary station situated in Portuguese
Africa, and another signer, Rev. Mr. Hensey, arrived in the
Congo for the first time on December 23, 1905 and nineteen days
later signed the appeal condemning the administration of a
country one-third the size of the United States.</p>

<p>The opinion of 52 missionaries, no matter how hastily formed,
should be treated with proper consideration, but the opinion
of the remaining 450 is evidently of much more weight,
and in the documents collected in this pamphlet will be found
extracts from letters which go to show that the large majority of
Congo missionaries uphold King Leopold's rule in Africa and
praise him for the good work he has accomplished.</p>

<p>Among other documents will be found a letter from the principals
of all the Catholic Orders in the Congo, expressing the
.sentiments of their 384 missionaries in repelling the attacks which
have been directed against the Government.</p>

<p>There will also be found at the end of this pamphlet expressions
of opinion from the British Baptist Missionary . Society; Dr.
Samuel P. Verner, a Presbyterian; Rev. W. Millman, of the Baptist
Missionary Society; Rev. Mr. Clarke, and Rev. William
George, English missionaries; Monsignor Van Ronsle,
Apostolic Vicar in the Congo Free State; Monsignor
Roelens, Apostolic Vicar of the Upper Congo; Monsignor
Augouard, Father Maguire, Father Colle, Father Beyen of the
Order of Premontre, and other missionaries who have had long
experience in the Congo. It is true that most of these witnesses
for the Congo are Catholics, but it must be remembered that the
large majority of missionaries out there are of that church.
No Christian, of whatever creed he be, can, for a moment, think
that this noble army of nearly 400 Catholic missionaries who are
laying down their lives for the salvation of Africa, would condone
"atrocities" or uphold and defend a corrupt administration.</p>

<p>Sentiment in Belgium Supports the King's Policy.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Congo, ignoring the opinions of some
400 missionaries who approve the Government, brazenly attempt
to pass off the views of 52 as the unanimous missionary sentiment
in the Congo. In the same way they try to palm off the opinions
of a few socialists and malcontents as the sentiment of the Belgian
Parliament and of the Belgian people. The bluff may go
with some people (particularly when they label a "Christian-Democrat"
as "Catholic and Conservative" or disguise a socialist
as a "Liberal"), but anyone who is at all familiar with Belgium
is aware that Belgian public opinion upholds and approves King
Leopold's administration of the Congo. Go where you will in
Belgium and you will find that the great majority of the Belgian
people, from the most distinguished statesmen down to the small
shop-keeper stand solidly by the King in his colonial enterprise
and speak with both admiration and gratitude of the great work
he has accomplished for Belgium and for civilization in the
Congo.</p>

<p>In the succeeding pages will be found extracts giving the sentiments
of such distinguished members of the Belgian Parliament
as Count de Smet de Naeyer, Monsieur Woeste, Senator Wiener,
and Monsieur Henry Carton de Wiart.</p>

<p>Profits Do Not Go Into King's Pockets.</p>

<p>Some of the "proofs" against the Congo are so ridiculous that
they can hardly be considered seriously. For example the Secretary
of the Boston Congo Reform Association in a recent publication
seriously asserts that as the exports from the Congo exceed
the imports by some $6,000,000 a year, it follows that King
Leopold, "according to his own figures is looting the country to
the extent of about six million dollars a year." It sounds rather
like an argument from "Alice in Wonderland." One could as
well say that because the exports of India exceed the imports by
$100,000,000 a year, England is looting India to the extent of
$1OO,OOO,000, or that she is robbing the Transvaal of fifteen
million dollars annually and the Malay States of a like amount.
The professional reformers of the Congo fear that somebody is
making money out of Central Africa besides themselves -- hence
they call it "loot" and say it goes into the King's pocket. As
usual, they are wrong on both points. There is no "loot" in the
matter and the revenues from the State do not go into the King's
pocket. There is no mystery about the Congo finances. The revenue
from concessions goes to the stockholders of the companies.
The State receives in proportion to the number of shares it holds.
This money figures in the public budget and is used for the
expenses of the Government. Profits from lands managed by the
State are also put into the public budget of the State and likewise
go into the treasury of the State. No public account
is made of the revenue from the Crown Lands, but the money
does not go into the King's pockets. It might reasonably be
expected that the revenue from the Crown Lands should go to the
Crown, but the King has voluntarily renounced personal participation
in this revenue and has with great generosity turned the
whole amount of income from the Crown Lands into a fund for
public improvements in the Congo and in Belgium.</p>

<p>This self-denial on the part of the King does not prevent, his
enemies from making out fanciful balance-sheets for him and
crediting his imaginary account with fabulous amounts. A recent
anti-Congo writer goes so far as to say that the King makes fourteen
million dollars a year out of the Congo which looks like the
statement of a frenzied financier as the whole annual output from
the Congo is only about $10,000,000.</p>

<p>King Leopold gave millions of francs out of his own pocket
to support the Congo in its early days. It was his munificence
that made the existence of the State possible. It was his initiative
and generosity that opened up the country and enabled the missionaries
to carry the Cross to the heart of Africa. He has
watched over the Congo and guarded it and has prepared it as a
rich legacy for Belgium. The Congo is the work of King Leopold's
hands and, as His Majesty recently said, "There can be no
more legitimate and respectable right than the right of the author
to his own work,-the fruit of his labor.</p>

<p>"The Powers assisted at the birth of the new State with benevolence,
but not a single one of them was asked to participate in
my efforts; not one of them therefore possesses a right of intervention
in the Congo, which nothing could justify
My rights in the Congo are absolute; they are the results of my
labor and expense."</p>

<p>With this clear announcement of the international rights of
the Congo Free State should be compared the opinion of the Belgian
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Baron de Favereau:</p>

<p>"It would be contrary to all principles of international law that
a Government should interfere in the internal administration of
a sovereign State."</p>

<p>Also with Mr. Root's equally explicit opinion:</p>

<p>"The Congo State absolutely denies any right on their (i. e.,
the Powers) part to intervene in its affairs, and none of the other
signatory Powers appear to controvert that denial. However
this may be, it is certain that the United States has no treaty right
of intervention. We could not rightfully summon or participate
in any international conference looking to intervention, adjudication
or enforcement of a general accord by other African Powers
against the Congo State."</p>
