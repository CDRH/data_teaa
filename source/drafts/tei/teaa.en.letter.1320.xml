to their respective signatures, certifying
explicitly, that the said

<p>No. 30/1901 Miscellaneous.
Consulate General of the
United States.
Monrovia, Liberia,
September 2, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. James Boyle,
United States Consul,
Liverpool.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt August
30, 1901, of your note of August 9,
1901, relative to securing for
you as evidence as  per British
law, in your prosecutiion of
the claim of Mrs. Amelia A.
Chase of Provincetown Massachusetts
for £127, in the hands of
Mess'rs Nicholas Waterhouse
and Sons of Liverpool, against
the estate of the late James H.
Logan, deceased of Grand Bassa
County, Liberia; a certified copy
of the last Will and Testament
of</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4126.jpg"/>

<p>of the said James H. Logan.</p>

<p>In reply to your Note, I have to say
that I called upon the President of
Liberia, the following day, August 31, 1901,
relative to said matter. After stating
to him the circumstances of the case
coupled with the fact that I advised
M. C. Atwood Esq., of Providencetown
Massachusetts, the administrator of
the estate of the late Captain Chase
to refer the matter to you for collection
from Messrs. Waterhouse and
Sons; telling the President that
according to British practice it was
necessary that I secure a certified
copy of the Will, in order that the
same may be recorded in England,
before you can proceed to force
a collection, he assured me that he
would advise that the matter of
securing a certified copy of the Will
be attended to through the State
Department, Monrovia, and the
Superintendent of Grand Bassa
County Liberia.</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4127.jpg"/>

<p>I have this day according to his
request, filed my formal written
application for same with the
State Department, Monrovia;
and have the assurance of the
Secretary of State, that the matter
shall have his earliest possible
attention. Therefore, hoping to be
able to forward the desired certified
copy of the Will to you at an early date.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be yours,
&amp;c.,
Owen L. W. Smith,
Consul General.</p>

<p>Department of State,
Monrovia, Liberia,
Sept. 3, 1901.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to acknwoledge
the receipt of your dispatch
of the 2nd instant, touching the
matter of the last Will and
Testament of James H. Logan,
deceased.</p>

<p>In reply I have to
inform you that the matter will
be attended to as early as possible.
As these are some fees to be paid
the Clerk of the Monthly and Probate
Count for copying the Will
and certificate, I would like to
inquire, to whom must be
forwarded his bill for payment?</p>

<p>I would like to inform
him so as to save time.</p>

<p>So far as the Judge and
Superintendent's signature and seals
are concerned, that is unnecessary.
A</p>

<p>A certificate under seal from
this Department, certifying
that the person who signed
his names as Clerk of the
Monthly and Probate Court is
the duly appointed and
commissioned Clerk, is all that
is necessary.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,
Sir,
your obedient servant,

Acting Secretary of State,

U.S. Minister Resident

you that the matter is under
consideration and a reply to same

Consulate general of the

<p>Hon. James Boyle,
United States Consul,
Liverpool.</p>

<p>Sir:
Referring to my No. 30/1901, Miscellaneous,
of September 2, 1901, I now, in
compliance with your request
contained in your note of August
9, 1901, asking me to secure for
you if possible a certified
copy of the last Will and
Testament of the Late James
H. Logan, deceased of Grand
Bassa County, Liberia, I now
have the honor to transmit
herewith, a certified certificate
from the Clerk of the Monthly and
Probate Court for Grand Bassa County
certifying that Mr. Logan left no Will.
Hence Mrs. M. L. Logan was
appointed</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4132.jpg"/>

<p>appointed Administratrix and
Jacob Logan administrator of the estate
of the deceased James H. Logan.
And as I have previously secured
their endorsement and approval
of the draft of the late James H.
Logan in favor of Captain
Josiah A. Chase for £127, upon
Messrs. Waterhouse and Sons,
of Liverpool, I do not now see
but what you have really a
strong case against them.</p>

<p>I yesterday received a letter
from M. C. Atwood Esq., relative
to costs &amp;c, in this and former
services rendered by me, in this
case. I will write him direct.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be
yours &amp;c,
Owen L. W. Smith,
Consul General</p>
