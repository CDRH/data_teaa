<p>Sir,
Herewith I have the honor to
transmit the return of the arrival and 
Departures of American Vessels and
the statement of Fees for the half year
ending the 31st December 1866.</p>
    
<p>The Fees, never a large item here,
have considerably fallen off since the 
Rebellion of the Southern States in
consequence of the bulk of the American 
Trade having since that period been
carried on under the English Flag.
For the last half year the total
is only $20.23 a sum insufficient 
even to pay a Man to attend to the 
Flag+ Flag Staffsade.</p>

herewith enclosed you will see that the</p>

own House which is rated at French Cuid
of fifty dollars after <unclear/> and would
readily let a Fifteen Hundred dollars
I respectfully crave to be allowed Five
Hundred and Fifty Dollarsa after <unclear/>

at the Flag staff as also a small bon
flag.

I have the honor to be
