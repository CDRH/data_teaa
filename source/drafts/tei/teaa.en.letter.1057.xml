<note>Department of State Received Oct 28 1887</note>

<p>Franklinton<lb/>
Franklin Co. N.C.<lb/>
Oct 26/87.</p>

<p>Hon. A. A. Adee<lb/>
Second Asst<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Your favor of the
22nd inst came duly to
hand and was glad
to hear from you.
Please permit me to
intrude upon your
time by asking you
for questions in

<pb n="Roll5-1214.jpg"/>

regard to my
account with the State
Department as U.S.
Vice Consul Genl when
I was in Liberia.
In the month of July I
was at the Department
of State and I was
told that many of the
items which include
my report were
disallowed. Such
items as for messenger
at the Legation and
many others. Please
allow me to state
that I cannot get

<pb n="Roll5-1215.jpg"/>

vouchers for such
items because I am
now living in this
country and no hopes
as far as I know of
going back. I have
written to the Secretary
of State all about the
matter of which I
hear speaks.</p>

<p>My fourth quarter 1886
in which I paid
messenger $15. was
disallowed. My first
quarter 1887 in which
I paid my messenger
was also disallowed.
Sir permit me to say

<pb n="Roll5-1216.jpg"/>

I paid the messenger
every quarter during
my service as U.S.
Vice Consul $15.00; but
could not get a
voucher; because the
boy was a native boy
who could not write;
and further I did
not <unclear extent="one word"/> fully that
I had to send voucher
for every little sum.
I hope the Department
will consider these
items for messenger
charged against me
which I have paid.
Further more I hope
the Department of State

<pb n="Roll5-1217.jpg"/>

consider that I took
the Legation in charge
render <del>many</del> many disadvantage
not being acquainted
with the work and its rules.</p>

<p>I am willing that the
Department of State
disallow the funeral expenses
of Moses. A. Hopkins; but
for the rest which I 
think is due me
should be paid. I
paid $44.89 to Mrs. E
J Harmon of Cape
Palmas as I was
told to do. Please
look at one of your

<pb n="Roll5-1218.jpg"/>

Consular Series and
you will find where
I was told so to do by
the Asst Secretary of State,
and that has been
charged against me.
There are many 
items charged against
me which I have
paid in order to keep
up the credit of the U.S.
Legation.</p>

<p>The reason G. Moore
has many of my
drafts is because when
I had small returns to
pay and had not
the money to do it

<pb n="Roll5-1219.jpg"/>

with their firm always
would advance me
the money until I
would afford to draw
a large draft. I could
not draw a draft for
every little item; so
I got them to pay off
what I owed <del>and</del>
and at the end of
each quarter I paid
them in draft that
is the reason you see
such a large draft
or amount disallowed.
I have written to Secretary
of State about
these things or facts as named

<pb n="Roll5-1220.jpg"/>

but I have not heard
from him. I want
matters all fix up;
therefore I again write.
Please try and explain
matters to the Department
of State for me. I do
not wish to cheat the
Government out one
cent more than what
is due me. I inclose
a letter from C. H. J. Taylor
U.S. Minister at
Monrovia which I
cannot understand
toward the last where
he speaks of my
character through life
would be darkened.

<pb n="Roll5-1221.jpg"/>

Am I indebted to the
U.S. Government or is
the Government indebted
to me? Why should
he speak in that way?
I <sic>dont</sic> understand him.
I did my best in
serving the U.S.
Government and if I am
short I am willing to
forego what little the
government is indebted
to me. I know the
Department of State will
do what is best. Out
side of the funeral
expenses of the late
Minister Moses A

<pb n="Roll5-1222.jpg"/>

Hopkins I hope the
Department will disallow
nothing. Indeed
I had trouble in Africa
in doing what I did
do for the government,
after Hopkins death.
Please Sir, just
think of my situation
at that time when not
being acquainted
with such a position.
Hoping to hear from
you soon</p>

<p>I remain<lb/>
Dear Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Samuel S. Sevier</p>

<p>Franklinton<lb/>
N.C.</p>

<p>I have to inform you in obedience to
instruction No 4, Consular series, received from Washington
dated June 7th 1887, in answer to your No 68 of
April 19th, that the Department refuses to interfere
in any agreement between you and Mr Hopkins,
during his life time for services rendered by you
to him. Using the language of the Department I have
to say "Mr Hopkins was paid in full for the term of
his service and Mr Sevier must look to the estate
of Mr Hopkins for payment of his claim if he means
to press it."</p>

<p>Letters received here, on the 13th instant, informs
you, that your draft of April 26th 1887, for <unclear>$1700.00</unclear>

to pay non residents. This information is received
from the office of the comptroller of the currency
Washington D.C. and carries date June 23rd 1887.
I am also instructed to inform you by the
Department of states No. 5 consular series, of date
July 11th rec'd in Monrovia on the 13th inst that on the
3rd quarter of 1886 your account is approved for $94.57
instead of for $127.07 as claimed by you the following
items being disallowed. Cleaning Legation $10.00
Attending Minister Hopkins $1.50 Hiring boat &amp; crew to take
Mrs Hopkins to steamer $6.00 suspended for want of voucher
