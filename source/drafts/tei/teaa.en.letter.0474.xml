<ab>Commercial Agency
Kongo Free State 
Boma-Kampa. Lomani River
April 17th, 1893

To the Honorable
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington, D.C.</ab>

<p>Sir"
I have the honor to report any ar-
rival att Boma-Kamba April 10th + that
on the 14th forming the expedition against
the Arab Slave dealers. As I resired greatly
to see the part of the Kongo Free State
reoccupied key the arabs it being con-
sidered the richest and most purposelly
and as it was impossible to visit this
section unless with a strong expe-
dition commandant Chalting invited me to 
go with with as a quest and as stated
in any letter of March 17th (no member)
I accepted upon arrival at Bena-Kamba
behold one three of his officers Under the
peculiar circumstances I accepted the 
proposition and am commanding hid 
two Krupp Field csnon and one 
armed soldiers of course it is 
quite understood that phase or
accept any remmaration from the
Kongo Free State.</p>
    
<p>This Lomani River was opened last 
year in the month of march by the 
Dyndicat du Katanga" of Brussels with
Mr.R.Hodester at its head. They 

established</p>
    
<pb facs="20170614_143918"
<p>established. Trading Stahons, or Facloyo at
the following profits Yanga. Bena-Kamba
+ Lomo in the Lomama and at Kibongo
Riba: Ruba and Nygangous in the High 
Kongo, or Loulaba River after these places
were founded and stocked with goods to 
the value of over $250,00.00 the Arabs
attacked them, killing the agents of Loma
+Riba. Riba + Mr.Hodister with four
white companing on the was from
Bema Kemba to Riba Ribe the 
other agents at the different factories
heard this and made their escape to 
Stanley falls. The State agent at Riba
Riba was tortured to death. All the 
factories were burned and the cloths,
beads, money, etc taken.</p> 
    
<p>This January they have killed the two 
State Agents ar Kassonho so the govern-
ment organized me expedition from
Lusamno in the Lankuru River to pro-
ceed a gainst Nyangone+Kassongo+
one to go from Basoko to the Lomami
+destroy Chari. Beng Kamba + Riba-
Riba +Kibonge. The situation now
stands:--</p>
 
<p>Liutenant Dhanis form Lusambo, occupies
Nyangone + is marching to Kassongo with
four hundred poldew and on any hundreds
of natives who have voluntarily joined
his Captain Chaltier has destroyed
Chari a town of 1000 houses and a 
population estimated at 15000 persons
and on the 20th instant starts for
Riba-Riba with four hundred soldiers
+expects to be re-enforced by the natives
on the road.</p>
    
<p>In the River Lomani me have been in many 
villages destroyed nu the Arabs in their slave

raids</p>
<pb facs="20170614_143931"
<p>was, and in two places the headless bodies
men, women, and children were found .
These people are simply devasting centrak
Africa, buit I think the energetie measures
the Government are now taking will put a 
slop to this refarious half life at least
for a long time, in the secretary of the 
state.</p>  

<p>At the present I can only give the present
survey to this slave business, but in 
my final report will dwell upon it to
a greater extent:

I am Sir,
Very respectfully
R.Dorsey Mohew
Commercial Agent</p>
