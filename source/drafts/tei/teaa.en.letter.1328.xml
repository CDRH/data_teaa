<p>Miss Winifred Miller,
P.O. Box 121,

<p>Sir:
In reply to your letter of the 14
instant, I have to inform you
that your enquiries may be
addressed to Ezekiel E. Smith,
Minister Resident and Consul General
of the United States, Monrovia, Liberia.</p>

<p>I am, Madam, Your obedient Servant,

<p>Hayier, Cape Palmas, July 30th 1890</p>

<p>Mrs. E. A. Miller</p>

<p>Dear Madame !
We are in possession of yours
date on the 4th of June.</p>

<p>Your husband always told me, he wish to see
his home once more, he tried hard to
sell his premises, but he could not find a
buyer for it. so he had to stay here.</p>

<p>We are very glad to hear that you have
confidence in us, be sure, we will do our
best, we can.</p>

<p>We intend to sell the Estate of your husband,
in May already, but a Gentleman with name
Alfred H. Dent had a claim against the
farmland, with <unclear>coffee lures</unclear>.</p>

<p>Your husband leased the farmland, 2 1/2 Acres
in the year 1882 from Mrs Catherine Beam and
Mrs. Mariah Dent. Mr. Alfred H. Dent, a son
of Mariah Dent had the original lease of
the 2 1/2 Acres of farmlands, on which your
husband wrote, that the farmland should</p>

<pb n="Roll7-1006.jpg"/>

<p>transfered to Catherine Beams after his death,
but this lady died 4 years ago, our opinion
is, the farmland belonging still to the Estate
of your husband, but the Alfred H Dent,
asserted now, the farmland with <unclear>Coffee lures</unclear>
belongig to him, because he is a brother of
Catherine R. Beams. The quarterly count willl
decided in next month, who the farmland
belonging too.</p>

<p>Enclosed we beg to hand you, the copies
of the lease and also a copy of your
husband's last will.</p>

<p>Further please receive enclosed a certificate
of your husband's death.</p>

<p>Your husband did not thought he was going
to die, as we wrote you last, he only
caught a bad cold and fever came to <unclear></unclear>
that gave him the death.</p>

<p>He did not left any word for you or your
Children, because he did not thought he
would leave this world forever.</p>

<p>We wrote you last, already, the Masons
buried our firend, on the graveyard at
this place, there was several hundred, people
at the funeral of our friend, and also
the military, at was a sorrowful day for</p>

<pb n="Roll7-1007.jpg"/>

<p>every one in this place, became nearly very one
like your husband and our friend look in
Cape Palmas on Account of all the goodness
he has done here (and
Your husband told his housekeeper, Mrs Tubman, 
whenever he should died here in Cape Palmas,
she should have a double coffine made for
him and we did so.
Hope you will receive the enclosed papers
carred, re remain,
Respectfully Yours</p>
