Sir,

The United States Flag of this Office being completely destroyed by the rainy weather I request the Department of State will be pleased to furnish me with a couple of new ones.

The custom at this place is to hoist the National Flags daily and the inclemency of the rainy season destroys them rapidy.

I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient Servant
W.B. Davies Esqre
