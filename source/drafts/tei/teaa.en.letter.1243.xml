<p>No. 2, Consular Series
Legation of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia;
Aug., 29, 1898.</p>

<p>Hon. Thos W. Cridler,
Third Asst. Secretary,
Wasington.</p>

<p>Sir:-
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of
your dispatch No 5. July
15, 1898, with Inclosure of
a letter and petition of
Pet. A. W. Reuner Esq. of Cape
Coast Caslte, with thanks,
for consideration &amp; c.
Your dispatch reached
me, Aug, 27, 1898. In reply
to which I mos repsectfully
refer you to my
dispatch No 21 Aug. 11
1898, to Department of State.</p>

<p>In reply to your
instruction, that I report</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2163.jpg"/>

<p>Upon, the necessity of a further
continuation of the Agency at
Cape Coast Castle, would
say, first, that the Gold Coast
Colony, Africa, of which Area
is the Capital, is a British
possession; and according to
Walker's Almanac of
British possessions, in Africa,
Cape Coast Castle has a
population of 11,614 while
Elmina, the house of the late
George E. Eminsang, has a
population of 10,530, hence
from the population of the
two cities, most of necessity,
command a considerable
commercial <unclear></unclear>
As to the matter of trade from
the Gold Coast to the United States, it seems to have been
greatly neglected. ANd until
it shall have been properly
worked up, I would probably
be <unclear></unclear> in recommending
recommending</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2164.jpg"/>

<p>Recommending a discontinuation
of the Agency. I would, therefore,
the rather, recommend, that
said agency, be continued
until apportunity enables me
to learn more of the place, or
proper attention and arrangments
by American merchants
shall have been more fully
made, in order to increase
exports to, and exports from
the United States.</p>

<p>As to the application of Pet. A. W.
Reuner Esq. for the Consular
Agency at Cape Coast
Castle, I learned by inquiry
that he is a Sierra Leonean, a man of much ability
but for some cause was
for some time disbarred
from practice, but has
subsequently been restored.
Secondly, As it is now
currently circulated, here, that
peace has been declared,
between</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2165.jpg"/>

<p>between the United States and
Spain, it will doubtless
give an opportunity for
American vessels, to again
with the Coasts of Africa, the
better enabling us to decide
upon the necessity of the agency.
Thirdly: I will say <unclear></unclear>
as well as confidentially, that
judging from 
as informed interview,
believes the Secretary of
State -- Monrovia, and
myself on the 26, instant
I am led to believe that
it will soon be my privilege,
as well as duty, to 
communicate to the 
department of State, Washington
the expressed desire of the
Liberian Government, to have
the Government of the United States, to extend a protectorate
over the Liberian Republic!
And</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2166.jpg"/>

<p>And, in the event that the
AMerican Government
accedes to such a requestl
as American gov do and
manufactures, have even
now, quite a demand, in 
Liberian markets; and on
both the Liberian merchant
and farmer, are very
anxious to open up a market
in America, for the exchange
of their products; as
an evidence of which I have
already succeded
in securing natural
consignments of Liberian
production, to New York,
Baltimore, and Boston.
notwithstanding, these products
had to be shipped,
by way of Liverpool owing to existing
hostilities between the United States
and Spain. 
Upon the cessation
of</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2167.jpg"/>

<p>of these hostilities; and the return of peace; where shipping, by American cessels, can again,
be resumed, without fear of
being seized by enemies'
ships; it is more than probable
that such a protictorate
would be the means of a
more etended commerical 
<unclear></unclear> between
the United States and Liberia:
thus necessitating not only,
the retention of the Agency
at Cape Coast Castle,
but possible, the establishment of
one at Accra, the Capitol
of the Gold Coast Colony,
with a population of 16, 276,
as well as at Sinae, Harper, Cape Palmas, and the restoration
of the Agency at Grand Bassa, Liberia.
Awaiting further developments of affairs, between the two Governments,
I</p>

<pb n="Roll6-2168.jpg"/>

<p>I do not, at this writing
feel myslef, justified to 
recommend a discontinuation
of the Cape Coast Castle Agency.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be your obedient servant;
Owen L. W. Smith</p>

<p>P.S. My dispatch No 21
Aug 11 1898 to Department of State
