Paris, April 13th      1867

<p>
Mister Admiral and dear colleague,
following the reports addressed to the Government <!-- 'Gouvernement' is hyphenated between 'Gou-' and '-vernement' -->
of Washington by Mr. Nassou,
american missionary in Coriseo and by
Mr. Perrot, commercial agent in Gabon,
Mr Minister of the United States in Paris
was charged with bringing to my knowledge
different facts that would be produced
in this area. I have the honor of
sending to you enclosed, a translation of the
dispatch that Mr. General Ten 
addressed to me on this subject. There is question
in the first place, as Your Excellence
will see, of slave trade that
will be carried out on the dependent territories <!-- 'dépendant' is hyphenated between 'dépen' and '-dant' -->
</p>

His Excellence

of our establishment of Gabon.
The representative of Cabinet of Washington <!-- 'Washington' is hyphenated between 'Was-' and '-hington' -->
signals, furthermore, the acts
of pillage that the american citizens
would have had to suffer, just as a
recent attempt of murder, and it insists <!-- 'insiste' is hyphenated between 'in-' and 'siste' -->
on this fact, that the complaints that
these crimes motivated would not have
been welcomed, as they merited,
by our local authorities.
</p>

<p>
There is place to suppose that the
slave trade that are denounced to us <!-- 'dénoncées' is hyphenated between 'dé-' and '-noncées' -->
are precisely those that
Your Excellence discussed with me
by its letter from the 19th of last month and
on the subject of which I had to address
the observations to the Portugese Government. <!-- 'Portugais' is hyphenated between 'Port-' and '-gais' -->
It would thus be easy for me in ths
</p>

<p>
regard to remove the responsibility of our
authorities of Gabon, since it is 
despite their efforts, that the trading of
slaves still subsists in this area
and that, far from being indifferent, they
are not ceasing, contrarily, to concern themselves <!-- 'préoccuper' is hyphenated between 'préoccu-' and '-per' -->
with the necessary measures to put
an end to it.
</p>

<p>
As for the other griefs articulated
by Mr. Minister of the United States, they
are remarkable for their gravity itself, <!-- 'même' is hyphenated between 'mê-' and '-me' -->
to our most serious axamination, and
I will be obliged to Your Excellence to <!-- 'vouloir' is hyphenated between 'vou-' and '-loir' -->
make me part of the result
of the investigation that she will assess, without doubt,
concerning to prescribe in this regard, in order
to put me in measure of responding
to the communication of Mr. Genreal
Ten./.
Accept,
