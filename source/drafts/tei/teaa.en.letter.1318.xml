the United States,

October 5, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State
Washington.</p>

<p>Subject.
The prospects of an early
settlement of the claim
of Miss Winifred Miller,
against the Liberian
Government, very doubtful</p>

<p><add>Consular Bureau.

<p>No. 79. Consular.
Consulate General
of the United States,
Monrovia, Liberia,
October 5, 1901.</p>

<p>Hon. David J. Hill,
Assistant Secretary of State,
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir:
I have the honor to
say that referring to my 
No. 73, Consular, of June
4, 1901, I informed the
Department that the
claim of Miss Winifred
Miller, heir of the late
<unclear></unclear> M. Miller, against
the Liberian Government
for a balance of Four Hundred
Fifty six 59/100 Dollars
represented by the Hon.
C. E. Littlefield; an
order for which had
been drawn by F. O. Thorne,</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4090.jpg"/>

<p>4</p>

<p>in my favor, upon Hon.
A. Barclay, Secretary of
the Treasury, which order,
had been accepted by him,
and that in an interview
with the President (who is
de facto Secretary of State)
upon the subject of settlement,
he informed me
that the order would be
paid early in the beginning
of the July quarter
1901. After the departure
of the Secretary of the Treasury,
for England, without
having made payment,
thereof. I dispatched my
No 24, Miscellaneous, of
July 11, 1901, to the Acting
Secretary of State
relative to the matter of
payment Enclosed see
the reply of the Acting
Secretary of the Treasury July
25, 1901, to the Secretary of State;
and</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4091.jpg"/>

<p>5</p>

<p>and of the Secretary of State
July 29, 1901, to me touching
this matter.</p>

<p>The Honorable Arthur Barclay,
returned September 17, 1901,
before the end of the Liberian
fiscal year, September 30th
the time that the Acting
Secretary of the Treasury
<unclear></unclear> that arrangements
and a settlement would
be made. According I
called at the State Department
September 18, 1901, in
person, and called up
my No. 24, Miscellaneous,
of July 11, 1901, and requested
the Secretary of State to
see the Secretary of the Treasury
and arrange for a
settlement of said claim
by the close of the quarter
September 30, 1901. In
reply he assured me an
early reply, the which I 
have</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4092.jpg"/>

<p>6</p>

<p>have not yet received.</p>

<p>Having had several
interviews with the President,
relative to the settlement
of this claim, who had
stated two difinite times,
when said amount
should be paid, I
incidentally met him at
the Executive Mansion,
Tuesday September 24,
1901, and called his attention
to the fact that I
had not heard from my
request of September 18, 1901,
through the State Department,
and asked that he would
be so kind, as to have the
matter attended to before
the close of the quarter. He
again assured me that
he would have an interview
with the Secretary of the
Treasury during the day; a cabinet
meeting, Thursday September
26,</p>

<pb n="Roll6-4093.jpg"/>

<p>7</p>

<p>26, 1901, and would have
the matter attended to by
Friday, September 27, 1901.
Hearing no more from
him, touching this matter,
on Saturday morning,
September 28, 1901. I
dispatched to him, direct
my No. 39, Miscellaneous
relative to the matter and
has there far failed to
receive a reply, from either
the President or the Secretary
of State, touching this matter.
I am impressed to
believe that they have no
intention of a settlement of
said claim, short of some
<unclear>peremtory</unclear>; strong and direct
demand from the Department
of State, Washington.
I have the awaiting your
advice and further instructions, I have the honor
to be your obedient
servant;</p>
