<p>MASSACHUSETTS CATHOLIC ORDER OF FORESTERS.</p>
    
<p>Boston, Mass., Jan. 16, 1907.</p>

<p>His Majesty, King Leopold,
Belgium
His Majesty:-</p>

<p>The High Standing Committee of the Massachussetts
Catholic Order of Foresters, representing 100,000 souls, in meeting
assembled January 14th, 1907, endorsed the following resolution:-</p>

<p>WHEREAS it has come to our knowledge that accusations
have been made against King Leopold's administration of the
Congo Free State.</p>
    
<p>WHEREAS we believe that these accusations are unfounded
and are inspired by religious jealousy and by the desire
of a certain strong nation to extend its power in Africa.</p>
    
<p>Be it resolved, and it is hereby resolved:</p>
    
<p>That we deprecate the use of means such as have marked
the action of our protestant bretheren in this matter; the defaming
of an individual is a serious breach of Christ's Commands;
the defaming of a whole nation and of a Christian King is most
serious. </p>
    
<p>Resolved, second, that relying on the testimony
of trustworthy Catholic Bishops and missionaries in the Congo, of
travellers who have visited the country and who know the actual
conditions prevailing there, and of the impartial commissioners
who recently reported on the subject, we see no greater reason</p>
    
<pb></pb>
    
<p>for an international investigation of King Leopold's rule in the
Congo than for an international investigation of the administration
of any other Power in Africa.</p>
    
<p> Resolved, third, that no body of men will go farther
to redress the human misery than members of this organization.</p>
    
<p>Resolved, fourth, that we extend to the caluminated
King our sympathy with him in this matter in which he has been so 
unjustly occused.</p>
    
<p>Resolved, fifth, that copies of these resolutions
be sent to the President of the United States, the Secretary of
State, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the two Senators
from Massachussetts, and to His Majesty, King Leopold.</p>
    
<p>Attest--
(signed) JOHN J. LEONARD
High Secretary-Treasurer.</p>
