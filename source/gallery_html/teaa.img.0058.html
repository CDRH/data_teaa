  <p>Anna Boardman Smith identifies the Temne and the Limbas as two of the "tribes of people" living in the British Protectorate of Sierra Leone. Purportedly, the Temne possessed a "more warlike disposition than many" other ethnic groups in the colony. Smith describes the Temne using anti-black racist language in an effort to de-Africanize them and distance them from "Negroes." "These people do not manifest the striking negro characteristics of the Africans who live farther to the South. The exceedingly flat noses, thick lips, and receding foreheads are rarely met with. They bear a greater resemblance to the Arab type, and a foreigner is often surprised at the finely shaped heads and beautiful features he finds among this dusky race" (101). This trope of the "Arab Negro" was ubiquitous in travel narratives where White (and sometimes Black) travelers posited a phenotypical homogeneity amongst Africans. They explained any deviation from this stereotype by alleging that those Africans were most likely mixed with "Arab blood." Smith describes King Suluku of the Limba as a man comparable to the biblical King Solomon. A reputed polygamist with over a thousand wives, Suluku ruled over "Limba land" through which many of the missionaries traveled (131). Smith claimed that Kalawa was "expected to become King of the Limba country," which pleased the missionaries as he supposedly loved them (96). Moreover, Kalawa pledged to give over ten boys from his family to attend the mission school.</p>
