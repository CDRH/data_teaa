<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>In May 1915, W. E. B. Du Bois and others took steps to incorporate the Horizon Guild in order to raise funds for the production of a new, expanded version of <em>The Star of Ethiopia</em>, which would take place at the American League Baseball Park in Washington, D.C., in mid-October of that year.  According to a letter in Du Bois's Papers, the purpose of the Horizon Guild corporation was "to encourage the development of art among persons of Negro descent by the production of pageants and plays, the publication of books and pictures, and the establishment of an art center" where artists could live and their productions could be displayed.</p>
