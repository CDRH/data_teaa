<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>In this map, Mohun notes the location of "very large plantations" that cultivate corn, rice, and manioc in Romie, a town near the Stanley Falls (now Boyoma Falls). The map also includes the location of the <em>Ville de Bruxelles</em>, showing its proximity to the plantations on the west side of the Congo River. Mohun includes sketches of buildings, such as an "old Arab" structure then occupied by the "State Forces." This bird's eye view provided U.S. officials with a sense of the spatial arrangement of agriculture and trade in the Upper Congo Basin. As U.S. Commercial Agent for the Congo Free State, Mohun wanted the United States to understand the relationship between the agricultural and commercial enterprises in the region.</p>
