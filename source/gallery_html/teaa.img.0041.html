  <p>In 1918, Claude A. Barnett (known for having founded the Associated Negro Press two years earlier) established The Kashmir Chemical Company, a black-owned beauty products company targeting African American women as its consumers. The company later re-launched as Nile Queen, using iconography in their advertisements and packaging inspired by the then-current "Egyptomania." These advertisements were placed in <em>The Crisis</em> magazine, the organ of the NAACP edited by W. E. B. Du Bois, among other periodicals. Cleopatra and Sheba, queens of ancient Egypt and Ethiopia respectively—representing both ends of the Nile—appear in the advertisements as fantastic regal aspirations for the modern African American woman. In addition, all of these advertisements depict a glamorous, aspirational consumer in her boudoir flanked by a servant.</p>

<p>In the December 1919 advertisement, the juxtaposition of a reclining, barely dressed woman with a nude, turbaned servant kneeling visually reverses Manet's 1863 painting, <em>Olympia</em>.</p>
