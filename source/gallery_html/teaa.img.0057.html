<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This photograph appears in "Chapter VI: The Temne People and their Customs" in Anna Boardman Smith's missionary narrative. Smith explains that while the Temne are farmers, they do not live on their farms "the year round." Rather, they "huddle together in towns" about four to five miles away from each other. Within these towns, "each man" builds wherever he chooses, but the dwellings are remarkably similar. She provides a detailed description of the building process (105-108). The end result are the grass-shingled structures seen in the photograph.</p>
