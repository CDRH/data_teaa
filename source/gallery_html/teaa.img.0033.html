  <p>Within the pages of <em>The Crisis</em> magazine, stories and images of Africans from various parts of the continent were featured and highlighted. African rulers, in particular, were of interest. Here Menelik II, the late emperor of Ethiopia is featured. Born in 1844, Menelik was the Emperor of Abyssinia from 1866-1889. When, in 1893, his kingdom was attacked by Italians, he defeated the European nation in the well-known Battle of Adwa. Abyssinia loomed large in African American imagination for its challenges to oppression. Ethiopia's tradition of independence was symbolic for Black freedom and Black pride.</p>

<p>The term "Ethiopia" was often used as a generic reference for Africa in the King James translation of the Bible. Psalm 68 alludes to God punishing the wicked while the righteous rejoice: "Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto God." Africans in diaspora used the psalm to speak of Black liberation in Africa and African diaspora, interpreting it to mean God's promise to deliver the entire African race from oppression and to redeem Africa. Thus when Menelik led the resistance to the Italians, African Americans were affronted at this attempt to colonize Ethiopia. Italian defeat at Adwa represented Ethiopia's independence in a continent that was largely colonized by Europeans. Menelik was, therefore, a symbol of this autonomy.</p>

<p>This connection to Ethiopia would continue into the twentieth century, as African Americans watched the progress of Abyssinia. In 1935, when the Italians once again invaded Ethiopia, we see a similar response.  Italy, citing opposition to treaties in the wake of Adwa, sought to subjugate Abyssinia. This attack saw worldwide response of African descended people in Africa and the African diaspora. Italy's assault galvanized men and women of African descent all over the world as they recognized how inextricably their plight was tied up with Africa. For blacks around the world, Ethiopia was a symbol of black achievement, resistance, freedom, and power, and provided hope of Black liberation.</p>
