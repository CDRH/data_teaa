  <p>This image was featured in the <em>Journal of the Twenty-Third Annual Session of the National Baptist Convention</em> held with the Holy Trinity Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 16-21, 1903. The National Baptist Convention (NBC) organized in 1895 as a vehicle for African American Baptists to assemble yearly to address issues confronting the church and the race. Because of the racism embedded in many white Baptist congregations, the Black Baptists decided to maintain their autonomy by not conferring with them. The NBC agenda included "foreign missions, funding for education, and the establishment of newspapers and journals."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> The map shows NBC African missions located in Lagos (Nigeria), South Africa, and the British Central Africa Protectorate. The image highlights six male missionaries and one female missionary: Rev. J. Buchanan, Middle Drift, South Africa; Miss E. B. DeLaney; Rev. L. N. Cheek; Chiradzulu Blantyre, B.C. Africa; Rev. Majola Agbebi, Lagos, West Africa; Rev. H. N. Bouy, D. D.; Rev. E. B. Koti, Queens Town, South Africa; Rev. John Chilembwe; and Chiradzulu Blantyre, B. C. Africa. Many of the missionaries' names indicate that there was some attempt by the NBC to "indigenize" or "Africanize" the missions by training African missionaries. Nevertheless, the image leans into the trope of "Darkest Africa," portraying Africans as benighted peoples in need of Christian redemption.</p>
