  <p>Founded in Atlanta by John E. Bowen and Jesse Max Barber, <em>The Voice of the Negro</em> was a literary and news journal that ran from 1904 to 1907. The magazine relocated to Chicago after the Atlanta Race Riot of 1906. Within the pages of this publication, African Americans could find news articles about issues and concerns affecting their communities, read about the state of affairs in the United States, and learn about events and happenings in Africa. Of particular interest were the many articles engaging with the relationship between African Americans and Africa, interrogating what Africa meant for the "American Negro." As African Americans sought to establish their place and right to be in America, prominent African Americans engaged this question in <em>The Voice of the Negro</em>. A magazine which centered on African Americans and their achievements, it profiled men and women "of the race." This publication seriously took up the issue of the "Negro Question" and the "African Question," exploring connections between African Americans and Africa. Articles such as "Who Are Weâ€”Africans, Afro-Americans, Colored People Negroes, or American Negroes?," "The Negro Question in Africa and America," sought to explore what Black Americans called themselves and how they understood their connection to Africa.</p>
