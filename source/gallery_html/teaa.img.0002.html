<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This photo is part of the pictorial tribute to "the black soldier" in the Great War. This image depicts a Spahi, one of many light cavalrymen in the French army, from the French colonies in North Africa: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. The caption describes these Algerian Spahis as "Negroid" to distinguish them from the Spahis of Arab and Berber descent. The Spahis constituted an important part of the <em>Armeé d'Afrique</em>, which formed during the French invasion and conquest of Algeria (1830-1587). During World War I, the French colonial army's Black troops included the <em>Tirailleurs Sénégalais</em> (Senegalese troops), Spahis, and African men from sub-Saharan French colonies.</p>
