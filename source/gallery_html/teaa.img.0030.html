<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Wearing an <em>a-la-mode</em> dress, hat, and parasol, "Miss Ethiopia" speculates about how the United States government will treat African Americans. The caption reads, "I wonder what they are saying about me"—likely a reference to "What Are the Wild Waves Saying?" (1850), a song by Stephen Glover based upon a scene in Charles Dickens's novel <em>Dombey and Son</em>.</p>
