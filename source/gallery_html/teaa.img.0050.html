<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This image comes from <em>The Missionary Magazine</em>, which followed the convention of including photographs of mission fields in articles about missionaries serving abroad. Seated on chairs are G. T. Kerr and D. U. Hale, the two white male missionaries. Mrs. Kerr stands behind Mr. Kerr with her hand resting on his shoulder. She is the ideal Christian helpmeet. The photo's caption is misleading, as the picture includes four other unidentified people–two African men standing behind the white men and two African boys sitting on the floor on either side of the white men. One wears traditional African clothing while the other dons Western, perhaps American, garb. The placement of these boys frame the missionary photograph that was typical for its period. We see the Africans only through white-supremacist and Christian-centric lenses. Thus, this photograph, like others taken during this period "between the 1890s and the first world war, photographs of Africa were published profusely to promote a variety of imperial, commercial, missionary, and scientific enterprises."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Here, the work of the Kerrs and Hale appears to be the "civilizing" of the African men and working to effectuate the same for the African boys.</p>
