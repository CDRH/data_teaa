<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This map shows the location of the National Baptist Convention's foreign missions in Africa in 1903-1904. The National Baptist Convention (NBC) organized in 1895 as a vehicle for African American Baptists to assemble yearly to address issues confronting the church and the race. Because of the racism embedded in many white Baptist congregations, the Black Baptists decided to maintain their autonomy by not conferring with them. The NBC agenda included "foreign missions, funding for education, and the establishment of newspapers and journals."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> NBC African missions were located in Lagos, South Africa, and the British Central Africa Protectorate. Lagos Colony, as it was known at the time, was a British protectorate from 1862 to 1906. Cape Colony in South Africa was part of the British Empire from 1806 to 1910. The British Central Africa Protectorate (located in present-day Malawi) bordered Lake Nyasa and was proclaimed by the British in 1889. It remained such until 1907 when its name changed to Nyasaland. This map reveals that NBC African missions worked within the confines of the British Empire where they were more likely to use their English language skills to proselytize to British colonial subjects.</p>
