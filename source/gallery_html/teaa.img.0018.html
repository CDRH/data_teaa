<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Mohun's map of Stanley Falls (present-day Boyoma Falls) accompanied his June 21, 1893, despatch written to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State. The sketch notes several features that Mohun believed were essential to the maintenance of Arab power in the area, which could be targeted in any attack on the stronghold. Here, Mohun provides a "zoomed-out" or widest possible view of the area that corresponds to his accompanying sketches of individual structures. Notably, Mohun's legend includes the location of the State Post, the Société Anonyme Belge, and the vessel S.S. <em>Ville de Bruxelles</em>. Founded in 1888, the Société controlled several trading posts along the Congo River as a private company. By 1905, it was one of "over four hundred commercial establishments carrying on trade" in the Congo Free State.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> The <em>Ville de Bruxelles</em>, "a pitchpine boat," was built and stationed on the Upper Congo River as part of an elaborate system that allowed for the transport of good from caravans onto boats for further delivery around the cataracts (rapids) near the falls.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Daumas, Berand, & Co. was another trading company operating on the river. Other important features of the map include various "native villages." As U.S. Commercial Agent for the Congo Free State, Mohun wanted the United States to understand the complexities facing American merchants seeking additional access to the lucrative trade in the Upper Congo region near Stanley Falls.</p>
