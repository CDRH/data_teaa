<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This map of Africa appeared in the June 1898 issue of the Seventh-Day Adventist organ, <em>The Missionary Magazine</em>. The map depicts the continent as partitioned among European powers, with the exception of Liberia and Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Lacking a legend, the map does not contain as much detail about imperialism in Africa as contemporaneous maps. It identifies territories controlled by Spain, Great Britain, Germany, Portugal, and Italy. The map does not identify Ottoman imperial holdings in Africa.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> Sprinkled across the map are a few names of African groups; for example, the Khoikhoi (referred to using the derogatory term "Hottentots") and the Gallas (or Oromo). Much of the map omits the realities of complex African political and cultural formations, even under imperial rule. Thus, it embodies American geographical knowledge of Africa framed by European imperial projects.</p>
