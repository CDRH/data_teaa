<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Mohun's map shows the region from Stanley Falls (now Boyoma Falls) to Basoko, a town on the Congo River in the present-day Tshopo Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The distance between Basoko and Stanley Falls was 130 miles. Basoko became the "the centre of administration at the mouth of the Aruwimi river" after Belgian forces, with the aid of Mohun, expelled the Arabs from the region. Basoko was also conveniently located by river currents whose velocity facilitated speedy trade up and down the river.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> As U.S. Commercial Agent for the Congo Free State, Mohun provided the State Department with intelligence on the changing commercial landscape of the area once the State Forces took control of the 130-miles stretch of land, allowing various private companies to set up trading posts along the Upper Congo.</p>
