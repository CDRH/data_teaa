  <p>This political cartoon depicts Prince Albert of Belgium meeting with a Congolese man from the Belgian Congo colony. The African man calls attention to the economic losses that Belgium has suffered due to World War I as a result of the German invasion and occupation of the country. The country's main source of income from the African colony derived from the sale of rubber. However, the mutilation of Congolese workers who did not meet their rubber harvesting quota under the rule of King Leopold left these men and women unable to labor for the economic health of the colonizer. African Americans including George Washington Williams and William Sheppard helped expose the atrocities committed against the Congolese during Leopold's reign when the colony was the Congo Free State.</p>
