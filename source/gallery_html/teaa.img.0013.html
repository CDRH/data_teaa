  <p>In "<em>The Star of Ethiopia</em>," an article immediately following this image in the December 1915 issue of <em>The Crisis</em>, W. E. B. Du Bois recounts the skepticism that initially greeted his decision to stage a greatly expanded version of his pageant in Washington, D.C., "the largest Negro City in the northern hemisphere," in 1915: "A thousand actors gowned and trained in three weeks? 'Impossible!'" Yet despite the artistic, logistical, and financial challenges, he was delighted with what had been achieved: "I shall never forget that last night. Six thousand human faces looked down from the shifting blaze of lights and on the field the shimmering streams of colors came and went, silently, miraculously save for the great cloud of music that hovered over them and enveloped them. It was no mere picture: it was reality."</p>
