<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Bulawayo is located in present-day Zimbabwe and was incorporated in 1897. Historically, it was "the chief city of Matabeleland."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> "Between 1896 and 1898, a devastating cattle panzootic of rinderpest killed over 95 percent of African herds throughout Southern Africa," leading to widespread famine throughout the region.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> In Bulawayo, specifically, ox-driven wagons containing needed supplies and other commodities were found abandoned because the cattle died or "dropped dead." Colonial officials and missionaries used the resulting famine to further their goals: to force Africans to work on colonial projects to "earn" food and to coerce Africans into converting to Christianity, respectively. Some missionaries (including Americans) cast the rinderpest epidemic as divine intervention in response to African rejection of the Western civilizing mission.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> This photo does not capture the interplay between the colonial authorities and missionaries who manipulated the famine to further subordinate the local African population. The viewer sees starving, helpless Africans who do not seem to exert agency in seeking solutions to the ongoing famine. However, the historical record reveals that Africans sought remedies to the famine and resisted attempts by white people to impress them for labor.</p>
