<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Born in Indiana in 1892, raised in West Virginia, and a 1910 graduate of the Collegiate Institute of West Virginia, Richard Lonsdale Brown moved to New York City where he impressed W. E. B. Du Bois and was the subject of a lengthy March 1912 <em>New York Times</em> article entitled "Negro Youth Amazes Artists by His Talent." His paintings appeared on the cover of <em>The Crisis</em> multiple times, including the Easter and Christmas issues for 1912. He began working on art connected with what would become known as <em>The Star of Ethiopia</em> in 1911 and was actively involved in the New York (1913), Washington (1915), and Philadelphia (1916) productions of the pageant. He died in 1917, never having received the support and acclaim that Du Bois and others believed he deserved.</p>
