<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>The title of this image is a play on a portion of the verse Matthew 2:15 in the <em>Holy Bible</em>, which states: "Out of Egypt have I called my son." The biblical story focuses on the flight of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus from Bethlehem to Egypt, where they remained until the death of Herod. This issue of the <em>Crisis</em> was dedicated to "the black soldier," which included the "nearly 100,000" African American soldiers "called to arms for the United States," "the million dark men of Africa and India" who served in the British army, and "the equal, if not larger" number of "dark men" who fought for France and other Allies (60). This picture is of African troops impressed into service by the French colonial government during World War I. The African soldiers march behind a French officer. The photo is part of a series of pictures depicting Black troops, supporting the magazine's prediction that the Great War would lead to full enfranchisement and citizenship rights for African Americans, as well as decolonization&#8212;"Africa for Africans." The visual and political symmetry between American men of "Negro descent" and African men echoes Pan-Africanist ideologies and Black internationalism of the period.</p>
