  <p>Ernest J. Lyon was appointed American Minister to Liberia by Theodore Roosevelt in 1903. Born in Belize in 1860, Lyon immigrated to the United States with his family in 1870. He was serving as pastor of John Wesley United Methodist Church in Baltimore, Maryland, when he was tapped for the position in Liberia. He served for seven years, returning to the church in 1910 after his tenure in Africa ended. In 1903, Lyon faced criticism for suggesting that "indiscriminate immigration" of African Americans to Liberia should cease because the country was not in a condition to welcome them. While he supported the African nation, he believed African Americans were deserving of their citizenship in the United States. He observed: "I would rather be a Negro than anything else and to be where the struggle is the fiercest. The hope of triumph through manly endeavors should furnish inspiration to endure hardships as a good soldier and citizen." Nonetheless, he continued to work on behalf of the country, lobbying the United States government to pay more attention to a nation whose history was so tied to its own.</p>
