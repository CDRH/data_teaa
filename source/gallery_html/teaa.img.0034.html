<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Featured in this picture is John Tengo Jabavu from South Africa, accompanying an article on the 1911 International Congress of the Races. Held in London, the congress sought to examine relations between the "West" and the "East," or in the words of W. E. B. DuBois, "the so-called whites and so-called coloured peoples," to better understand each other. The September issue of <em>The Crisis</em> devoted a cover and a featured article to the conference which chronicled events. Jabavu was profiled, most likely because of his talk on the Native Races of South Africa, which would have been of interest to the magazine's readers concerned with race relations in South Africa.</p>

<p>Jabavu was born in 1859. Active as a journalist, he was editor of the Xhosa newspapers, <em>Isigidimi samaXhosa</em> ("The Xhosa Messenger") and <em>Imvo Zabantsundu</em> ("Black Opinion"). His speech at the Congress chronicled the history of Black South Africans before European arrival and their treatment by European settlers. His solution to the race problem was education.</p>
