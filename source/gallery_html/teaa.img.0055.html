<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This photograph shows the cemetery for the deceased missionaries of the Wesleyan Methodist Church's Kunso missionary station in Sierra Leone. It appears in Anna Boardman Smith's missionary narrative <em>Glimpses into African Mission Life</em> published in 1911. Smith stated the purpose of her book was to "increase...interest in foreign missions throughout" her denomination. The picture was a stark reminder that many missionaries did not return to their home countries and were often buried in Africa. The caption includes the names of the missionaries, but not those of the African children marked by grave sites 7 and 8. Not surprisingly, the missionary narrative follows that genre's convention of emphasizing the conversion of children to Christianity and the work undertaken in the mission school. In Smith's narrative, the only children named are those who stand out; for example, the children of kings and chiefs. Smith tells of a prince (the king's son) who attended the school, whereupon the missionaries renamed him "Henry Johnston after the man who founded the mission" (85). Other children received Anglicized names from the missionaries to signal their journey from supposed "heathendom" (49) or the "darkness of heathenism" (59) to Christianity. Renaming people was a constitutive practice of imperialist interactions with indigenous peoples.</p>
