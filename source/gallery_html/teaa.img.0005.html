<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This map accompanies the article "Once 'Dark Continent' Now a Fighting Ground for the Old World Powers&#8212;Civilization Pushing Its Way to the Interior," which summarizes the scramble for Africa on the cusp of the turn of the century. The map identifies six European nations vying for "primacy in the once dark continent," highlighting areas "where fighting is going on," presumably between Europeans and Africans. It depicts "wedges of civilization" representing Great Britain, France, Portugal, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The Congo Free State has no European affiliation, despite its Belgian colonial administration. The article, while recounting the various European campaigns to control parts of Africa, inserts the United States into the narrative in two ways. First, it alludes to Henry Morton Stanley&#8212;a British-born immigrant to America&#8212;who "carried the flag of the United States from the west coast to the east" of Africa. Second, it alludes to the fact that the United States was the first nation to recognize the sovereignty of the Congo Free State. The article firmly places America in Africa prior to 1899.</p>
