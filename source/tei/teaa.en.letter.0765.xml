<p>Annoyances suffered by the Honorable

<note>No. 70.</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Goree-Dakar, October 9, 1887</p>

<p>Honorable James D. Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to here-inclose
copy of a letter by the Honorable Charles
H. J. Taylor which reached me at 9.30 A.M.
yesterday from the British S. S. "Fez" anchored
off Dakar. This steamer arrived at Goree
the morning of the 7th at about 8 o'clock
from Monrovia, Liberia; obtained permission
to go alongside the <del>hulk</del> coal-hulk which
is anchored on the side of the bay nearest
to Dakar; had a visa attached to her bill
of health; and continued on to the hulk
while taking her coal, the health-boat
came alongside (neither the Medical Officer
nor Harbor-master appearing) and the negroes
in her asked for the bill of Health
which on being given to them they carried
on shore. From that moment the "Fez" was
subjected to many annoyances according
to all on board and some of the procedures

<pb facs="20170619_142313"/>

and non-procedures of the Authorities
were serious, more especially as she had
the Belgian mail on board. Our Honorable
Minister of course suffered these
trials with the rest and I at once repaired
alongside where I had the
pleasure of seeing and speaking
with him and of hearing the Captain's
story which was corroborated
by all. I could not go on board
for she was in quarantine, although
there was no Guard there from the 
shore as is usual.</p>

<p>The Captain,
Augustus Kent, appeared to me to be
a thorough gentleman and as his
story coincides with that inclosed
I will not use time to repeat it for
the mail leaves in half an hour.
He sent on shore four times for his
bill of health in order to continue on 
his voyage but it was each time
refused (this is denied on shore) Neither
was the vessel formally declared in
quarantine (also denied) This fact
produced an unfortunate <sic>occurence</sic>
There is at this season for arrivals from
the south a quarantine of five days.
Two

<pb facs="20170619_142321"/>

French passengers, unaware of the fact,
went on shore and all over the town
where a fever of excitement was produced
as it was claimed that the
steamer had wilfully violated
the quarantine regulations and
the affair was laid before the
State prosecution.</p>

<p>To make matters
worse, the British Vice Consul,
who, by the by, is a Frenchman,
and despises the English as much
as any one else here instead of 
trying to arrange the business did
everything to complicate matters
and to discomfit the Britishers. He
had already made up his mind 
before having even spoken with the
captain.</p>

<p>Therefore, to assist
Mr. Taylor, I availed myself of
the good relations which I have
always been fortunate enough to
keep with the authorities and aid
all in my power without interfering
in British matters and the bill 
of health was finally given up
to the ship. There are a variety
of lesser charges each with two
<catchwords>sides</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170619_142328"/>

sides, but it would be useless to speak
of them all as none are proven. What
I have written as far as I am able
to know as this moment I believe to
be correct. No doubt that some part
of the difficulties were caused by
misunderstandings bu they were just
the same unfortunate.</p>

<p>The "Fez" left for Teneriffe
last night at nine o'clock with Mr.
Taylor in good health. All claims
against the vessel captain &amp; owners
will be settled in Europe.</p>

<p>With an apology for this hastily
written dispatch,<lb/>
I am, Sir, with esteem<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
George Strickland<lb/>
Vice-Consul</p>

<p>Off Goree<lb/>
S.S. Fez.</p>

<p>Hon. Peter Strickland
U.S. Consul for 
Goree and Dakaar</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to 
inform you, that I am on board the
S.S. "Fez" delayed by a procedure which
in my opinion is wholly illegal and
without precedent, unless said precedent
has been laid at this place.
On Oct 7th 1887 at 8.20 A.M. we arrived
off Goree, our bill of Health was
sent ashore and was <unclear extent="one word"/> and
returned, Capt Kent, who is in command
of this steamer being out of
coal and desiring sufficient to arrive
at Teneriffe got permission
from Goree to go alongside the "Hulk" 
the same being a coal vessel, in the Stream off Dekar. The Capt. proceeded
to load twenty tons of coal the amount
necessary, to bring us to Teneriffe. A 
lot of negroes came alongside and
asked for papers, the captain believing

<pb facs="20170619_142409"/>

there would be no difficulty
sent the "papers" when lo and 
behold, that whilst we were allowed
to pass Goree, coming 2 miles further
caused the unfortunate
predicament upon us, of meeting
a little French Doctor, who pretends
by word of mouth from 3rd parties
to have us under quarantine
for (5) five days. To me this appears
very outrageous. We got no notice
of said quarantine until the hour
of 8 P.M. of the 7th inst. The Doctor
who <unclear>institutes</unclear> the quarantine
has never been alongside the
vessel to take observations in
<sic>refference</sic> to our healthful condition
we have no communication whatever
with the land, we cannot
send telegram, get provisions,
receive more than 200 pieces of
washing which was left at <sic>Dekar</sic>
nor nothing else. We have been
subjected to nothing but insults.
If we starved and famished for

<pb facs="20170619_142418"/>

food and water, it would excite
no aid or even pity from the 
Dekarites. But this is not all
&amp; as the Consul General and 
Minister Resident of our liberal 
Government, to foreigners, the
United States, am on leave of
absence from my post Monrovia
Liberia, making my way to Washington
D.C. <unclear>Doubly</unclear> armed with
"passport official" and behind me
the International Law, which
presents to me perfect immunity,
from molestation of any kind. I am
told by a little French <sic>Commissionair</sic>
of Police, that he cares not
who I am, I shall have no communication
with land. I shall 
be extremely obliged to call upon
you to intercede at once in
Dekar on my behalf. You will
please do me the kindness to
come aboard, that I may see you
and fully give information, and
take such other steps, as may
<catchwords>secure</catchwords>

<pb facs="20170619_142445"/>

secure my rights, yours and our successor.</p>

<p>I am in haste to arrive
in the states, hoping and trusting
that you may at once
take immediate "steps" in this
matter, I am your obedient servant</p>

<p>Chas. H. J. Taylor<lb/>
U.S. Minister Resident and
Consul General to Liberia</p>
