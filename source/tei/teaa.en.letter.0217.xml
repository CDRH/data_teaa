<p>1039 Lombard Street<lb/>
Philadelphia, Pa.<lb/>
November 25th 1890.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>In the short interview with which 
you honored me, on Friday last, I 
informed you that I was commissioned
by the President of Liberia to approach 
your Government, with the hope that 
you would be induced to make 
such a demonstration in our favor 
as will prevent foreign nations from 
making encroachments on our territory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me the pressure 
of business did not permit of your 
giving me time to lay before you the 
facts, and you told me to call again 
the next day, which I did, and I called 
again on the following Monday and 
Tuesday but with no better success
owing to the great pressure of business 
in your office.</p>

<p>As I had to leave your city and on 
<catchwords>Tuesday</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honorable James G. Blaine<lb/> 
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</fw>

<pb n="20170616_150607"/>

Tuesday last, I make bold to adopt 
this method of laying the matter before 
you, trusting that you will be kind enough 
to give it your consideration.</p>

<p>In the year 1885 a French Man of
War came into the harbor of our Capital,
Monrovia, and the Commander called upon
the President. During the conversation
the Commander said that he had stopped 
at Bereby &#8212; a place within our boundary
line &#8212; and had an interview with the 
chiefs. The President asked, Why did 
you stop them and have that interview,
Do you not know that territory belongs to 
Liberia?" The Commander replied that
he did not know that it belonged to 
Liberia, and that he had been instructed
by his Government to stop them and ban 
that interview.</p>

<p>After the departure of the vessel
the President instructed our Representative 
in Paris to call the attention of
the French Government <unclear>to</unclear> the action of 
their officer, and to point out the fact 
that our boundary on the South East,
extended to the San Pedro River, as you
will see by referring to the "Imperial Atlas"

<pb n="20170616_150612"/>

in your office, and that they had 
virtually admitted it by their Naval
Charts and otherwise.</p>

<p>The French Government then claimed
that they had Commercial 
Treaties with the chief of Bereby
as old as 1846, I think, but we have 
Deeds of Cession of that Territory 
made to us as far back as 1836 
or 1837.</p>

<p>We laid this matter before your
Government and asked for your 
kind offices; and in a Despatch 
to Mr. McLane, dated January 13th 
1886 Mr Bayard instructed him to 
interview, and to say to the French 
Government: "We exercise no protectorate
over Liberia, but the 
circumstances that that Republic 
originated through the colonization 
of American citizens, and was 
established under the fastening sanctions
of this Government, gives us the
right, as the next friend of 
Liberia, to aid her in preventing any
encroachments of Foreign powers 
on her territorial sovereignty, and 
in settling any dispute that may 
<catchwords>arise</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_150618"/>

arise. The Southeasterly boundary
at the River San Pedro has never been 
questioned and has the powerful sanction
of general admission for many years."</p>

<p>This matter has remained in abeyance 
as we suppose &#8212; since that time; but it 
lately came to our knowledge that one 
Captain Binger, who was a prominent 
officer in the late expedition against 
the King of Dahomey, claims to have 
made explorations in the rear and 
Southeast of Liberia; and he has published
in a "Supplement <sic>an</sic> Journal Le 
Temps, Mars 1890," a map representing 
Liberia as a very narrow strip along the 
Coast and representing the Country in 
the immediate rear of Liberia, as far as 
Musadu, as unexplored country, and 
liable to become a Protectorate of France 
although our Mr Benj Anderson had 
explored that country as far as Musadu
and published an account of his
journey &#8212; and cutting off our territory 
on the Southeast up to the Cavalla 
River, thus taking the very territory in 
dispute and which Mr. Bayard says
<catchwords>belongs</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_150624"/>

belongs to us by "The powerful sanction 
of general admission for many years."
The territory so taken from us is 
represented on his Map as French 
territory.</p>

<p>Whilst the French have not, as 
yet, made any open movement towards
taking possession of our 
territories, yet. Mr. Secretary, under 
these circumstances we feel warranted
in appealing to your 
Government as "Liberia's next Friend"
and asking you to make such a 
demonstration in our favor as
will prevent Foreign Governments 
from making such encroachments 
on our territory. If your powerful
Government would make a present 
of one of your smallest stream gun
boats to be used in Guarding our
Coast from foreigners and preventing 
them from settling at points remote 
from our civilized settlements, and 
tampering with the aboriginals, we 
feel that our territorial limits will 
not be encroached upon.</p>

<p>Mr Secretary my Government 

<pb n="20170616_150629"/>

believes that if you will be pleased
to give us the benefit of your kind 
offices, and will induce His Excellency, 
the President to recommend 
the giving of this vessel to Liberia 
we shall be successful; and the very 
recommendation by the President 
will indicate to the world the 
friendship of the United States for 
our Little Republic.</p>

<p>Trusting, Mr Secretary that 
you will bring this matter to the 
notice of his Excellency, the President,
and that you will advise his 
recommending it to Congress, and trusting
that you will pardon my trespassing 
on your valuable time.</p>

<closer><salute>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your honorable Servant</salute>
<signed>W. M. Davis<lb/> 
Liberian Commissioner</signed></closer>
