<p>Note.</p>

<p>As my consular correspondence and the Consular Regulations
are packed away in a trunk in the Custom House,

lack of the Regulations and the regular
Dispatch paper.</p>

<p>U.S. Commercial Agency<lb/>
at St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
Lisbon, July 24, 1891</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>
to the Hon. William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to report my
arrival at this port, en route to
St. Paul de Loanda, and to mention 
some of the difficulties met 
on this route.</p>

<p>1) The shortest, or rather quickest,
route to Angola (St. Paul de Loanda)
is that of the Portuguese mail,
provided one is able to find suitable
communication between England and

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0563.004"/>

Portugal. I had read of the project,
or decision, of having steamers sail
from Lisbon to Loanda on the 21st
and 6th of each month; but not being
sure, I determined to inquire in
New York. Here the Portuguese Consul
knew only of the departures on the 6th;
Cook's Agency <unclear>idem</unclear>. I sailed to 
England by first opportunity in
order to find out there, both about
the Lisbon packets for Loanda and
the steamers from England to Loanda.</p>

<p>2) In England I learnt that there 
is indeed a steamer leaving Lisbon
on the 21st and there I might
catch it by one of the Southampton
steamers, all of whom were due in Lisbon
about the some time.</p>

<p>3) The time for the connection being

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0563.005"/>

very limited, and the required
custom house despatches and visas
of Passport taking to much time,
the steamer of the 21st was missed
and I must wait for the next 
one of the 6th of August, which is
due in Loanda about the 1st of
September.</p>

<p>Besides the visa of the American
Consulate I was obliged to get
another from the Police of the Port
which cost 2.800 reis <unclear extent="one word"/> that
is a little over three dollars. My
baggage had to go through the same
process as that of non-consuls, and
I found that <del>most</del> Portuguese officials think
a Commercial Agent is nothing more
than a Consular Agent.</p>

<p>The result of my experience is that

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0563.006"/>

although the British and African lines
from Liverpool to Loanda is not the 
most direct nor the quickest in
theory (in the time actually spent
at sea) yet it is the most convenient 
both as regards speed,
comfort and economy, because the
correspondence between the steamer
from America and that going to 
Loanda can easily be arranged
from America, and there is no
custom house delay nor pass-port
expense etc., to the English
steamers do not call at Lisbon.</p>

<p>4) I am improving the fortnight I
am forced to spend here, in getting
useful information on the subject
of commercial possibilities between
my consulate and <del>Angola</del> America, and

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0563.007"/>

on the plains and purposes of the
colonial centre at Lisbon with regard
to this African colonies. In the present 
crisis, however, nobody knows
what may happen in the nearest
future.</p>

<p>I found the people at Oporto
deeply and seriously excited and
here the highest and lowest clans 
are, so to say carelessly, in response on the "<unclear extent="one word"/>"
looking out for "somebody to do
something or anything", but no one
knows who is to do it, nor what 
is to be done.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir, your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Commercial Agent</p>
