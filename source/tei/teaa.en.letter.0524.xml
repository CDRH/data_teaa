<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Loanda, December 5, 1888.</p>

<p>Honorable G. L. Rives,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to transmit
to the Department the Inventory
of the private effects of the lake Mr
Judson which I value at about
$100.00/100 to $120.00/100 if sold here.</p>

<p>His debts, as far as I can find
and through an advertisement I 
put in the papers here, are as
follows:</p>

<table>
<row>
<cell>Arias Fonseca &amp; Co. for food</cell>
<cell>$26 30/100</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>Restaurant Club " liquors</cell>
<cell>39 05/100</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>Tailor</cell>
<cell>2 93/100</cell>
</row>
<row>
<cell>Rest of Consulate</cell>
<cell>52 18/100</cell>
</row>
</table>

<p>Being for months April and May, not
paid, also for October and November</p>

<table>
<row>
<cell>Funeral expenses</cell>
<cell>84 35/100</cell>
</row>
</table>

<p>I think the rest of the Consulate
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0524.002"/>

and the Funeral Expenses (paid by
me) ought to be repaid to me by the
Department, the house having been
rented in the name of the Government, 
and I having assumed
the responsibility of the burial,
however I await the reply of the 
Department authorizing me to draw 
for the same.</p>

<p>A Mr. Steele has presented
himself from Cabinda, as co-manager
with Mr. Judson of Bishop Taylor's
mission there, Mr. Judson having 
been Superintendent of same. They
were also engaged in a small business
there together. Mr. MacLean of
Bishop Taylor's mission here, certifies
to the above description of Mr. Steele
and as he has a better opportunity
of selling the effects for better prices
there than we can get here, I intend
handing over to him such effects for
sale, he guaranteeing to hand to me 
the proceeds, as sold. I hope I
have done right in this as I am
<catchwords>afraid</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0524.003"/>

afraid if I were to sell them here
they would not bring the valve I
have placed on them as old clothes.</p>

<p>A wooden box also exists
belonging to a Sailor of an American
Whaler, name unknown, also a 
tin trunk marked No 5, supposed
to have been left by a man named 
Cameron when on a journey into 
the interior, and not yet claimed,
contents as per inventory.</p>

<p>I can find no account book
or letter book to show if any money
is owing to him, or if he had any 
account with any one here, and
no one has offered to pay me anything 
on his account in response
to my advertisement.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Robt S. Newton<lb/>
Vice Consul.</p>
