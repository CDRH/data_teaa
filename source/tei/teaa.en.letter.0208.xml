<p>You will at once see Sir, that the 
position which I now hold as Acting Consul 
without appointment <del>to</del> from the United 
States Government, but merely by the 
nomination of the Commodore before-named 
invests me in strict law with no actual 
legal authority. I am recognized as Acting 
Consul by the local Government, as it 
seems to me, merely through courtesy, and 
I cannot close my eyes to the fact, that, had 
I attempted to make any stand in 
opposition to the Government in recent cases 
of aggression by British Cruizers on 
American Vessels in the Coast, any further 
recognition whatever of me even through 
courtesy would have at once ceased.</p> 

<p>As you are aware, the several vessels 
seized on the Coast on the alleged ground 
of being engaged in the Slave Trade are 
all sent to this Colony for adjudication, 
or, I should rather observe for condemnation.</p>

<p>I stake the liberty of enclosing for your 
inspection a List of the Prizes taken by 
H. B. Majesty's Cruizers and sent into this Port. 
I will also mention that during the period 
I have been Acting Counsel there have 
arrived in this Port no fewer than 120 
American Vessels comprising a Tonnage of over 
25000 Tons, and with crews consisting of 
1100 men, exclusive of three United States 
Ships of War.</p>

<p>You will bear in mind Sir, that 
the British Government do not fail, to

<pb n="4"/>

maintain a Consul at Liberia, and it is 
I am sure almost unnecessary for me to 
remark that in point of comparison with 
Sierra Leone, Liberia sinks into insignificance.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I have disclosed 
to you I venture to submit for your 
consideration my lengthened service as 
Acting Consul and the inadequacy of 
pay I have received through fees alone 
and which have been considerably reduced 
by recent Acts of Congress.</p>

<p>I earnestly trust Sir, that you will see 
the urgent necessity for appointing a 
Consul at this place, and that in the 
exercise of your patronage, you will be 
pleased to confer such appointment on me 
with such salary as you may think 
proper to maintain the dignity of our 
great nation. </p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
With high respects,<lb/>
Your most obedt humble Servant<lb/>
Jno E Taylor<lb/>
Acting United States Consul.</p>
