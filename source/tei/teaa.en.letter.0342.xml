<note>Department of State Received Aug 21 1884</note>

<p>"SS Japan," Lake Erie, Aug 19th 1884</p>

<p>Hon Secretary of State</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>

<p>My duties call me 
again to Gaboon, Africa. We expect to sail
from New York via Liverpool, Eng. the 
last of this month.</p>

<p>I shall be very glad to receive any 
special instructions from you addressed 
to 23 Centre St N.Y. or I will go to Washington
if necessary.</p>

<p>The situation there as it appears to 
me and our fellow missionaries seems 
to warrant French aggression and accession 
of territory; and I firmly believe 
that they will not rest content until 
the Congo country is under their control.
In <unclear extent="one word"/> of this I have felt
that it might be will for our government

<pb n="20170615_145258"/>

to send to Gaboon some one who might 
give his whole attention to this matter
and, while in this country, have been 
on the look out for some one whom
I could recommend. A few weeks 
ago I met a young man, whom I 
formerly knew in college, a young 
man of sterling christian character
and marked ability, who expressed 
himself of willing to spend a few 
years there. I therefore recommend 
Royal F. King, nephew of Hon. Wm
King of Minnesota, either for the 
position with which you have <unclear>honored</unclear> 
me, which I will gladly resign and 
accept the Vice Commercial Agency 
or to any position you might 
see fit to appoint him. He has seen
some service, under the Department 
of the Interior, among the Indians
where the temptations to young men 
are similar to those on the coast 
and I therefore recommend him

<pb n="20170615_145449"/>

as a tried and true man. His 
address is Duluth, Minnesota, and 
if he should receive an appointment 
he could be ready to start for Africa 
within three months.</p>

<p>I have the honor to remain<lb/> 
Your obedient Servant<lb/> 
Graham C. Campbell<lb/>
U.S. Commercial Agent<lb/> 
of Gaboon West Africa.</p>

<p>P.S. There are needed of the Agency, nearly 
all the blank forms necessary in making 
our a "ships papers" a common 
of Stationary, and two flags - one,
about a 12 ft. flag, for the flag pole, 
and a small one for the boat 
about 2 ft in length</p>

<p>Graham C. Campbell</p>
