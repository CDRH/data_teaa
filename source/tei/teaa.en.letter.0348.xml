<note>No. 122.</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Zanzibar December 16, 1889.</p>

<p>Mr Pratt<lb/>
To the Dept of State</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Claim of Dr. B. F. Wilson</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents</p>

<p>Referring to copy of treaty
of Johanna with France.</p>

<p>Prohibiting of the abandonment 
of his estate by Dr Wilson</p>

<note>No. 122.</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Zanzibar December 16 1889</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Watson<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose
herein a copy (in Arabic) of
the original treaty entered
into April 22, 1886 between
the King of Johanna and the
commandant of Mayotte acting 
for the President of the
French Republic.</p>

<p>I also enclose copies of
correspondence between Dr.
B. F. Wilson and the French
Resident at Johanna concerning 
the importation by the
King of an extra tax on the laborers
on the Wilson Estate.</p>

<p>With regard to the
case of Dr Wilson His
affairs and now in a most
<catchwords>critical</catchwords>

<pb n="151321"/>

critical condition, and unless
some relief is afforded him
without delay, he will of
necessity be compelled to
abandon his estate and
thus see the labor of years
brought to naught.</p>

<p>His principal indebtedness
is to partners in
Mauritius: and it must
be borne in mind that this
debt has all been contracted 
since the year 1880. owing
to the obstruction of his
business by the King.</p>

<p>A small amount (Rs 25000)
is due to a British subject
at Zanzibar who is about
taking legal steps to recover
the same through this
consulate.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to be informed 
by the Department
as to what action should be
taken by this Consulate in
<catchwords>the matter</catchwords>.</p>

<pb n="151327"/>

<p>in the matter.</p>

<p>An attachment on the
estate of Dr Wilson would
virtually wind up his affairs 
since the Mauritius
conditions would stop all
advances for the working
of the property and would
levy for the <unclear extent="one word"/> of
their claims.</p>

<p>Awaiting the instructions
of the Department</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Seth A Pratt<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<p>Patty Estate<lb/>
Johanna 13 August 1889</p>

<p>Monsieur le Docteur <unclear extent="one word"/><lb/>
Resident du France<lb/>
Anjouan</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Upon this estate we are suffering for the want
of labour to carry on the work, and this I am sorry
to say is carried by ill treatment of those who do work
for me by the Sultan.</p>

<p>You are well aware that His Highness the Sultan made
a written engagement with me to supply me with all
of the labour I required before I consented to remain
upon this island. This engagement he has never
kept with me. On the contrary since 1882 he has
he has constantly tried to deprive me of labour and
ruin my prospects. When the U.S.S. "Juinata" was
here in September 1885 making an enquiry into my
complaints the Sultan faithfully promised Commander
Harrington that he would desist from disturbing my
labour, and allow any and all people to work for
me without hindrance. He also made the same
promise to Captain Potter of the U.S.S. "Lancaster" in
April 1886 but the Sultan has not kept his word and
faith with either one of these Officers, and my labour
has constantly been interfered with, and these free
people who dare to work for me are so taxed that
they can have one object in working. Whereas I have 
<catchwords>not working for me</catchwords>

<pb n="151446"/>

not working for me are only <unclear extent="four words"/>
and on half such. There are many <unclear extent="four words"/>
here to work but are <unclear extent="five words"/>
and <unclear extent="about seven words"/>
to work for me. For this reason, <unclear extent="three words"/>
of the <unclear extent="one word"/> have the island <unclear extent="four words"/>
At Mohilla, Grand Comore Mayotte &amp;c</p>

<p>I have on other occasions brought this to the
notice of your predecessor (Resident) but no note
has no been taken of my complaints. I am
now asking of you if you cannot interfere on
my behalf, and if the people who wish to work
and beg to request that they pay no more taxes than
others and that the over paid taxes be <unclear>refunded</unclear>
to them. These free people decline to work now for
the only reason that they will be made to pay five
dollars instead of one and one half dollars. Some
who have worked here and had <unclear extent="one word"/> the money
demanded of them have had their <unclear extent="two words"/> from
them. The Sultan has said that all workers
for me must pay five dollars and that is only to
deprive me of my labour and ruin me <unclear extent="two words"/>.</p>

<p>I am sending this by two of my <unclear extent="one word"/>
who can affirm to what I say and if further proof
is necessary I will send all of the men but beg that
you will guarantee that they will not be <unclear extent="one word"/> by
His Highness for giving evidence against him.</p>

<p>Trusting that you will give this serious attention<lb/>
I am<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
B. F. Wilson</p>
