<p>Consulate of the United States 
of America at Bathurst Gambia<lb/>
15th December 1860.</p>
    
<p>Sir:</p>

<p>My report of last
year was upon the trade and the 
commerce of Gambia, as shown by
statistics of 1858. I now purpose to 
make the Returns of 1859, the basis 
of this annual report.</p>
    
<p>I have also the pleasure of adding the
report from the district of Sierra Leone 
Henry Rider Esqr Consular Agent.</p>
    
<p>The year 1859 was not 
a favorable one to the commerce of 
Gambia. The crops were short; importations 
were more limited than in
the preceding year and consequently 
the Customs revenue showed a deficiency 
as compared with recent previous 
years, and above all, sickness prevailed
<catchwords>for</catchwords>
    
<fw type="address">To The Honorable Lewis Cass<lb/>
Secretary of State of the United States<lb/>
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</fw>
    
<pb n="20170616_100338"/>
    
for a season, robbing the commercial
community of many members.</p>
    
<p>The deficiency in the 
crop of Ground Nuts, the chief article
of export, was nearly one half as 
compared with 1858 and about
1500 tons below the average of the 
past twelve years (1848 to 1859
inclusive): this too, when, in the 
first few years, the article was but
a new one, and not extensively cultivated, 
or eagerly sought after.</p>
    
<p>It is partially accounted for by the 
scarcity of rain in the previous "rainy
season," the internal was among the 
native tribes, who are the only cultivators, 
and the poor state of the soil
arising from renewed plantings
without proper treatment and the 
impoverishing effects of the extraordinary 
crop of 15.728 tons of the previous year.</p>
    
<p>Hides, too, for seasons not 
so easily explained, show a decrease
of thirteen thousand nine hundred 
<catchwords>and</catchwords>
    
<pb n="20170616_100355"/>
    
and ninety seven as compared with 
the yield of the <sic>preceeding</sic> year; (which
was but little better than the average 
of the last twelve years. May not this
have arisen, in a measure, from the 
same internal wars and consequent 
loss of the hides of cattle consumed
by the combatants, which in Peace
would have been carefully preserved
and finally found their way to this
market?</p>
    
<p>Bees-wax, the third article 
of export also shows a deficit of 25
tons, in comparison with 1858.</p>
    
<p>The quality of the Gambia 
Ground Nut surpasses that of any
produced, and the trade of the place
depends very materially upon that
fact. It has been observed
by some of the oldest merchants
here, with much concern, that,
the quality is depreciating. The neighboring 
rivers <unclear extent="one word"/>, Jeba, and 
Rio Grande and the environs of
Sierra Leone produce the Ground Nut
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_100402"/>
    
in large quantities but of quality, inferior
to "Gambias", both as regards their outward
appearance (important as an article of 
export to the United States) and their
intrusive oleaginous properties (upon which 
their value for European markets is solely
based). This deprecation in
quality is mainly owing to the fact that 
many of the tribes, particularly those who
cultivate them in the River below McCarthy's
Island have adopted the more speedy
mode of threshing instead of picking by
hand: whereby the Nuts are mixed with 
leaves, stalks, stones, and other <unclear extent="one word"/>
substances, causing large deductions in
the French market and depreciating their 
value in the United States as an article of 
food.</p>
   
<p>The present Governor 
of this Colony Colonel d'Arcy, well aware
of the importance of sustaining the reputation 
of this our principal export has most
wisely endeavored to counteract the baneful
effects of this mode of harvesting, by calling 
together the chiefs of the neighboring tribes
<catchwords>and</catchwords> 

<pb n="20170616_100421"/>

and pointing out to them the certain,
final, disastrous result of the system
from which they derive a small
temporary benefit.</p>

<p>To bring it more forcibly to their
minds His Excellency proposes to
have agricultural fairs held in the 
neighborhood where monetary
prizes will be awarded for the best
quality of all agricultural productions.</p>

<p>The first is to take place in March,
and although a novelty in Africa
I cannot but think, that it will
have the desired, beneficial effect.</p>

<p>Added to all the commercial
troubles of 1859: we were
visited in the latter part of July
by that scourge, the yellow-fever which
made fearful ravages in our small
European community. So free had
this coast previously been from every
species of epidemic that it was a
matter of congratulation, that, though
living in one of the most unhealthy
<catchwords>climates</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_100427"/>

climates of the globe, we escaped 
the frightful effects of epidemics in 
other more favored, and more
healthy climes. The first death was
on the twenty third of July, from 
that time to its cessation in September 
we lost twenty three persons 
out of an European population of 
seventy two.</p>
    
<p>In "Commercial Regulations"
there is one important change note,
on the eighteenth of April 1860 a new 
Colonial ordinance was enacted
relative to port charges: the particulars 
of which are as follows:</p>

<p>"Upon all ships, boats &amp; vessels, canoes 
alone excepted, of more than five tons 
whether British or Foreign and whether
registered or not in the port of Bathurst
entering the River Gambia or employed 
or plying within the limits thereof 
a Quarantine fee of Twenty one
shillings in each year payable on
her first entrance into the port of 
Bathurst. Provided always that all
<catchwords>vessels</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_100432"/>
    
vessels employed solely in the 
River Gambia shall not be liable 
to pay the said Quarantine Fee.
Upon all ships, boats, or vessels of
more than fifteen (15) tons whether 
British or Foreign &amp; whether registered 
or not in the port of Bathurst
while solely employed within the 
River Gambia a duty of one
shilling per ton, registered tonnage 
shall be paid to the Collector
of Customs on or before the 31st day 
of January for the current year:
provided always that upon
any such vessel proceeding
<unclear>outtide</unclear> to pay the additional
one shilling per ton.</p>
    
<p>All vessels over fifteen (15) tons 
whether British or Foreign &amp;c
&amp;c shall pay two shillings per
registered ton once in every year.
Vessels that have paid the 
one shilling &amp; nine pence per 
ton (the former sake of tonnage)
during the current year shall

<pb n="20170616_100437"/>
    
pay three pence additional to 
make up the two shillings."</p>
    
<p>Vessels desirous of
entering the River Gambia have 
for the past six years suffered
much inconvenience from the 
fact that Bird Island at the 
mouth of the River &amp; one of the 
principal points mentioned in  
the sailing directions has been
gradually sinking and for three
years has not been visible at high
tides: there was formerly a Flag-staff 
on this island devoting the 
pilot station, which navigators
were particularly requested to note
as a guide: all this has disappeared.
The pilots now remain in their 
boat anchored off the old side of 
the Island. Vessels approaching 
the entrance should endeavor to 
make the outer or Red Buoy placed
in 1859 on the Red Bank in five &amp;
a half (5 1/2) fathoms of water (<unclear>Mud</unclear>)
at the third hour of flood tide
(<unclear>Neap</unclear>)

<pb n="20170616_100408"/>
    
(<unclear>Neap</unclear>): it bears some Bird Island
spit West by North three quarters North
distance two &amp; a half miles and from 
the Black Buoy South East half South
ten &amp; a half miles by Massey's <unclear extent="one word"/>
Log.</p>
    
<p>The bearings of the Black Buoy (for
which vessels should steer upon
leaving the Red Buoy) and its 
situation are as follows: it is placed
on the north end of African Knoll
in two and a half fathoms of water
(springs) and its bearings are
Cape St. Mary West by South 
half South. Tower at Bathurst 
South half West. Fort Bullen
South by East one quarter East and 
middle of <unclear extent="one word"/> Creek East 
three quarters North. All the bearings
by compass.</p>
    
<p>I beg, now, to call
your attention to the annexed tabular
statements Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<p>By reference to No. 1 you will observe
that the value of the Imports &amp; Exports 
<catchwords>for</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_100414"/>

for 1858 greatly exceeds that of 1859, the
only exception being the exports to the
United States which are slightly in
excess.</p>

<p>Number 2 shows the principal articles
of importation, the countries furnishing
them and their amounts in comparison
with the previous year; it will be observed
that more tobacco was furnished by
direct importation from the United
States than in the former year.</p>

<p>Table Number 3 gives the Exports, their
destination and quantities as compared
with 1858. The excess of 1858
cannot but be noticed.</p>

<p>In Number 4 you have the Exports
for the past twelve years, the 
number of vessels entered during the
year 1859 and the number of American
vessels entered for the past three
years.</p>

<p>It is well known that
the slave trade and the means used
for suppressing it tends in a great
<catchwords>measure</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_100344"/>
    
measure to impede the <sic>developement</sic>
of American trade on this Coast.</p>
    
<p>Unfortunately many of the articles required 
in legitimate commerce are 
used also in the slave-trade, namely
Rum, lumber, empty casks for Palm
Oil and spice: many instances have 
occured where vessels pursuing a 
legitimate voyage have suffered detention 
and been subject to trial on suspicion
of being slavers, thereby breaking up
the voyage and causing only loss to 
owners. I can mention two cases in this
colony the "S. W. Nash" and the "Mary Varney"
and in Sierra Leone. The "Thomas Watson"
and the "Carolina."</p>
    
<p>The means for suppressing the slave-trade 
it is evident are not effectual
notwithstanding the <unclear extent="one word"/> expenditure
by Great Britain and the United States 
in maintaining a costly squadron and 
in attempting to blockade this coast:
for it is notorious that, in the past
twelve months more slaves have been 
shipped than ever before. And why?</p>
   
<pb n="20170616_100349"/>
   
<p>for the simple mercantile axiom of Demand and Supply <del>that</del>
for the demand has been great, for the 
Cuban market: and as long as that
demand continues, as long as the 
profits on a single cargo are so immense 
that one successful voyage
out of six is remunerative, men will
be found sufficiently <del>bold</del> daring to 
undertake and sufficiently bold to
successfully carry out the voyage.</p>   
 
<p>The Cuban market now, alone, remains.
Destroy that market and the slave 
trade ceases to exist, if that is impossible 
why not blockade the 
coast of Cuba? the point of destination,
a far more feasible plan than to attempt 
to blockade half the continent of Africa!
The law of nations may not permit
but cannot England, France and 
the United States in the name of 
humanity insist that Spain shall
make a treaty to that effect?</p>
    
<p>Is England anxious to carry out 
such a course? Does she not desire
more benefit by the present mode of 
suppression
     
<pb n="20170616_100447"/>
    
than by the one proposed above?
"Liberated Africans" furnish her with
soldiers for her three West India
Regiments, laborers for her African
Colonies, laborers for her possessions
in the West Indies!</p>
    
<p>The United States maintain 
a squadron of one hundred &amp;
thirteen guns and what benefit 
do we devise? None. no soldiers,
no laborers, our legitimate trade
harassed and our flag often subject
to insult.</p>
    
<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient &amp; humble servant<lb/> 
Danl R. B. Upton<lb/>
U.S. Consul.</p>

<p>Sierra Leone District<lb/>
Yearly Report<lb/>
Henry Rider</p>
   
<p>Consular Agent</p>

<p>Freetown the port of entry for the Colony
of Sierra Leone West Africa, lies in Lat 8" 29'
N. and Long 13" 14' W. It is a place of some 
note and has been <unclear extent="one word"/> the metropolis of 
this particular part of the coast. The port 
contains some six or seven thousand inhabitants 
and the census taken before the late
epidemic returns nearly forty thousand 
people in the colony. The exports of the place
are ground nuts, hides, palm oil, camwood,
beniseed, palm kernels, bees wax, ivory and
native gold. Ground nuts and beniseed
find their principal market in France and 
are almost wholy shipped in French <unclear>bottoms</unclear>,
palm oil, palm kernels, and bees wax, are
also shipped to France but in smaller
quantities. Palm oil and hides are the 
principal exports to the United States, besides
which small quantities of ground nut,
camwood and ivory are occasionally
shipped, these freight are confined to

<pb n="20170616_100721"/>
    
to American vessels. England presents a
market for all the exports of the colony in a quarter 
or less degree. The imports are Tobacco in
hogshead, rum, provisions, and a few dry
goods, from the United States, dry goods and
provisions of every description from England
dry goods, <unclear extent="one word"/>, and liquors, from France.
The port does not present a flourishing condition, 
on the contrary a stranger is impressed 
with the idea of decay and want
of activity, the streets are grass-grown with
but little travel through them, and there are 
dilapidated houses, and lots overrun with 
weeds to be met with at every step; the black
population, with some exceptions, are very
poor and inactive, preferring to remain about 
town earning perhaps enough for a single
meal, to living in the village and cultivating 
the land, which with a moderate amount 
of labor would remunerate them handsomely;
the exceptions are generally liberated Africans,
who by strict economy and much shrewdness
have accumulated money and are, with the 
few Europeans, the business men of the place,
the apathy before spoken of however, is entirely

<pb n="20170616_100726"/>
    
entirely confined to appearances, for the commercial 
interests of the place are of considerable
importance, the revenues have increased steadily 
for some years past denoting a corresponding 
increase in the commerce of the colony, the amount 
of business done with United States
is not inconsiderable as the following returns
for 1859 will show</p>

<p>The returns for 1860 I have not been able to 
obtain.</p>
    
<p>The commerce with France is much more 
important than that of the United States, and
the business done with England is very great,
beside many sailing vessels there is a monthly line
of Steamers freighting and there cannot supply
the demand of the port for English good, most 
every packet leaves merchandise behind for want
    
<pb n="20170616_100732"/>
    
want of room.</p> 

<p>A serious drawback to the rapid growth of the colony,
and a heavy burden on the merchants is the very 
high tariff of duties imposed upon goods imported, 
many tons of merchandise are now taken to 
the rivers, which with a more liberal tariff would
find their way direct to Freetown, enclosed I forward 
a copy of the table of duties. Vessels pay
a tonnage duty of one shilling and six pence and 
have the privilege of leaving and returning to 
the port a number of times in the same voyage
providing they are not absent over two months at
any one time, a further charge of three pence a
ton is collected as light dues vessels are also
subject to a harbor master's fee of one pound
sterling for vessels of 100 to 150 tons, and ten
shillings for each 50 tons over.</p>
    
<p>The currency of the colony is that of England,
the sterling pounds, shillings, and pence, all
dollars (silver) are current at par value. Spanish 
and American gold pass at a small discount.
French twenty franc pieces command a small
premium but all other French gold is wholly
uncurrent.</p>

<p>This port is a coaling station for English
    
<pb n="20170616_100737"/>
    
English steamers cruising about the vicinity,
on their passage to other stations down the coast,
and quite a large amount of tonnage is engaged 
in bringing the coals, the vessels generally
procuring freights of African timber from the 
adjacent rivers as return cargoes. The slavers
taken as prizes by English cruisers are sent here 
for condemnation, the following, is a list of
those condemned during the latter part of
last year and for the present year up to date.</p>

<p>1st Septr 29th 1859, a brig name unknown, arrived 
with 469 slaves on board, she was captured
off Vhydah by H.M.S.S. "Spitfire" commander
Chapman; condemned by the Vice Admiralty
court; about 300 of the slaves were shipped on
board the bark "Many Ann" Horton Master,
emigrant ship bound for Trinidad, she
sailed from this port June 19th 1860. It is
reported that many of the slaves left against
their will, and that a number of them
when let out of the yard in which they had 
been kept, to go on board the vessel, escaped 
to the bush, but were recaptured, the unwillingness 
to leave is accounted for in this
way, the slaves found many countrymen

<pb n="20170616_100743"/>
    
countrymen among the people of Sierra Leone who
persuaded them they ought to remain, and not
allow themselves to be sent away. It seem the
better plan to send them away however, as in 
nine cases out of ten they turn out very bad
if allowed to remain in the colony.</p>
    
<p>2nd "Brig El Rosario" captured by H.M.S.S.
"Arrogant" commander Edmonston, rear the line,
arrived here the 24th December 1859, condemned in
the Vice Admiralty court January 4th 1860.</p>

<p>3d A full ship of about 400 tons captured
by H.M.S.S. "Triton" Lieutenant Burton commanding, 
in Lat 3° 25' N. Long 11° W arrived here
April 17th 1860, the ship was without papers, colors
or names, condemned in the Vice Admiralty court.</p>

<p>4th Bark "Constancia" under Uriguayan colors
(formerly the American bark "Flying Cloud") captured
by H.M.S.S. "Electo" off Cameroons, arrival here
October 3rd 1860 condemned in the mixed commissions 
court October 29th 1860 as a prize to 
England and the Uriguayan Republic.</p>
    
<p>5th A brig no colors, or name Spanish built
captured by H.M.S.S. "Espoir" commander Douglas
off Seabar, Sherbro, arrival Nov. 21st 1860, condemned
in the Vice Admiralty court, this is the last    
    
<pb n="20170616_100748"/>
 
last vessel up to this date (December 20th 1860).</p>
    
<p>A canoe was captured by Thomas Pike 
Esqu harbor master, off Tagreen point Sierra
Leone river on the night of February 21st 1860,
she had on board 34 slaves they were all 
liberated.</p>
    
<p>Of late, Bulamo, in the Rio Grande river
has occupied the attention of this government,
it is considered a dependency of this colony,
it has been visited lately by Governor Hill,
and he will attempt another settlement, a 
company of soldiers are to the stationed there
at once. The Portuguese also claim the island
and occupied it until driven out by the 
English the claim I believe has never been
properly settled. In the spring and summer 
of 1859 an epidemic visited the colony, 
causing about, eighty deaths out of a population
of one hundred Europeans, the place is 
but just recovering from the effects of it.</p>
