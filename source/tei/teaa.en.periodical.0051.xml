<div2 type="article">

<p>Work in the Foreign Mission Field
has its peculiar and inevitable problems. 
In the case of our work in
Africa the natural problems have been
multiplied and accentuated chiefly by
lack of adequate episcopal supervision.
But among the noteworthy acts of the
recent General Conference a significant
step was taken which presages a 
new day for our African work&#8212;namely:
the assignment of a Bishop to that
field. The assignee is Bishop C. C.
Alleyne, and it is readily conceded that
no better choice could have been made.
Born a British subject, trained largely
in schools in British colonies, possessing 
fine culture, wide experience, broad
sympathies, and an ardent faith in the 
missionary spirit, ideal and programme
of Christianity; a lover of Africa and
things African, the Bishop comes to
his task with peculiar fitness. And,
faith, he will need every resource he
can command to cope in any adequate
manner with the complexities and difficulties 
of a much aggravated situation. 
He will need the fullest measure
of support and co-operation from the
Foreign Mission Board and the Woman's 
Home and Foreign Missionary
Society. There ought to be complete
rapport between him and them. He will
need the united and unceasing prayers
of the whole Church. He will need
money. And with an eye to this necessity, 
the Foreign Mission Board and
the Woman's Home and Foreign Missionary 
Society, with the sanction of
the General Conference, have united in
a drive to raise $25,000 for the immediate 
needs of our Foreign work&#8212;
$1,000 for each of the twenty-five years
since Bishop Small founded the mission
at Quittah. The entire Church should
get behind this Drive and put it over
in fine shape. The Bishop for Africa
will need workers. Africa presents a
peculiar and persistent challenge to
our group and ought to appeal to the
heroic in the educated young people
among us. It is the appeal of those who
have not to those who have. It is the
appeal of the benighted to the enlightened. 
It is the appeal of a great need.
It is said that the population of Africa
is about 130,000,000, and that there is
only one missionary for every 133,000
souls. We have been trying to do our
bit, but in the face of the overwhelming, 
challenging need of this great continent 
which embraces nearly one-fourth 
of all the land in the world, and
one-eighth of the entire population of
the globe, it seems so pitifully small.
But, God helping us, we are going to
do more. Africa calls! And Zion
echoes that call to her hosts. Who will
come up to the help of the Lord and 
Zion, crying: "Here am I: send me?"</p>

<p>"If you could sand in Africa tonight<lb/>
And see the moonlight on those
green-clad hills:<lb/>
If you could hear the youth's wild,
minor trills<lb/>
Dancing their life out, in that calm
moonlight;<lb/>




If you could know the pity of their
plight<lb/>
Without God, in a world of deadening ills,&#8212;<lb/>
Then you would know the deep despair
that fills<lb/>
The heart of sin-sick Africa tonight.</p>

<p>"And God says, 'Go' to all who name
the Name,<lb/>
And out of darkness reach those
hands for light.<lb/>
Upon us be the burden of the shame<lb/>
That Christ reigns not in Africa tonight!"</p>
