<p>US Consulate, Goree-Dakar<lb/>
March 30th 1886</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
James D Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>In reply to your request
relating to "Returns of unofficial
fees" I have to explain that none
whatever have been received at
this Consulate since it was
established, and I have not
had impressed on my mind
that I ought to have mentioned
the fact in some of my Dispatches.
Begging your pardon for the 
oversight I shall try and bear
in mind that such negative
reports are needed in the future.</p>
    
<p>In this connection it 
may not be wrong to mention 
that this Consulate cannot
be kept and all the regulations
    
<pb n="20170619_135919"/>

of the Government complied
with beyond criticism on the 
meagre salary afforded by "Fees"
without pecuniary loss to the 
incumbent. It is undoubtedly
an honor to represent the United
States abroad, but if I <unclear>divine</unclear>
right Consulates in newly-developed 
countries where
our commerce ought to be
expanded do not exist
solely for the sake of honoring
people, and every hardy <unclear extent="one word"/>
is not a "Didius Julianus"
that he can afford to buy
such an expansive luxury.
Pardon me for suggesting that
I believe the whole Fee system
is one calculated to weaken
the moral sense of both Shipmasters
and Consular Officers. <unclear extent="one word"/>
of masters would approve of anything
to gain the connivance of 
a Consular Officer on some 
paint they wished to carry
    
<pb n="20170619_135927"/>  
    
and have fees for pretended
services multiplied almost 
<sic>indefinately</sic> to increase his
demand against the Government.
Seven hundred dollars without 
fees, and a right to do business,
is as small a sum as would
support a Consulate here even 
respectably, and I hope some 
action will speedily be taken
to put it on such a basis.
By employing a clerk for 
other business enough time
might them be given the
consulate to have mistakes
in conducting its business
more generally avoided
and reports could then be 
got up which might 
be of great value to our 
citizens. Senegal in a new 
country with abundant 
capabilities for supporting 
a very large commerce.
Goree-Dakar with its
    
<pb n="20170619_135932"/>

excellent commercial
telegraphic and mail facilities 
is the commercial centre
and will probably soon
be the Capital; out of
about ten thousand tons of 
Shipping now in the harbor
only <unclear>five</unclear> hundred are American,
and that is much greater
than the average proportion;
Under such circumstances can 
it be wise for the United 
States to attempt keeping
a competent Officer here
whose salary is insufficient 
to allow him to keep well-posted 
on the clerical part 
of his duties?</p>

<p>I am esteemed sir<lb/> 
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
US Consul</p>
