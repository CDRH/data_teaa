<p>Of the letter from Dr B. F. Wilson of Johanna</p>

<p>Patsy Estates Johanna 29 May 1888.</p>

<p>A. E. B. Govea Esqr Actg U.S. Consul</p>

<p>Dear Sir, Your most acceptable letter of the
13th inst: duly received, and for which
please accept my thanks. I had began
to be astonished and ashamed that
Our Government had not taken notice
of any claims here. I have frequently
heard remarks <sic>comming</sic> from the French
Resident here and others that my
Government have abandoned me and
my case otherwise they would have pressed
it long before this. They all know well
the justice of my claims but will try the
claim of bluff if they can. There are all
sorts of schemes afloat to try and be rid
of me and my case. I have very good
reason to believe and am offered witness 
to prove that the Sultan here
made a written contract with the
French Resident here to send me out
of the Island and he agreed to do it!!
What can one expect from the French
or the Sultan after that unless they are
obliged by pressure to pay my indemnity.
<catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb n="140419"/>

The Sultan is now trying another
<sic>schem</sic> to deprive me of free labour
again yesterday all of my free labourers 
came to me saying they could
not work longer because the Sultan had
levied a poll tax of five and one half
dollars each to all that worked <sic>fo</sic> me
but those not working for me had
only to pay one dollar and one half!!
This is only <unclear extent="two or three words"/> to drive my
labour away. I have informed the
men that I would write the Governor
of Mayotte who is <sic>chif</sic> of the Protectorate 
and they had better work and wait
his reply. The most of them went to
work this morning. How far the Governor 
will interfere remain to be seen.
He is a nice old man but does not I
think wish to out against the Sultan
I hope you will keep me informed
of the progress of my case at home and
inform the U.S. Government of this
affair between the Sultan and French
Resident to get rid of me. Hoping to hear from
you by the return mail. I am your obedient Servant</p>

<p>Signed B. F. Wilson</p>
