<p>Accounts and returns.</p>

<p>No 10.</p>

<p>Consulate Gen'l of the United States<lb/>
Monrovia Liberia Sept 30th 1887</p>

<p>Honorable James. D. Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose the accounts
and returns of this office for the quarter just
ended as per the subjoined link of enclosures.
The arrival and departure of American vessels,
for the quarter is not reported owing to the
fact, that only one American vessel–the Monrovia
has arrived here, during the quarter,
and as said vessel is still on the Liberian
Coast, the report of arrivals and departures
of American vessels will include two
quarters, the 3rd and 4th and be stated
Dec 31st 1887. Enclosures (1) one and (4) four,
will be easily understood by what is said
in reference to arrival of American vessels.
In explanation of enclosure No (3) Mr Sharp the
proprietor of the house, used for the legation
informs me that heretofore instead of being paid
<catchwords>in</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1208.jpg"/>

in absence his rent (as I supposed) he has
been paid at the end of the quarter. Therefore
instead of rent voucher (1) one being approved
for rent during the 3rd quarter it must be,
taken for rent during the second quarter.
The "draft" drawn in Mr Sharp's favor charging
$87.50 to the 3rd quarter ending Sept. 30th and dated
July 1st 1887, must read "Chargeable to the Second
quarter ending June 30th Mr Sevier, kept
no intelligent record of his business transactions
in the office. I have drawn for Mr
Jesse Sharp, a "draft" for $87.50 chargeable
to this quarter for rent from July 1st to and
including Sept 30th 1887. Said "draft," is dated
Sept 30th 1887. and carries number, (16) sixteen.
Hence you will have two "drafts" chargeable,
to the same quarter, for the same thing with
like vouchers, the difference only being in
their dates and number. The only work
necessary is to charge to the 2nd quarter, one
of said "drafts" instead of both to their quarter.
I have the honor to state, that I shall leave
Monrovia for America, by the next vessel or steamer
leaving this port. Capt. Beverly Y. Payne,
a young Liberian, 28 y'rs of age, a citizen
<catchwords>of the</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1209.jpg"/>

of the Republic of Liberia, will be left in charge
of the Consulate General, during my absence.
In my opinion he is the most safe man I could
appoint. He will be in the quality of Acting
Vice Consul Gen'l. His compensation will
be at the rate of $300.00 for annum, and
this will be in full payment for all services
rendered by him, in obedience to instruction
from the Department at Washington or myself.
Mr Payne's contract is on file in the State
Department, accompanying my Dip. Series No.
23 (quod vide) I did not require Bond of Mr Payne,
for (2) two reasons. First, because I am
sure that nothing be recovered in a
suit on a Bond in Liberia. Second, because
I have the utmost confidence in this
young man's integrity and believe a Bond
to be entirely unnecessary. Mr Payne
will draw no drafts <sic>on the</sic> against the
United States treasury, or presume
to express sentiments, or opinions of
the Government, before first, having received
instructions from the Department
of State so to do. Believing that in every
particular I have tired to subserve the
<catchwords>interest</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll5-1210.jpg"/>

interest of the Government which I
have the honor to serve, I beg you, to
allow me the great privilege of subscribing
myself to be,<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant<lb/>
