<p>United States Commercial Agency at<lb/>
Loanda 30th September 1862</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Herewith I have the honor to
forward to the Department of State in
conformity to Sections 153 and 154 of
the General Instructions to Consular Officers
the Annual General Report for the Years
1861 and 1862.</p>

<p>Commerce</p>

<p>The Greater part of the commerce of this
place is with Portugal, Untied States,
and the Brazils.</p>

<p>Imports from Portugal consisting
principally in Wines <unclear>Liver &#38;</unclear> Oil, and 
English Manufactured Goods $250000:00</p>

<p>Exports, Palm, Fish, and Ground <unclear>nut</unclear>
Oil, Wax, Hides, Ivory, Copal, and Coffee. $400,000:00</p>

<p>United States Imports, Rum Provisions
<catchwords>Lumber</catchwords>

<fw type="address">To the Honble
W. H. Seward<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</fw>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0040.002"/>

Lumber, Powder, and Cotton manufactured
Goods, the importation of the latter Article
having entirely fallen off these last eighteen
months; owing to the Civil War in America
causing the great advance in the price
of Cotton. $150.000.00</p>

<p>Exports. Palm and Fish Oil, Coffee, Copal,
Ivory and Ground Nuts. $250,000:00</p>

<p>Brazils, Imports, Rum, Sugar, &#38; Tobacco. $100,000:00</p>

<p>Exports, Palm and Ground Nut Oil, Wax
and Hides. $20,000:00</p>

<p>Great Britain. The principal Article
imported has been Coals abouts 5000 tons
freighted in American bottoms at the
low rate of 25 and <unclear>28/0</unclear> per Ton, Valuation
including freight laid down here is $55000.00</p>

<p>The great draw back 
to the Commerce of this place is the
exorbitant high duties, which is levied 
on all merchandise imported more 
particularly on American which 
according to Treaty has to pay two thirds 
(2/3) and national vessels on third (1/3) on 
an average I may safely estimate it at
35 pr cent ad valorem on all merchandise
<catchwords>imported</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0040.003"/>

imported from the United States</p> 

<p>The Currency of this Province of Angola
was formerly Fourteen hundred reis to the 
American or Spanish Dollar, but in July 1861 
on the arrival of the new Governor the Currency 
was changed to the same rate as Lisbon which
is nine hundred &#38; twenty reis to the American or 
Spanish Dollar, one mil reis equal to one 
Dollar nine Quarter Cents ($1. 9 1/4)</p>

<p>The Sanitary condition of this place for
the past eighteen months has been rather
unfavorable, the yellow fever and black 
vomit having made its appearance for the
first time supposed to have been brought
from the Brazils, cases which has terminated 
fatally has been principally new comers.</p>

<p>Before closing this I cannot let pass 
without commenting on the late affair which 
occurred in April 1861 the Imprisonment 
of the U.S. Naval Store Keeper Mr E A Bernie
for a trivial offence and the brutal treatment 
he received at the hands of the Authorities 
of this place</p>

<p>To think an official in the Employ of the
U.S. Government in a foreign Port should be

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0040.004"/>

shut up in a filthy prison for Seventy
days is shameful and contrary to 
the Treaty with Portugal ratified in 
1840 art: 10 wherein it says (and it is 
hereby declared that in case of offence 
against the laws such Consul, Vice
Consul, Agent, or Commissary may 
either be punished according to law, 
or be sent back the offended Government 
assigning to the other reasons for the Same.</p>

<p>The American Squadron was on 
the Coast at the time of this occurrence 
Flag Officer Innman demanded the
said E A Bernie but was refused
consequently E. A. Bernie was left to
his fate and the result of the trial was 
deportation for 2 years. I hope after 
the termination of the rebellion in
America the U.S. Government will
demand satisfaction from Portugal 
for so gross an insult</p>

<p>Very respectfully<lb/>
Your Obdt Servant<lb/>
Robert Cunningham<lb/>
