<p>Consulate of the United States of America<lb/>

Washington D.C.</p>

<p>The need of a change in the Vice Consulate</p>

<p>Encloses</p>

<p>Reasons for asking the same and
proposing Francisco Martins Swart.</p>

<pb n="Scan20032"/>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
at St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
July 14th 1883.</p>

<p>To<lb/>
Hon. John Davis<lb/>
Asst. Secty of State<lb/> 
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>After a very careful study and close observation
of the United Vice Consul Robert S. Newton since
his return from England as reported in my despatch
No 34, I am compelled to state that I came to
the conclusion that a change ought to be made
in the United Vice Consular appointment of
this City, for the benefit of the United States 
Government, its citizens and commence.</p>

<p>I believe in fair dealings, but above
all in the appointment of peoples who
are attached to, and respect the United 
States of America, and who try to do 
their utmost to promote its commerce,
interest, and general success.</p>

<p>Messrs Robert S. Newton and J. Carnegie
came here almost 14 years ago as clerks
of the late United States Commercial agent

<pb n="Scan20033"/>

A.A. Silva of Boston Mass, and one of the richest
merchants of Angola.</p>

<p>A few years ago Mr Silva left for his home, Chelsea
Mass, but unfortunately died at sea from 
causes unknown.</p>

<p>Since Mr Silva death these two young men
clerks took the whole business of late Mr Silva
and have paid his brother Frederick A Silva of
Charlestown Mass. the amount received from
the United States Government for services
as U.S. Vice Commercial Agent, and lately
promoted by Mr Jackson the U.S. Consul
who resigned his post after "one month
residence," as U.S. Vice Consul.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert S. Newton today is H. B.
Majesty paid Vice Consul in this city, and
being concerned with English gilding, embroidery
&amp;a &amp;a cares no longer for the interests
of the Untied States &amp;a &amp;a &amp;a</p>

<p>I will not enter into particulars
concerning the gentleman, although
I can charge him of disobedience to orders
&amp; others, but I will say that it is my
opinion and that without entertaining
any prejudice or bad feelings toward him 
whatsoever.

<pb n="Scan20034"/>

Beside the right of his removal by my despatch
No 3 from State Depart. dated March 15th
1882 and signed J. C. Bancroft Davis
Asst. Secty. of State.</p>

<p>I must repeat that for the benefit of American
interests, "if such can be hoped for here," after
all the private letters I wrote to my old ship,
owners, merchants &amp;a with whom I am 
acquainted in Massachusetts, New York,
Maryland, Florida, North and South Carolina
and Maine; and considering the contents
of Capt. Perry's letters, changing his plans
for supplying the Americans Whaling
ships at Loanda &amp;a &amp;a That I call
the attention of the State Department
for an immediate change.</p>

<p>An United States Consul <unclear>came at</unclear> also
be her B. Majesty's Consul neither can
H. B. Majesty's Consul be a true United 
States Consul in this part of the Coast.</p>

<p>I would respectfully suggest that 
Mr Francises Martens Swart a well
educated gentleman, and a rising young
merchant of Loanda speaking several 
languages, he very lately ordered from the

<pb n="Scan20035"/>

United States, the full cargo of Lumber &amp;a &amp;a who 
was brought here by the Am: Bark Horace
Scudder under <unclear>company</unclear> and the name of Newton Carnegie &amp; Co
I believe that this change will benefit
the American commerce &amp;a &amp;a</p>

<p>I will also report that during my short
absence north, an Am: Whaling bark was
lost south of Mossamedes The Capt, officers
and crew came to Loanda, and were sent
to Lisbon, by Portuguese mail steamer Portugal
on my return on board the U.S.S. Quinnebang
Capt A. Ludlow, I asked Mr. Newton
about the copy of affidavits &amp;a &amp;a concerning
the loss of that vessel and the amount 
he had paid for the ship wrecked crew
his answer was, that he had sent <unclear extent="one word"/>
Home; and had no copies. I will
mention that in that case, one half of 
the crew were shipped in St. Helana
about 2 month previous of her last. and
instead of sending these men back to 
St Helena by one of the Vessels he had
chartered to carry cattles for the British
govt. as "Ascention" he forwarded them 
to Lisbon at a great expense.</p>

<pb n="Scan20036"/>

<p>In fact Mr. Newton do not wish to have
any superior officer here and Mr. Jackson 
the late U.S. Consul here, went home and
resigned his consulate by Mr. Newton paying
him the full amount of his expenses from
home to Loanda and from Loanda to the 
United States.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Ls de R du Verge<lb/>
US Consul</p>
