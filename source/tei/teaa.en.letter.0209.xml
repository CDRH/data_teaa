<p>Department of State.</p>

<p>Monrovia June 8th 1888.<lb/>
Liberia W.C.A.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>In response to a request emanating
from your Legation I have the honor
to communicate for the information
of your Government, the following
particulars relative to the present
outbreak or rebellious attitude assumed 
by certain of the aboriginal
tribes of the south eastern portion of
the Republic, towards my Government 
and which in its opinion constitutes
an emergency or a sufficient reason
for a solicitation of the immediate
assistance of the Government of the 
United States by means of its naval
forces and otherwise.</p>

<p>About the middle of last year 
the major portion of the inhabitants 
of Half Cavalla, a district about 12
miles South of Cape Palmas, began 
to exhibit systems of restlessness 
and a disposition to obstruct the
execution of, and to disobey the <catchwords>Revenue</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon Chas H. J. Taylor<lb/>
U.S. Minister Resident<lb/>
and Consul General<lb/>
U.S. Legation<lb/>
Monrovia.</fw>

<pb n="20170616_145834"/>

Revenue Laws of the Republic. Efforts
<unclear extent="one word"/> immediately set on foot by the 
authorities of the County of Maryland 
to allay their manifestations in a 
peaceful manner, by <unclear>convening</unclear> a 
council of the adjacent tribes in compact 
with the Government and before 
whom the conduct of the Half Cavalla Tribe
was brought for consideration. The 
council unanimously condemned the 
course taken by the Half Cavalla Tribe 
as being improper and disloyal, <unclear extent="one word"/>
them in a small fine, which
after considerable demurring on the 
part of the offenders, was agreed to 
be paid and matters seemed quiet 
for the present. Towards the close 
of the year however, this tribe <unclear extent="one word"/> 
thereto by the intrigues of one Julio, a 
foreigner and illicit trader, residing 
at <unclear>Saboo</unclear>, and another British trader
setting at defiance our Revenue Laws
at Half Cavalla itself, assumed an 
attitude of open defiance, and 
insubordination toward the Government,
and in spite of repeated efforts on 
the part of the Authorities to induce
them to peacefully recede from their 
rebellious attitudes, and return to their 
allegiance, have steadfastly refused 
to permit the execution of the laws 
within their district, have organized 
themselves into an armed force <catchwords>fortified</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_145840"/>

fortified their villages; and have openly 
declared their intentions to resist by 
force of arms any attempt of the 
Government to destroy peace and
order in their districts. They have
also appealed to the British Government 
through the Governors of its Colonies 
adjacent to the Republic of Liberia 
to be taken under its protectorate, 
and are now actively endeavoring to 
stir up and enlist more powerful 
tribes as their auxillaries in this
outbreak, so as to assume the 
offensive against the Government 
as soon as possible, and have lately 
expelled from their midst christianzed 
and civilized natives to the number 
of 80 more or less, whose only offense 
was, a decided refusal to fight 
against the Government to whom
they had sworn allegiance.</p>

<p>It is but fair however to state 
that the British Naval authorities 
on the West Coast have so far
declined affording any aid to these
insurgents, and their sympathies have
hitherto been exerted on our behalf, 
but the fact that they do not count
us prime factors in this matter,
will I trust be made sufficiently 
clear in the succeeding paragraph
of this Despatch.</p>

<p>The effect of these occurrences <catchwords>has</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_145847"/>

has been to paralyze lawful commerce
in that portion of the Republic, and
to gravely embarrass our government. 
It is obvious that if this state of affairs 
at Half Cavalla, should continue 
unchecked, <del>that</del> a powerful combination 
will soon be formed against the 
Government, incited and openly aided 
and abetted by the foreign traders 
aforesaid and secretly encouraged by 
certain Foreign Governments, 
signatories of the Berlin Conference, who 
for some time past have been intriguing 
to obtain possession of this 
position of our Territory, if not indeed
of the entire territory of the Republic. 
See Enclosures B.C.D</p>

<p>With reference to the points raised 
in Enclosure C. the undersigned would
remark as follows; </p>

<p>1. That Liberia does not contemplate
or project an extension of Frontier, the 
territories between the Grand Cesters and 
San Pedro Rivers having been an 
integral part of our territory since 
the year 1857, (before that period it 
was comprised in the State of 
Maryland in Liberia 1834-6, 1846-1850)
and recognised as such by the European 
Powers until the era of the 
"scramble for Africa".</p>

<p>2. Liberia is neither a European 
Power nor a signatory of the decisions <catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_145853"/>

of the Berlin Conference, she was
not invited to assist in those deliberations, 
and is therefore not 
bound by its decisions, and further
those decisions refer to future acquisitions 
of African Territory by 
European Powers, and not to the 
present possessions or future acquisitions 
of an African State.</p>

<p>My Government declines on these 
grounds to commit suicide, as it 
would do by adopting the course suggested 
by the British of Foreign Office in
Enclosure C. or even for the present to enter 
into such correspondence with 
Great Britain as may occasion the
opening a South eastern Boundary question
which seems to be desired by the 
gentlemen of the Foreign Office hinder
the pressing circumstances my Government 
feels itself compelled to solicit
the interference of that of the United
States in this matter between itself
and its aboriginal citizens, in the
following measures, in which it is 
to be hoped Mr. Minister Your Government 
will see its way clear the concur viz:</p>

<p><catchwords>Naval</catchwords>

<pb n="20170616_145858"/>

Naval co-operation with the Liberian
forces for the subsiding of this outbreak,
against the authority of the Republic.</p>

<p>Assisting in establishing and
protecting one or more settlements
in the Southeastern portion of the
Republic one of them being planted 
on the San Pedro River as the Port
of Entry, which would confront 
foreign intrigant with accomplished 
facts.</p>

<p>The keeping up of regular  
communication between the proposed settlements
and the centre of Government,
and the enforcement of our Revenue 
Laws along our Coast. For these 
purposes the gunboat recommended
by His Excellency President Cleveland 
in his last message to the U.S. Congress 
to be presented to the Republic of 
Liberia, and regular visits of a U.S. 
Ship would be invaluable.</p>

<p>Soliciting Mr Minister the exertion 
of your good offices with your 
Government in regard to its favorable
action on the particulars herein 
brought to your notice. I have the 
honor to be with sentiments of 
the highest consideration and 
esteem</p>

<p>Your obedient Servant</p>
