<note>No 26</note>

<p>United States Commercial Agency<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda Oct. 15th, 1866.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the 
Department that since my Despatch 
No 25 the board ordered by 
the Navy department composed 
of three officers of the U.S. Store 
Ship "Purveyor" has established 
at this city a Naval Store house  
for the use of the U.S. Vessels of 
War.</p>

<p>On their arrival here they 
applied officially to me for 
assist-
<catchwords>ance</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon William H Seward<lb/> 
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</fw>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0074.002"/>

-ance which was cheerfully offered 
them, with, I am pleased to say 
favorable results.</p>

<p>Being familiar with 
the inconvenience which the former 
United States Store Keeper had to 
contend with, I lost no time to 
request His Excellency to allow me 
the privilege to suggest a plan 
more simple than the former and equally
as secure to the Portuguese Government. 
His Excellency requested 
an interview with me for explanation, 
which resulted in his acquiescence 
to all my views.</p>

<p>I suggested the privilege 
to allow the United States Naval 
Store Keeper on the arrival of every

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0074.003"/>

Store Ship to deposit at the Custom 
house a duplicate copy of her cargo, 
and to permit without Custom house 
vigilance the Ship to discharge said 
cargo with the Store house.</p>

<p>The duplicate Invoice 
would answer as a correct voucher for 
all stores that entered the Store house 
and as voucher for delivery, each vessel 
of war should furnish the Store Keeper
a duplicate receipt for what they receive, 
one of which to be deposited at 
the Custom house. The Custom house 
authorities to have the privilege, whenever
they should deem it necessary to 
verify the balance of Stores on hand.</p>

<p>The immediate willingness 
of His Excellency to concede to our 
<catchwords>request</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0074.004"/>

request and practically carrying it out, 
speaks of itself the high esteem that 
distinguished official entertains toward the 
American character.</p>

<p><sic>Leuit.</sic> Commander Devens 
of the U.S. Store Ship "Purveyor" left 
this port highly impressed with the 
kind attention he received from His Excellency, 
and before his departure, in a letter expressed 
his thanks to him, in very appropriate 
words, which was enclosed 
by me to him in another note joining 
Capt Devens in his sentiments</p>

<p>The advantages gained
by the present concession over that <sic>concedede</sic> 
to the former store house established 
here by Flag officer Inman in 1859 
<catchwords>can</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0074.005"/>

can only be appreciated by those familiar 
with the vexation the former Store 
Keeper had to undergo, being as he always 
was dependant in the slow motion 
of a native Custom house guard, who 
held a second key to all the Store houses,
and even so the Store house could only 
be opened in the Custom house hours.</p>

<p>His Excellency has 
always manipulated his friendliness towards 
the United States by special 
cordiality to United States Naval 
Officers when they visit him, and during 
the visit of the U.S. Ship "<unclear>Funeata</unclear>" 
at this port, he visited that ship 
which was quite unexpected as I 
never knew a Governor General to visit 
<catchwords>any</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0074.006"/>

any grade below a Commodore.</p>

<p>His Excellency has 
been promoted to a rear admiral 
since he assumed charge of this 
government.</p>

<p>I have the honor<lb/>
to be<lb/>
Your Most Obt Servt<lb/>
Augustus Archer Silva<lb/>
Commercial Agent</p>
