<p>Honorable Josiah Quincy<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the Department 
of my arrival at this place. February 26th
from Stanley Falls.</p>
    
<p>From Novr 29th, the date of my last
letter to the Department, I have traveled
through most of the Mallela country
lying between the Lomami &amp; the Loualaba, 
&amp; have been down the Loualaba
to Stanley Falls &amp; Basoko, returning to
Kassongo by the same road.</p>
    
<p>The Arab was being about <unclear extent="three words"/> 
having been defeated and 
driven from the country, I shall have 
in a few days for the month of 
the Lukugu, 10 days south of here
and follow the course of that
river to the Tanganyika. This will
<catchwords>occupy</catchwords>
    
<pb n="20170614_145213"/>

occupy
at least five months. On arrival 
at Mpala, I shall go to the North
end of the Lake, &amp; from there to 
the South and take the <unclear extent="one word"/>
road to Nyassa, down the Lake 
to the Shire &amp; on to Quelimene 
on the East Coast. I hope to
be on the Coast about September 
1st &amp; if the Department permits
will take steamer from there to 
the Cape of Good Hope &amp; on to 
Boma to settle my affairs &amp; return
to America on leave.</p>
    
<p>I have a force of sixty soldiers
with me armed with the Albini
rifle &amp; some hundred porters. I suppose 
the total number of people in 
my caravan may be put down at
250.</p>
    
<p>I am in the best of the health.
I have had no letters or papers for
ten months!</p>

<p>Respectfully<lb/>
R. Dorsey Mohun<lb/>
U. S. Commercial Agent</p>

<pb n="20170614_145223"/>

<p>Memorandum.</p>

<p>The Consul at Boma, Kongo Free State, reported
under date of February 28 that he was at that time at
Kassongo, on the Upper Kongo, and that he intended to
proceed from there to Mpala, Lake Tanganyika, thence
to the north end of the lake, thence south to the southern
extremity of the lake, thence across the country to the
northern extremity of Lake Nyassa, thence by the Shire 
river to the coast at Quilimane. He expects to reach 
Quilimane about the first of next September. We have
a Consular Agent at Beira just south of Quilimane, and
I suggest that we write to Mr. Mohun in care of the
Consular Agent at Beira with instructions (to the agent) to send the
letter to Quilimane. In this letter I think we shoud
direct Mr. Mohun to return by water to Boma and settle
his accounts; also that we should grant him sixty days
leave of absence to come to the United States. He has
been in the interior of Africa ever since his arrival
in Boma about two years ago. He states that he has not
received any communication whatever in ten months.</p>
