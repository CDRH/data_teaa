DR. STRAIGHT
After listening to great attempts at beautiful strains of melodious music and a pyrotechnical display of humorous humorosities, quintessence of brevity rather than prolix verbosity, will best accomplish the purpose for which I appear here this evening. Now that I've made everything so plain that even a child can understand, I'll proceed with business. I hold here in my hand a preparation made from roots, herbs, barks, leaf grasses, cereals, vegetables, fruits and chemicals warranted, by myself, to do all that I claim, even more. I'm not here to sell this article but simply to advertise the greatest boon that mankind has ever known. I will forfeit one thousand dollars to ― hold up the money so that they can see it
(attendants hold up a large sack marked $1000)
― or I will take the same amount from any dark skin son or daughter of the genius 1 Africanus that I cannot immediately transform into an Apollo or Cleopatra with a hirsute appendage worthy of a Greek goddess.
VOICE
( interrupting)
Look here, Mr. Medicine man, if you 'specs to sell any of dem bottles of whatever you've got there to anybody in this crowd, you'd better bring your language down to the limitations of a universal understanding. I've been standin' here ten minutes tryin' to figger out what you're talkin' about and I tell you as the old maxim says, "Patience ceases to be virtuous."
DR. STRAIGHT
Your patience shall be rewarded. I'll come to the point at once. This compound known as Straightaline is the greatest hair tonic on earth. What will Straightaline do? Why it cures dandruff, tetter itch, and all scalp diseases at once and forever. It makes hair grow on bald-headed babies. It makes curly hair as straight as a stick in from one to ten days. Straightaline straightens kinky hair in from ten to thirty days and most wonderful of all, Straightaline straightens knappy or knotty hair.
( he hesitates) VOICE
Well?
DR. STRAIGHT In three days. VOICE
I'll take a bottle of dat.
DR. STRAIGHT
Wait, wait, wait, this is not all. I have another preparation, Oblicuticus, "Obli" ― in this case, being an about:srcdoc Page 2 of 44

In Dahomey 9/24/21, 12:22 PM
abbreviation of the word "obliterate." "Cuti" ― taken from the word "cuticle," the outer skin, and "cuss" is what everybody does when the desired results are not obtained, but there is no such word as "fail." This wonderful face bleach removes the outer skin and leaves in its place a peachlike complexion that can't be duplicated ― even by peaches. Changing black to white and vice versa. I am going to spend only one day in your city, but I am going to convince you by exhibiting a living evidence of my assertions that these two grand preparations, Straightaline and Oblicuticus are the most wonderful discovery of modern times.
( attendant stands up)
2 This young man is a martyr to science. Here you have the work of nature. Here the work of art. Here is the
kinky hair here.
( stage business with hair and skin color)
The long, silky straight hair, here the bronze of nature, here the peachlike complexion. Remember, I leave here tomorrow for Gatorville, Florida.
VOICES
Give me a bottle, give me a bottle. DR. STRAIGHT
Wait a minute ― I'm not here to sell, I'm only advertising these two grand articles, Straightaline and Oblicuticus, and after dispensing with a few coin of the realm, if you will accompany me to Skinners, I will place a few bottles of Straightaline and Oblicuticus at your disposal. Mind you, I'm not here to sell but to advertise. I'm not here to make money, but to give it away.
( he throws coins and exits. A quartet ― The Barbers Society of Philosophical Research ― enters and sings "Annie Laurie") 3
Maxwelton's braes are bonnie, Where early fa's the dew, And 'twas there that Annie Laurie gave me her promise true. Which ne'er forgot will be, and for bonnie Annie Laurie

MOSES

Hello. Mose, what are you kicking about?

MOSES
Ain't kickin' at all. Got both feet restin' right on the ground what they belong. I'se just naturally disgusted with the frivolities of the colored population of dis country.
STAMPFIELD
You shouldn't let trifles annoy you. I'll dare say you'll find the population of Dahomey quite as much a source of annoyance as the colored population of this country. Your exalted opinion of the ideal life to be found in a barbarous country is beyond my comprehension.
MOSES
It's all right for you, son, to argue that way, 'cause you 'specs to live and die amongst these white folks here in the United States, but the colonization society that leaves this country for Dahomey takes a different view of the matter. In the first place, we've 'vestigated the country and found out just what's what.
STAMPFIELD
In other words, the existing conditions. MOSES
( doubtfully)
Yes. Everything points to success. They tell me that gold and silver in Dahomey is plentiful, as the whiskey is on election day in Bosting [Boston]. The climate's fine ― just the right thing for raisin' chickens and watermelons. It never snows so you don't need no clothes
( pauses)
sich as the people wear here, and who know but what you can get a few franchises from the king to start
street cars, 'lectric lights and saloons to running. STAMPFIELD
You've fine, big ideas, but suppose the natives suddenly don't take kindly to the new order of things and refuse to be electric lighted, salooned and otherwise fixed up with blessings of civilization. Suppose they look upon you as intruders and instead of receiving you with open arms
( pause)
make war on you.
MOSES
( slowly)
If it comes to that, we'll arrange with dem gentlemen like Uncle Sam did with the Indians.

MOSES

(GEORGE REEDER, who runs the Intelligence Office, enters and crosses as if to enter the office.) STAMPFIELD
Hello, there Reeder. I've got a registered letter for you. I was just in the office, but didn't like to leave it. ( business of signing receipts, etc.)
REEDER
I suppose you and Mose were having one of your regulation arguments about Dahomey, eh? STAMPFIELD
Bye the bye, when does the Colonization Society leave for Dahomey? REEDER
They don't go direct from here to Dahomey. They leave here tomorrow for Gatorville, Florida, where they join the main body. I don't know when they start for Dahomey. I may go along myself. The fact of the matter is, they are in session in my office at this moment.
MOSES
(STAMP starts to exit but MOSE interrupts)
Just wait a minute, Stampfield. I forgot to give you this letter. It's for my brother. You know he's the fountain head of this whole scheme to go to Dahomey. It's the only thing we ever did agree on.
( voices inside as if quarreling)
That's the first argument I've missed since I've been a member of the Society.
( exit MOSE)
STAMPFIELD
Well, Reeder, if you do go to Dahomey, accept my best wishes for success. So long.

REEDER
Well, that's a jolly crowd.

MRS. STRINGER
Yes, they couldn't help but be jolly. They haven't got anything on their mind but their hair. REEDER
Mrs. Stringer.
( bows politely)
MRS. STRINGER
Has anyone asked for me during my absence?
REEDER
Only Mrs. Waite.
MRS. STRINGER
It's a wonder she wouldn't get tired of that.
REEDER
Of what?
MRS. STRINGER
Of calling when I'm out, and keeping me waiting for that little bill that's been standing nearly two months. She owes me for the biggest bargain that ever slipped through my fingers. I sold her a silk dress worth three dollars and twenty-five cents a yard that belonged to Mrs. Mountine for a beggarly twelve dollars, and she still owes me ten dollars and ninety-eight cents of that. A bargain debt. I don't see what service a dress that Mrs. Mountine could wear would be to a tiny little woman like Mrs. Waite.
REEDER
Why, Mrs. Mountine weights 250 pounds if she weighs an ounce and Mrs. Waite not more than 115 pounds or twenty pounds at the most.
MRS. STRINGER
Yes, but Mrs. Waite has three children ― all girls.

And there's enough goods in that dress to make them all dresses. Don't you know, Mrs. Reeder, I've got a notion to take advantage of the cheap rate that the Dahomian Colonization Society is getting from here to Gatorville, Florida. I've got a lot of dresses of good material but ancient as to style I might dispose of. You know they are still wearing

Send to my address at once two detectives Box 13, Gatorville, Florida. I lost last Friday, which was the thirteenth of the month, a silver casket with a cat drawed on the outside and a cat's eyes on the inside. A friend of mine give me your address and said you could furnish anything from a Chinese laundry to a bull pup, and that is why I write to you for a couple of detectives. Inclosed find second-class fare for detectives and two dollars extra if they find the cat's eye, as it is very valuable. P. S. Don't forget to send the detectives. Respectfully yours, Cicero Lightfoot, Box 13, Gatorville, Florida.

ain't mad are you, Sherry?
(burlesque pathos)
SHYLOCK
No, I ain't mad. I've been laughing every since we got off that boat we come up on from down south. Ha, ha, ha.
(sarcastically)
I'm laughing 'cause I worked all the winter and then got worked for every cent I made while I was on the boat coming up here. I'm laughing 'cause three days after I git in town after workin' all the winter, I've got to blow the bass drum in the Salvation Army to keep from starving to death.
RAREBACK
Well, it ain't my fault that you've got that drum. Neither is it my fault that you worked all the winter and haven't got anything now. I told you not to speculate with your money.
SHYLOCK
Spec-a-late! Spec-a-late! Den I didn't lose my money shootin' craps? I lost it speculatin'? RAREBACK
It won't do any good for you and I to squabble over what can't be helped. I'm in just as bad a fix as you are, and I believe all our bad luck came through the silver box I got hold of just about three hours before we struck the wharf.
SHYLOCK
I don't know nothin' about our bad luck, but I do know all about my bad luck, when the man came on board the boat with that rusty lookin' coat on and wanted to sell that silver box, I was the fust man that reached out my hand to get it, but jist as soon as I seen dat a cat was scratched on the back, I turned round three times, walked backwards four steps, throwed a hand full of salt over my left shoulder, and I give him back that box so quick, if I was superstitious, I'd a swore I seen that cat's whiskers move.
RAREBACK
Shy, did you see inside that box?
SHYLOCK
No sah, the outside was enough for me.
RAREBACK
There was a cat's eye in that box and it looked as if the eye was alive.

SHYLOCK
You know a cat's got nine lives anyhow, and if that cat's eye ain't been dead but once, it's got eight more chances. Look here, you ain't got that thing in your pocket now have you?
RAREBACK
No, I just left the fellow that I sold it to just before we got off the boat. Do you remember how many times that box changed hands before I got hold of it?
SHYLOCK
Yes, fust that man with the rusty yaller coat offered to sell it for a dollar and six bits, then I come purty near havin' it. Say, don't you know every time I think of how near I come to havin' that box, it gives me the shivers.
RAREBACK
Why? You ain't superstitious. SHYLOCK
Not excruciatingly, but then cats is bad luck, and that's all there is to it, but to get back to the subject, he finally sold the box for six bits and that bowlegged cook that bought it had that box just thirteen minutes when he got broke, and the man he sold it to had thirteen dollars, and after speculatin' with a crosseyed barber about four minutes, the thirteen dollars and the box changed hands again. Jist about that time I begun speculatin' myself, and I lost sight of it until I saw you with it jist before the boat landed. After the boat landed, it was a case of root hog or die til I struck a job blowin' the drum.
RAREBACK
You don't blow a drum, you beat a drum.
SHYLOCK
If you carried this drum far as I did, you'd know there's a lot of blowin' attached to this job. Yes, I'm blowing this drum.
RAREBACK
Well, we won't argue whether you beat or blow the drum. The financial question interests me more than anything else. You haven't got a cent. Neither have I. What are we going to do?
SHYLOCK
I'm goin' to keep my job in the Salvation Army. RAREBACK

SHYLOCK
If the job's as heavy as the language, excuse me.
RAREBACK
Go ahead, Mr. Reeder.
REEDER
I want a little private detective work done in connection with this letter I hold here in my hand. I'll explain. An old gentleman living in Gatorville, Florida, being a little superstitious
(business for RARE and SHY )
has lost an insignificant article to which he sets great store. He considers the article of inestimable value and has offered a reward of five hundred dollars for its return. Now, I've come to the conclusion that the old man in question has not lost the article, but being overcareful, he has hidden the aforesaid article from himself, as it were. So I think by careful search you would very likely find the article among some of his effects that he had overlooked; however, he imagines it has been stolen.
RAREBACK
I guess we could handle the case, eh, Sherry? SHYLOCK
Well, I hope so, John.

You don't want that drum now. You don't know when you're in good luck. The silver box he's talking about is the one I sold the fellow that I just left down in Graball's saloon. We'll go down there, bring him up here. You go in and borrow three dollars from Reeder, buy the box, but we won't tell Reeder we've got it. Then we'll go down to Gatorville, Florida, for a bluff, live a week in clover, then give the old man the box and get the five hundred, eh?

Get the money first. The way you tell that sounds so natural. I could feel myself separatin' that old man from that five hundred . . if it wasn't for that cat.
RAREBACK
Instead of being bad luck, a cat turns out to be the best friend we ever had. After this you ought to hug and kiss every cat you run across.
SHYLOCK
I've got to admit if it wasn't for that cat's picture, you couldn't tell that box from no other silver box; therefore, I'm bound to respect cats but no fust-class detective ain't goin' round huggin' and kissin' cats, no matter how much he respects them.

They ain't satisfied to see their noodles ain't swelled on account of their dough, but they figure this country's a dead one. Some bloke tipped off Dahomey as the original Klondike and they're goin' against the brace, hook, line, and sinker. I'm goin' to steer the gang down to Gatorville where the main Gazaboo of the whole push hangs out. Say, fellows, I get two dollars a head from the captain of the dugout that snatches 'em away from this burg, and I've got a contract with a medicine shark, in all cases of sea sickness, we split the purse fifty-fifty.

HUSTLING CHARLEY
No chance to be mistaken.
SHYLOCK
When he went up the gang plank, did he have this box with the cat scratched on the back ― in his hand? HUSTLING CHARLEY
Say, since I come to think of it, he had a big satchel in one hand, he was fishin' around in his pockets with the other hand, and the box in his mouth. Say, I'm goin' inside. I'll see you when I come out.

Well, Sherry, we'll have to keep up our bluff anyway, so we'll go down to Gatorville, Florida, make old man Lightfoot think we are looking for the box he lost, and if we're lucky, we may get a chance to go to Dahomey with this emigration society.

CICERO
To get in high society
You need a great reputation,
Don't cultivate sobriety
But rather ostentation,
A lot of gold lay'd by in gilt-edged stocks,
A few town lots, let's say a dozen blocks,
A high-toned house that builded upon rocks,
Then you're in society!
To get in high society
I've always had an ambition,
And since I've got the brass, now we
Are sure to have position.
A royal prince my little girl shall wed,
For since the days of lords and dukes have sped,
It takes a prince to put you at the head
Of the best society!
PANSY
Surely you're only mocking,
Such levity is simply shocking
Your prince for me would be too far above
A royal prince is he I love.
Besides where is this prince for me to love?
CHORUS
CICERO

(South Fifth will do.)
And a prince who would spend all his time wooing you, (And your money too!)

Love looks not at estate. Oh No!
T'were folly one should think it so.
The beggar maid becomes a queen
Who through her lover's eyes is seen.
PANSY AND LEATHER
We care not for the world of fools
Love dignifies the soul ― it rules.
The pomp of kings the pride of state
Are naught when love o'er-takes the great.

Whose dwelling place love makes his own,
So all man's heart and being makes his own,
So all man's heart and being sing

1. In the text, there is no indication for the name of this song. As the role of Rosetta was played by Ada Overton Walker, she may have sung "Vassar Girl," a song she had made famous in Sons of Ham, and which was published in the London In Dahomey score. Another song for which she was known, "I Wants to be a Actor Lady," was published in the London score. At different times, she may have sung either, or a third song, "She's Dancing Sue." Here, the editors print the first two.
2. Her pantomime with the mirror was widely praised by critics.
3. The lyrics with their English stage references clearly indicate that the song was in the London production where it was sung with great success by Ada Overton Walker. Words by Vincent Bryan. English version by Arthur Trevelyen. Music by Harry von Tilzer.
4. Word and music were by V. Bryan and H. Von Tilzer. That the song Vassar Girl does not fit the continuity, is hardly an argument that it was not sung by Ada Overton Walker (Rosetta). Because the song was based on an actual incident where a "colored" girl passed for white at the all-girls school, it was a popular topic, and may well have been interpolated into the show.
5. This unidentified song, sung by the trio of Dr. Straight, Reeder, and Hustling Charlie, was probably "I May Be Crazy But I Ain't No Fool."

A detective is never supposed to get tired. Why Nick Carter or Old Sleuth would laugh at the idea of a detective wanting rest. At the rate we're going, it will be plumb dark before we get into the town.
SHYLOCK
I ain't worryin' about gittin' into the town. If those people find out we ain't no regular detectives, the thing to figure on is how to get out of town.
RAREBACK
You're just as much a detective as you're ever going to be. I can see now that you'll never be a Nick Carter or an Old Sleuth.
SHYLOCK
You always castin' up reflections. I never heard of dis man Nick Carter or old Hoof either. RAREBACK
Never heard of Nick Carter and Old Sleuth? Why, Shy, they're the greatest detectives in the world. Nick Carter is the only man living that's been shot through the heart forty-one times, and Old Sleuth's been knocked in the head with his arms tied behind him and a gag in his mouth and throwed in every sewer in the country.
SHYLOCK
With that kind of treatment as a regular diet, how long is a man supposed to last? RAREBACK
Why say, Shy, that ain't nothin'. Old Sleuth and Nick Carter were both sent out to a western town to trace up some bankrobbers. The robbers got word of it somehow and way-laid the train about thirty miles from town. Imagine a mountain pass about fifty thousand feet above the level of the sea, a bridge suspended in mid-air over a chasm one thousand feet deep. A stormy night. The snow falling thick and fast and not a ship to be seen. The robbers, after removing the middle span of the bridge, fled like specters down the track to a curve a hundred yards away, and there behind a huge boulder lay in wait for the train. On rushed the fast mail. Every passenger was asleep excepting Nick Carter and Old Sleuth, and they were playing pinochle in the smoking apartment of the car. Crack, crack, crack and the whiplike report of a gatling gun rang out on the midnight air. Nick Carter was seen to rise suddenly to his feet and take from the hat rack a bottle of rye whiskey, take a drink and light a cigar and coolly raise the window to prevent the broken glass from entering the wounds made by the bullets of the bandits. Old Sleuth, always on the alert, threw a keg of beer out of window, and the robbers ceased firing long enough to secure the beer, by which time the train was well on its way to the deadly bridge, little dreaming of the danger ahead. Nick Carter sat down to trim his corns, when Old Sleuth whose hearing was wonderfully acute said: "Nick, the middle span is out of that bridge ahead. I can hear the air sucking the broken rails. Something must be done and at once. Quick as a flash, Nick cut the bell cord

with his corn knife, plunged through the window, caught the telegraph wire, which broke with his weight and swung him over the chasm. Letting go the wire, he dropped to the bottom, attached the bell cord to the span that had been removed, which fortunately had landed on a bed of marsh and remained intact, passed the other end to Old Sleuth, who had by this time reached the cow catcher of the engine and with superhuman effort, the span was snatched in place, the lives of the sleeping passengers saved.
SHYLOCK
How deep did you say that chasm was?
RAREBACK
One thousand feet.
SHYLOCK
Then I suppose this Nick Carter having rubber soles on his shoes, hit himself on top de head and bounced back in de smoking department of de car and played pinochle till he got to town.
RAREBACK
Nothing so unreasonable as that occurred. An artificial lake at the head of the gap used as a reservoir became flooded and burst its banks, the torrent of water swept through the chasm and carried Nick Carter to the town thirty miles away and landed him on the platform of the depot just as the train pulled in with Old Sleuth standing on the cab of the engine smoking a Child's cigar.
SHYLOCK
I know it's taking advantage of good nature to ask any more questions, but would you kindly let me know if the robbers was apprehended.
RAREBACK
(laughing)
Now I can see that you are improving. Only a first-class detective would use that word "apprehended." Yes, they were caught after a number of even more blood-curdling incidents that I've related to you.

You know he traveled all over the world, and it seems to me he had everything put in this house that he had seen in anybody else's house, even these 'lectum lights, and then after all the trouble he went to, make everything so comfortable, he dropped out and didn't have a chance to enjoy it.
CECILIA LIGHTFOOT
Well, if he hadn't dropped out, you wouldn't have dropped in. Of course, it was very nice of old man Goodman to will you this property, and you ought to be very grateful to him for no other reason than that he outlived all his heirs.

He never thought nothin' of cuttin' a throat,
Or when it came handy of sinkin' a boat.
His name it was Kidd, though no youngster was he, He was like a tax gatherer who sailed on the sea. An' 'tis plain that by pirating, stealing, and sich, This Captain did grow most tremendously rich. CHORUS

And alas, I should tell it, he never came back. And so while a diggin' down there in my lot,
I chanced on unearthing the Captain's old pot.

Where the vines of brilliant lustre, Find mossy pillows;
Where the ferns so tall and slender Sway with the breeze,
There lived a lady frog, green pollywog was she;
Her lover tho' was one of brown.
Throughout the whole night long a little song sang he, And whispered for the moon was looking down.
( sung by male frog)
My lady frog of opal hue, Here on this log,
I sing to you.
Bright as the flies
That light this bog, So are your eyes, My lady frog.
( sung by chorus)
As the lovers sat a-waiting,
From o'er the way
Came a frog with chest a swelling,
A bull frog green.
Told he of a palace waiting,
In grand array,
How the lady of his dwelling,
Would be a queen.
And tho' 'tis sad to say, he took away this maid.
The frog of brown now croaks with pain,
And when the night is still, from o'er the hill, 'tis said You hear in mournful tones the old refrain.

( Exit Chorus and lights out. Change to Garden of the King of Dahomey) My Dahomian Queen
In Dahomey so grand,
Just along side the strand,
Lives a Moorish maid so near and dear to me. When I sought her heart and hand,
She made me understand
That if I wish'd my little bride she'd be. When the moon is brightly beamin',
From the azure skies a streamin',
In my cottage I'm a dreamin',
A dreamin' of our weddin' day.
Natives of exalted station,
Potentates from ev'ry nation.
Will be there to hear me when I say ― CHORUS
My Dahomian queen,
My dusky turtle dove,
What a beautiful scene,
Me and my lady love.
She's so sweet and serene,
Fresh from the jungle green,
She is my Kai-o-ka-lo-nian, 2 Royal Dahomian queen,
My Dahomian queen.
When I become a king,
All the jingle bells will ring,
While through the streets on palanquins we're borne. 'Twill be the grandest thing,
Just to hear the natives sing,
As loyally they fall before my throne.
Caboceers will be our sentry,
'Rabian knights will be our gentry,
The wonder of the twentieth century.
A-makin' even sunlight fade.
Seems the breezes will be sighin'
Nature with itself be a-vieing
A-singin' while my babe and I parade ―
( Repeat chorus)
( A women's drill team, costumed as Amazons, enters and executes a precision marching drill. They exit, and
a Dahomian explains their behavior as a local custom. Then the Caboceers march in singing) 3

Caboceers Entrance
We are the loyal subjects of King Eat-Em-All, The ruler over all our states both great and small. Great is his name, more great his fame,
Before his Majesty all nations prostrate fall. Forward with chargers dashing,
Their armor brightly flashing,
With bayonets a clashing
Like demons they hunt the fray.
The Caboceers! We greet with cheers!
The Caboceers, long be their years!
The Caboceers! We greet with cheers!
The Caboceers, long be their years!
Mighty their reign and glorious,
Their power all victorious,
Like gods of light before us
They come, the world to sway, to sway, to sway. CHORUS
Brightest vision of the morning,
Deign to glad our longing eyes.
Come and with thy wonderous coming,
Dim the lustre of the skies.
Mighty ruler of our nation,
Hail we thee with loud acclaim,
Great thy name and great thy station,
Caboceers, long may ye reign.
( Chorus enters as African chiefs, soldiers, natives, dancing girls. After march, chorus comes to front of stage, kneels and sings choral descriptive of glories of Cannibal King and Caboceers. At the middle of the choral, they rise at the words "Mighty ruler of our nation" and sway to and fro with swinging palm leaves. At the end, the chorus falls prostrate to the floor on their faces to greet SHYLOCK HOMESTEAD and RAREBACK PUNKERTON dressed as Caboceers. Song: "Every Darkey Is a King." Dialogue follows in which the box with cat's eye is found. CICERO LIGHTFOOT is disgusted with Dahomey and announces his return to America. The musical concludes with two rousing numbers: "Emancipation Day," and a triumphant cake-walk ― most popular dance of the era ― a production number that lasted twenty minutes.)
On Emancipation Day

All de alleys done turn'd out.

Makin' goo-goos at de show. CHORUS
On Emancipation Day,
All you white fo'ks clear de way.
Brass ban' playin' sev'ral tunes,
Darkies eyes look jes' lo'k moons,
Marshall of de day a struttin',
Lord but he is gay.
Coons dress'd up lak masqueraders,
Porters arm'd lak rude invaders.
When dey hear dem ragtime tunes,
White fo'ks try to pass fo' coons on Emancipation Day. Heah um cry,
My oh my,
When de'cession shows it head.
Majors brown
Ridin' down on cart hosses deck'd in red.
Teeth lak pearls,
Greet the girls standin' dere lak dusky storms.
Oh! my pet,
What a set of owdacious uniforms.
Generals stiff as hick'ry sticks
In de dress of seventy-six.

That's How the Cake Walk's Done
Cake-walking craze, it's a fad nowadays
With black folks and white folks too,
And I really declare it's done ev'rywhere,
Though it may be something new to you.
'Twas introduced years ago down in Dixie you know, By Black folks in Tennessee.
So just to show you,
I'm going to do
A cake walk of a high degree.
CHORUS
Bow to the right, bow to the left,
Then you proudly take your place.
Be sure to have a smile on your face,
Step high with lots of style and grace.
With a salty prance do a ragtime dance, Step way back and get your gun.
With a bow, look wise, make goo-goo eyes,

For that's the way the cake walk's done.
My Grandmother told me that she used to be
The best cake walker in the state,
When she walk'd down the line, lord, chile she did shine. But of course her style is out of date;
The Parisians, you know, they all walk just so,
They call it ze cake walk dance.
But with me you'll agree,
That the folks from Paree
In this cake walk would have no chance.
( Repeat chorus)
Many long years ago there was poor Old Black Joe; Use to walk just like this for a prize.
There was big Jasper Brown, the cake walker clown, Walk'd like this with his best gal Miss Lize.
Old Tildy Snow, and Bill Jones, with his rheumatic bones, To see them walk was fun.
With that old-style prance, they have no chance
When this iate-style cake walk is done.
( Repeat chorus) Swing Along4
Swing along chillun, swing along de lane; Lif' yo' head and yo' heels mighty high. Swing along chillun, 'taint a-goin' to rain, Sun's as red as de rose in de sky.
Come along Mandy, come along Sue,
White fo'ks a-watchin' an' seein' what you do,
White fo'ks jealous when you'se walkin' two by two, So swing along chillun, swing along.
We'll a swing along . . . yes a swing along,
An' a lif' a' yo' heads up high,
Wif' pride an' gladness beamin' from yo' eye.
We'll a swing along . . . yes a swing along,
From a early morn till night,
Lif' yo' head an' yo' heels mighty high
An' a swing both lef' an' right

Eyes like the stars of nighttime
Has my queen,
Tender as buds in springtime
Just sixteen.
CHORUS

Dear little dark-eyed Molly,
Always so gay and so jolly.
Who can help loving you,

My heart is pledg'd to Molly.
If Cholly loves Molly,
I don't think it folly to love her too. Down where the sad wavers murmur
To the sea,
On pleasant nights in summer
Oft were we,
Strolling along together,
Moll and me,
Whisp'ring that lovers ever we would be.

She ain't no violet,

An' tho' the lily of de valley's sweet,
She's sweeter yet I knows.
She ain't no tulip rare,
Nor mornin' glory fine,
But 'mongst de flowers fair,
Kaint none compare
Wid Brown-skin baby mine.
When we wed we won't go travellin' to no foreign lan', We doan' want no high-tone mansion, or no palace gran', What I keer bout sunny lt'ly, or de river Rhine?

I'm a Jonah Man6
My hard luck started when I was born, leas' so the old folks say. Dat same hard luck been my bes' fren' up to dis very day.
When I was young my mamma's frens to find a name they tried. They named me after Papa and the same day Papa died.
For I'm a Jonah,
I'm an unlucky man.
My family for many years would look on me and then shed tears, Why am I dis Jonah I sho' can't understand,
But I'm a good substantial full-fledged real first-class Jonah man.
A fren' of mine gave me a six-month meal ticket one day.
He said, "It wont do me no good, I've got to go away."
I thanked him as my heart wid joy and gratitude did bound.
But when I reach'd the restaurant the place had just burn'd down. For I'm a Jonah,
I'm a unlucky man.
It sounds just like that old, old tale,
But sometimes I feel like a whale.
Why am I dis Jonah I sho' can't understand,
But I'm a good substantial full-fledged real first-class Jonah man. My brother once walk'd down the street and fell in a coal hole.
He sued the man that owned the place and got ten thousand cold.
I figured this was easy so I jump'd in the same coal hole.
Broke both my legs and the Judge give me one year for stealin' coal. For I'm a Jonah,
I'm an unlucky man.
If it rain'd down soup from morn till dark,
Instead of a spoon I'd have a fork.
Why am I dis Jonah I sho' can't understand,
But I'm a good substantial full-fledged first-class Jonah man.
