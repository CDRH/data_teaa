<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
December 14th 1882</p>

<p>Hon: Wm. Hunter<lb/>
Asst. Secty of State.<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of 
your despatch No 10, in regard to Agents appointed
by me until approved by the Hon: Secty of State;
it was and still is with the intention of promoting
Am: Commerce in this part of the world, beside
putting a stop to runaway seaman, for abuse
received on board Am: whalers: and while 
enforcing the U.S. Law over this jurisdiction, to 
give prompt justice to seamen, masters or officers.
"Mossamedes" will in a few years become important
large fields of wheat, corn, sugar cane, and 
cotton are now in cultivation.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Govt. is organizing small colonies
all over that district, The Boërs in "Whilloh"
and "Humpata" are cutting conformity with 
the Portuguese a route from the interior; so 
that their crops, and the result of their <unclear>hunting</unclear> 
such as Hides, Ivory, &amp; Ostrich Feathers, can
be carried to Mossamedes: These colonies
as well as the Boërs; and even the natives 
of the interior who seem to follow now the

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0157.003"/>

example of the Boërs, will soon want
Farming implements; and I do not
know if any to be compared with those
of the U.S. for simplicity, durability and 
cheapness. The merchants and large
land holders will need also steam
mills, and other machinery for making
Rum, Sugar, grinding corn and wheat, 
cleaning and pressing cotton &amp;a &amp;a
Am: Whalers seem to make their head quarters
now at the place, although the best inducements
have been granted to them by the Portuguese govt.
at Loanda.</p>

<p>I understand that nine whalers were 
there during the last two months. From the 
"Eliza Adams" three seamen ran away, and 
from the " Alice Knowles" a man was discharged
by reason of sickness; these seamen have
been sent to me from Mossamedes at a 
great expense, and I find myself compelled
to keep them until I am able to forward
them to Santiago "Cape de Verde" by mail steamers,
which only takes them occasionally, more
as a favor, although I pay to the Capt.
£5.0.0, for each man.</p>

<p>Mr. J. L. Torres that I appointed until
approved by the Hon: Secty of State is the 
largest merchant of Mossamedes, a young

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0157.004"/>

man, full of energy, and ambitions to 
promote the commerce and development
of Mossamedes.</p>

<p>It is only upon close inquiry, as to his
capacity, integrity, capability &amp;a &amp;a that 
I appointed him. If the State Dept has
any objections to these appointments, I 
will notify them at once as not having 
been accepted by the State Dept.</p>

<p>I have never seen either of the gentlemen
at Ambriz, Benguella &amp; Mossamedes;
but I am confident that an agent is 
needed at Mossamedes for the interest
of Am: Commerce and protection of
Am: Seamen and others visiting that 
port.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
L. de R. du Verge</p>

<note>N.B. This is the only kind of paper that can be 
obtained in Loanda.</note>
