<p>Commercial Agency of the 
United States of America 
at Sierra Leone<lb/>
19th November 1866.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Having by a dispatch, 
No 1, and dated May 24, from 
the Department of State, received 
a commission as 
Commercial Agent of the 
United States for Sierra Leone 
and the dependencies 
thereof, I beg to thank the 
Department and will to 
the best of my ability endeavor 
to carry out its instructions 
as received from time to time.</p>

<p>I called upon, and acquainted 
His Excellency Colonel 
Samuel W. Blackall, the Governor in Chief of my <catchwords>appointment</catchwords>

<fw type="address">F. W. Seward Esq<lb/>
Assistant Secretary<lb/>
&amp;c &amp; &amp;c</fw>

<pb n="95"/>

appointment and at the same 
time presented him with 
my commission to examine, 
he appeared not to perfectly 
understand the office and 
desired that he might correspond 
with the home Government 
before officially recognizing 
of course I could not refuse.</p>

<p>Therefore as it is of great 
importance that the Consular 
officer of the United 
States in this Colony should 
be fully recognized on account 
of out commercial 
interests and especially as there 
is a large British Dependency, 
I beg to request that 
the Department will apply 
for an exequatur for me from 
the British Government.</p>

<p>The oath is enclosed, I 
have sworn to it before a 
Police Magistrate in this 
<catchwords>place</catchwords>

<pb n="96"/>

place, the bond I have 
signed before two witnesses 
here and enclosed to T. A. 
Sweetser Esq of South Danvers
Mass, to obtain sureties
for me after which he will 
forward it to the Department 
of State.</p>

<p>The Consuls Manual,
list of Diplomatic and Consular 
officers and several of 
the Circulars issued by the 
Department are also duly received.</p>

<p>I was born in Salem 
Massachusetts and was 
appointed from the same 
place.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
Henry Rider</p>
