<note>Department of State Received Jul 1 1884</note>

<p>United States Consulate<lb/>
St Paul de Loanda<lb/>
14 June 1883.</p>

<p>To the Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to lay below the Department
of State the following circumstances connected with
the discharge of my duties as Vice-Consul for the 
United States at this port. Mr L. de R du Verge
left Loanda for the Congo on the 16th ultimo by the
<sic>Portugese</sic> Mail Steamer for the purpose it is reported
of arranging with Mr Stanley the details of the post he
has accepted under the Belgian Expedition without 
handing over to me the Archives of the Consulate or
acquainting me as to whether I should be able
to have access to any documents or forms which
might be required, although I saw that officer on
the day of his departure.</p>

<p>Had there been no immediate Consular duties
to perform I should have waited the return of Mr
Du Verge for an explanation of this, and also for an
explanation on a matter of a personal nature which
has recently come to light.</p>

<p>The facts of the case are these: On the arrival
on the third inst. of the wrecked crew of the American
Whaler "Merlin" lost South of Mossamedes, I called at 
the house of Mr T Marti, a Swiss, holding a Dry
Goods Retail Shop where Mr Du Verge had hired a 
room as his residence and offices, Mr Marti who
possesses the key gave me permission to enter but
would not permit me to take the Ships Register as
the Archives he said were left in his charge and I am 
<catchwords>unable</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30019"/> 

unable to register my official correspondence in the
proper Official Book which appeared to be locked away.</p>

<p>Wishing to take to my Office the Ships
Register did not appear to me any infraction of
the rules or had Mr Marti any official right or 
Authority to interfere with me, for in the first place
the room offered no facilities for writing, and in
the Second I could not without great inconvenience
to myself obtain the assistance of my mercantile Clerk
to write up the register.</p>

<p>That Mr Marti who does not possess the
highest reputation for soberness or mercantile stability
should be entrusted with the Archives and superintend
my actions over them, shows a want of official
consideration by Mr Du Verge and is moreover contrary 
to the instructions.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances and not
possessing the key of the room no responsibility can
be attached to me for the safety of the Consular
papers but I shall endeavour to exercise such
supervision over them as is consistent with my 
relations with Mr Marti.</p>

<p>It may be inferred that there exists a
difference between Mr Du Verge and myself but such
is not the case if his friendly pretensions are to be 
considered as a proof of his sincerity and I am
quite at a loss to understand what motive he has 
to pass me over in matters appertaining to the
Consulate with which I have been connected for
a long period having been appointed to my present
position since 1868. And for many years have been 
in sole charge of the office without, I venture to 
state, giving the Department any cause of complaint
<catchwords>or</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan30020"/> 

or in any way failed to discharge the duties faithfully
and conscientiously</p>

<p>I may also state that my long residence
here as Merchant and holding the post of British-Vice-Consul 
which I presume is not incompatible with
my position as United States Vice-Consul, give me
a status that facilitates considerably the settlement
of Consular business with the local authorities, with
whom I have always been on the most friendly and
intimate relationship.</p>

<p>The information that has been given regarding
myself personally is that Mr Marti has failed to obtain
any one here to sign a bond for him to be Vice Consul at
Loanda, from which I infer that Mr Du Verge has
applied to the Department to have me substituted but 
on what ground I am unable to say.</p>

<p>In submitting the foregoing matters for the
information of the Department I have the honor to 
request that should there be no reason why I should
not continue to hold the post of Vice-Consul, that 
Mr Du Verge should be instructed to consign the
Archives of the Consulate to my charge whenever he
may absent himself and, should it be deemed
expedient, to call upon him to explain his reasons
for shewing such discourtesies to me, as I am
not his inferior save in official rank.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your most Obedient Servant<lb/>
(s/d) Robert Scott Newton</p>
