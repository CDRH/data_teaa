<note>Department of State Received Jan 24 1887</note>

<p>Gaboon, West Africa<lb/>
Dec. 1st 1886.</p>    
    
<p>Hon Jas. D. Porter.<lb/> 
Acting Secretary<lb/>
Washington U.S.A</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Your two despatches
of the 2nd of Oct. last have been
received.</p> 

<p>The two despatches referred to, are:</p>

<p>First, the official notice of the 
acceptance of the resignation of 
Graham C. Campbell.</p>

<p>Second, the official notice that I 
have been appointed "Acting Commercial
Agent" of Gaboon.</p>

<p>Enclosed with these two despatches 
was a "form of official bond," to 
be executed by myself, and returned 
to the Department.</p>

<p>Permit me, in reply to say that
I respectfully decline to execute 
the Bond. And for the following 
reason. Necessarily a great
length of time must elapse 
before my letter could reach you. 

<pb facs="20170615_145742"/>

And a longer time before I 
could secure the signatures of 
Bondsmen in America.</p>

<p>And in addition to that, the time 
necessary for you to obtain the 
recognition of the French Government,
and afterwards remit 
to me the Certificate of Assortment.
Already more than 
three months have passed since
the official notice was given from 
this office by Graham C. Campbell,
that he would leave.</p>

<p>This is, of course, due only to the 
length of time necessary for the 
exchange of letters.</p>

<p>Perhaps, for the present, I may 
not remain here longer than three 
or four months.</p>

<p>And it will be well nigh impossible
for me to receive the Certificate 
before the expiration 
of that time.</p>

<p>I shall continue to care for 
the office&#8212;the furniture and 

<pb facs="20170615_145750"/>

the books&#8212;until I find it necessary 
to return to America.</p>

<p>Then I will leave the care of these 
things to the member of this 
Mission, who will succeed me 
at this station.</p>

<p>I am not aware that I, who have been 
Acting Com. Agt. only, have
any authority, even to name a 
successor.</p>

<p>Allow me to suggest that I and 
others of our Mission think it 
would be well for the government 
of the U.S. to enquire into the 
trade of this part of the Coast.
One English firm, and one German 
firm, do an immense 
trade here, besides smaller firms.
But still there is a demand 
for some American productions,
<sic>superceding</sic> the demand there 
is for either English or German 
of some sort. Notably so
the lighter and better. American 
edge tools, such as axes, saws, 

<pb facs="20170615_145810"/>

plows, chisels, the plain, 
substantial American furniture,
and American pine lumber 
for building purposes.</p>

<p>Only one American sailing 
vessel calls regularly at this 
port, and that about twice a year.
Our profession forbids us giving 
as much time to the collection 
of statistics in regard to trade, imports
exports, as should be done by the one 
holding this office.</p>

<p>I trust that I way to able to 
gather a fine statistics concerning 
trade on this part of the Coast.</p>

<p>For the present<lb/>
I remain<lb/>
Yours respectfully,<lb/>
W. C. Gaulk</p>
