<note>No. 18</note>
<note>Department of State Received Mar 22 1892</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
<del>St. Paul de</del> Loanda, Febr. 2, 1892</p>

<p>Mr. Heli Chatelain<lb/>
To the Department of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>How to take oath for Form No. 101</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents</p>

<p>(1) To the practice followed at this Consulate,
of having this oath administrated by Consul
to himself, simply witnessed by a <sic>responsable</sic>
person approved by the Department?</p>

<p>(2) The particular oath is understood
in American and required for Form No. 101
does not exist in Portuguese law, and nobody 
is authorized to administer it.</p>

<p>(3) A clear understanding between the 
U.S. government and Consuls in Portuguese
Possessions on this point is desirable.</p>

<note>No. 18</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda, Febr. 2, 1892</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>According to Par 503 Consular Regulations, 
the oath required for Form No. 101
is to be taken before a person having authority
to administer oaths</p>

<p>As appears from enclosed note of Mr.
Bannister and my remarks which follow,
the practice of this Consulate on this point
has not been according to the letter either
of Par. 503 or of Portuguese law. To settle
my scruples and those of any honest Consular 
officer in Portuguese Possessions this 
point ought to be definitely regulated by the
Department.</p>

<p>For my first oath to Form No. 101, I 
was governed by the practice of the Consulate.
Closer study and reflection made me doubt
its legality and I went for the second oath,

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0576.003"/>

to a notary public, "tabelliãs". He refused
to administer the oath, stating that he was not
authorized to do so by law. In order to settle 
this point and find out whether any other 
functionary could perform that office, I called
on a Judge who knows English and is the 
highest authority in the Province on questions of
law, and I laid the question before him.
His answer was that the Portuguese law
recognizes only two kinds of oaths: (1) the 
oath of office of public functionaries, administered 
by a judge (2) the judicial oath, administered
by the judge in court. Any other oath is not
legal, and any functionary administering it 
makes himself liable to prosecution. The signed
declaration of a party is as binding as an oath could
be and the only thing a notary public can do
is to legalize the signature, thus preventing doubts
as to the genuineness of the signature.</p>

<p>Trusting the Department will either sanction 
the course hitherto pursued at this Consulate
or clearly state how that oath is to be taken 
in the future, I have the honor to be, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Coml Agent</p>

<p>1 Enclosure: Mr. Bannister's note</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0576.004"/>

<p>Dear Mr. Chatelain,</p>

<p>1- At one time it was the
custom to have one "Record of
Fees" form swore to before a 
"Tabelliãs" and signed by him
(gratis). I had so much trouble
in hunting one up at times
that I simply wore to the
Record before any responsible
person of good standing and
got his signature and no question
was ever raised. The Record has
to be sent in complete, Fees or
no Fees. The book is not signed.</p>

<p>2- I was not present when the
supply of stationary was opened
and as no list was forthcoming
I am ignorant of the contents
of the p'kge. I always used
any inkstand in the office
that i could lay my hands on.</p>

<p>I will make further enquires.</p>

<p>Yours very truly,<lb/>
Ed: Bannister</p>
