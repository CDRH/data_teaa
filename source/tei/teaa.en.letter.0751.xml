<p>No 40. U S Consulate. Goree-Dakar<lb/>
April 15th 1886</p>

<p>Mr Peter Strickland<lb/>
To the Department of State</p>

<p>Subject</p>

<p>War between the French
and Marabouts on the
Senegal River. Bakel closely
invested by the natives and
relief for the garrison difficult</p>

<pb n="20170619_140020"/>

<p>No 40. U S Consulate. Goree-Dakar<lb/>
April 15th 1886</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
James D Porter<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Advices from Bakel, a military 
and trading post in the midst of
the Gum district some 400 miles up the
Senegal River, state that the place
is besieged by about 8000 natives.
Several European troops have already
been killed, and fears are entertained
that the small garrison of less than
100 men must be captured before
Succours can arrive.</p>

<p>Such is the substance of the
latest news, which is chiefly of
importance as it concerns the fate
of the <sic>beleagered</sic> garrison and a 
possible temporary suspension of the
Senegal gum trade which since Gum
has ceased in a measure to be exported

<pb n="20170619_14033"/>

from the Soudan has grown to 
considerable proportions.</p>
    
<p>There is no apprehension here of 
a Mahdi, and the report of one in 
this part of Africa which has gained 
credence in some quarters is probably 
without much foundation. Incidents 
like the one now occurring at Bakel
are as common in this country as
outbreak among our Indians, and 
to the world at large are of no more
importance. It is thought by many,
too, that some military men stationed
at distant posts often provoke such 
disturbances in order that they may 
serve as means for rapid promotion.
And where warriors can be the sole 
reporters of their own exploits their
deeds are seldom likely to lose
much luster in narration.</p>

<p>I am Sir<lb/>
Respectfully yours<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
U S Consul</p>
