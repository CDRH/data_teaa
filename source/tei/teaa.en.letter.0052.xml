<p>St Paul 'd Loanda March 3, 1864</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>It has become my painful duty to inform your
Department that Mr John T. Bradberry late US Coml Agent for
this Port died in my house on the 28 ulto of Fever.</p>

<p>His funeral was attended by the Gov. Genl of this Province, the
Brazilian Consul, English Consul &amp; Vice Consul &amp; many friends. He was
buried in the English Cemetery on the 29th with all the honors of a U.S. 
Coml Agent. At his grave a "Guard of honor" were stationed who fired
the customary salute in accordance with his Station.</p>

<p>I have informed his Family at Baltimore of this sad event &amp;
the particulars of his death. As Mr Bradberry did not have any
Property of amount I shall pay the expenses of his sickness &amp; funeral,
which together with what he previously owed me will probably amount
to $200. for which I trust the Department will be accountable. By
first opportunity I will send his Quarterly Returns from Jany 1st to the
25th Feby together with any further particulars which time now compels
me to postpone.</p>

<p>The Flags, Papers, Seal &amp;c belonging to the Agency are
now in my charge, but as the "Junta da Fazende" have taken an Inventory
of his private effects. they may perhaps also do the same with
the Agency, but I am given to understand the matter will probably
be left in my care.</p>

<p>As this Port is left without a U.S. Consul a Agent
I would very respectfully offer my services for the same, &amp; any advices
Your Honor may be pleased to send me, you can do so via
Lisbon, Fernando Po, or to the care of Messrs Brookhouse &amp; Hunt of Salem
Mass. to whom I would refer for Character &amp; Ability to fill the office
