<note>Department of State Received Jan 27 1891</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, November 19, 1890.</p>

<p>Mr. Ed Bannister<lb/>
To the Department of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Claim of Mrs Holmes.</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.</p>

<p>Reply to claim, and grounds 
of sauce, as set forth by Mrs
Holmes, widow of late Captain
Holmes of barque "Sea Fox," for
effects of his alleged to have
been stolen from that vessel
while at Anchor in Loanda.</p>

<note>No 23.</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
Loanda, November 19, 1890</p>

<p>Honorable W. F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your despatch dated
September 11, 1890, enclosing a copy 
of a letter from Mrs Adelaide W
Holmes to the Department of
State in which that lady claims
the sum of <unclear>Rs</unclear> 360.00 for property
belonging to her late husband
and alleged by her to have been 
robbed from the Cabin of the barque
"Sea Fox" (of which vessel he was
Captain) when the arrived in Loanda
and was placed in the charge of the 
officials of the Port. This claim she
makes on the ground of the "inefficiency
or <del>incompetency</del> neglect" of the Consul at
Loanda.</p>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.003"/>

<p>The whole of the Sad circumstances
attending the explosion on board
the vessel in question were reported
at the time by Vice Consul Newton
to the Department. I will therefore
confine my reply, to the allegations
contained in the claim set forth.</p>

<p>1st "That with the assistance
of a Portuguese national vessel
their <unclear>lying</unclear> in or near Equimina
the "Sea Fox" was taken to St. Paul
de Loanda."</p>

<p>The Portuguese national
vessel took a number of burnt
and wounded men to Loanda
but had nothing to do with taking
the ship there. The Vice Consul
sent a man by the Earliest opportunity
to bring her to this port.</p>

<p>2nd "That at the instance of said
consul or through his agency, Customs
officers were put on board the said
"Sea Fox""</p>

<p>The Customs officers were sent
on board by the Director of Customs
<catchwords>as</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.004"/>

as is done according to law in every
case of arrival of a vessel in port,
and the Consul has nothing whatever
to do with such proceeding.</p>

<p>3rd "And that during the 
time the ship was in charge of the
said officials, the Captain's entire
effects, previously scheduled by the
Consul or his agent, and consisting
of clothing &amp;c, &amp;c. were stolen and
taken from the ship."</p>

<p>When the vessel arrived here
the V Consul was at Mossamedes
very ill, and the writer acting
for him, immediately proceeded
on board and found the entire
space which had once been occupied
by the Cabin, a black, foul smelling
hole without a vestige of Cabin
from side to side and from deck
to Keelson, the result of the explosion,
and the fire consequent thereon
which the crew said raged for
some time.</p>

<p>Burnt and otherwise mutilated
<catchwords>portions</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.005"/>

portions of written matter,
unrecognizable as documents
of importance or otherwise, were 
<unclear>lying</unclear> scattered about the desk
which was shewn with wreckage
caused by the explosion. On my 
asking if anything belonging
to the Captain had been saved
(simply with a view to secure
for his friends some souvenir),
the reply was in the following
terms as far as my memory
serves me, and I know that at 
the time if made a great impression
on me, considering the awful
circumstances: "My God
Sir, do you think any one thought
of anything else when he recovered
from the shock but putting
out the fire and saving the
ship from going right down
under us"</p>

<p>There remained more than
20 men of the crew, and they
demanded to be taken ashore

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.006"/>

and provided for. I had to
make provision for them (they
had neither food nor place to 
sleep in), and also provide
for the ship's safety and that
of her cargo. The man who 
brought the vessel from Equimina
said he would not have gone
for her if he had known what
he would have to put up with.
He had to sleep (when he could)
on the open deck, there was 
no food except a little fish
and sweet potatoes, and when
he arrived here he was in a
high state of fever.</p>

<p>I would ask respectfully
if under such circumstances
the Consul's duty was to hurt
up a few trinkets or other articles
(which I am firmly convinced
did not exist), or do his duty
by the ship, her cargo and the 
crew?</p>

<p>"The Captain's entire effects
<catchwords>previously</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.007"/>

previously scheduled by the
Consul or his agent."</p>

<p>I will refrain from making
any comment on this assertion,
but respectfully ask the Department
to demand from the concocters
of this claim the list of effects
"scheduled by the Consul or
his Agent" with the signature
of the Consul, or his agent attached.</p>

<p>4th. "And that upon representation
of the robbery being made to the 
Consul by the Captain who had
been sent to St Paul de Loanda
to bring the ship to her home
port, the Consul replied that
nothing could he done about"
it".</p>

<p>This of course implies that
a list as set forth in the claim
and "as scheduled by the Consul"
or his agent" really existed. Let
them produce it. In the
absence of Mr Newton, late 
Vice Consul, I have no means of
<catchwords>verifying</catchwords>    

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.008"/>

verifying the truth of such 
alleged conversation. Considering
however the character of Mr
Newton, the conscientious manner
in which he performed the duties
of this Consulate for a period
extending over twenty years as
I gather from the archives, and
his willingness at all times to
assist in getting justice done
even where he is not personally
concerned, confirm me in the
opinion that either the whole
truth regarding such reply of
his as alleged, is suppressed, or
that it is entirely imaginary
on the part of Captain Luce
or whoever is responsible
for the statement.</p>

<p>To establish the claim I again
submit that it is necessary
for the claimant to produce
the list "as scheduled by the
Consul or his Agent" duly
authenticated by the signature
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0548.009"/>

of such Consul or Agent; and 
in conclusion would ask if 
the Consul is responsible to the
owners for safe delivery of property
from the time their agent takes
change in a foreign port until 
he delivers such property in the
home port. If any robbery was 
committed it may have been
done in such interval.</p>

<p>I trust the Department
will accept my assurance 
that all the foregoing is simply
in answer to the claim and the
terms in which it is made, and
I should regret very much if
any single phrase should be
construed as showing a want
of the high respect due from 
me to the Department.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your most obedient<lb/>
servant<lb/>
Ed Bannister.<lb/>
Vice Consul.</p>
