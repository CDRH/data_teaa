<p>Consulate of the United States of America<lb/>
Bathurst 1 May 1874</p>
    
<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose for 
your Excellency's information copy
of a letter received today at this 
Consulate from Mr J J Rider an
American Citizen and Consignee of 
the American barque Jennie
Cashman of Boston, in which he 
complains that, having paid the 
tonnage dues on this vessel in 
January last, for the whole of the 
year 1874 under the tonnage
ordinance (section 4) of the 18th April
1860 then in force he was yesterday 
called upon by the Custom House
authorities here, and compelled to
pay (which he did under protest
<catchwords>a</catchwords>
    
<fw type="address">To His Excellency
C. H. Kortright<lb/>
Governor</fw>
    
<pb n="20170616_111252"/>
    
a second tonnage due, under the 
ordinance of the 31st March 1874 upon
the same vessel, within the year,
for which he has already paid</p>    
    
<p>Therefore other American vessels
that like the Jennie Cashman have
already paid the annual tonnage
for the current year, and will on
their return within the year, have 
the same cause of complaint
I respectfully submit that there
exists just and equitable reasons for 
seeking relief from your Excellency 
from this second payment by 
vessel that have already paid 
for was much as the tonnage
imposed under the 4th Section of the 
ordinance of the 18th April 1860
    
<pb n="20170616_111259"/>
    
was an annual charge which 
having been once paid gave 
vessels the right to enter all the 
year for which the payment was
made free from a repetition of
the charge, it thus became a 
tacit agreement, between the 
Government &amp; the ship owner
who upon the faith of it
chartered his vessel and made 
his engagements it is therefore
hard upon him to pass an
ordinance &amp; to give it retrospective
effect, tho' it is not so expressed
in the ordinance itself.</p>
    
<p>Soliciting your Excellency's
consideration of the case, with 
high consideration</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obdt st<lb/>
Thomas Brown<lb/>
Actg Vice Consul for the 
United States of America</p>
