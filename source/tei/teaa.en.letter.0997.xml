<note>Department of State Received Feb 27 1880</note>

<p>No. 38.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States,<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, Nov. 14, 1879.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Smyth to the Ass't Secretary, State</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Health statistics.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>

<p>The geographical situation of Monrovia, opinion of Dr. David–as data from which the healthfulness and unhealthfulness of this section is derived.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-2227.jpg"/>

<p>No. 38.</p>

<p>Consulate Gen'l of the United States,<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia, Nov. 14, 1879.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>You will observe that in my No. 33, date Sept. 17th, 1879, my reply to your Circular–"Separate", June 24, 1879.</p>

<p>At this time–having gathered some information as to the health of Monrovia, I take pleasure in furnishing the same for the benefit of the Department and the "National Board of Health".</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon. F. W. Seward,<lb/>
Ass't Sec'y of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</fw>

<pb n="Roll3-2228.jpg"/>

The city of Monrovia is situated on Cape Messurado which at its northern extremity is a broad, high promontory–rich in varied tropical <sic>vegitation</sic>.</p>

<p>The northern elevation slopes abruptly to the South, forming of the city proper a valley, which is bounded on the east by the mouths of the St. Paul and Messurado rivers and Stockton Creek. The northern and western boundaries–the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p>The cape becomes narrow gradually, and is narrowest at the southern limit of the city.</p>

<p>To the north of St. Paul's river mouth, to the south of said river <catchwords>between</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2229.jpg"/>

between it and Stockton creek, and bordering the eastern side of the Messurado river, are dense mangrove swamps. In addition to these–there is a swamp in the city, just beyond its <sic>centre</sic>–extending from the base of the promontory nearly the entire length of the city.</p>

<p>The presence of <sic>Sylla</sic> and <sic>Carybdis</sic>, these swamps, renders the city at certain seasons of the year, the commencement of the rains and the beginning of the dries, necessarily unhealthy–from the exhalations of dead and decaying <sic>vegitable</sic> substances, which produce <catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2230.jpg"/>

the so much dreaded, malaria fevers.</p>

<p>At no time in the history of the Republic, has any <sic>contageous</sic> disease assumed, here, an epidemic form.</p>

<p>There have been a few cases of small-pox–brought from the leeward by Kroo men–but have been of short duration.</p>

<p>On the whole this portion of western Africa, I mean the whole Liberian coast, is one of the most healthy.</p>

<p>Kidney affections are of a frequent occurrence, and are shown in that particular form <catchwords>known</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2231.jpg"/>

known as Bright's disease or <sic>Albuminurria</sic>.</p>

<p>Liver complaints are very prevalent, and are due to <sic>to</sic> malarial influences.</p>

<p>In the hot seasons–great care must be exercised as to dietary, as diarrhoea and dysentery are of frequent occurrence, and often prove fatal.</p>

<p>Cerebral affections are not <sic>uncomon</sic>. These appear in the form of malarial fever, but, even that, is not so bad as <unclear>writers</unclear> on African fever have represented, it being nothing more than the type of <sic>remittent</sic> and intermittent fever, which are peculiar <catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb n="Roll3-2232.jpg"/>

to portions of the United States.</p>

<p>For the year ending October 31st, 1879, there have been twenty one (21) deaths in the city.</p>

<p>There is here a population of about 2,000.</p>

<p>The subjoined table, and the foregoing information (in the general) were furnished by Dr. J. W. Y. David, a practicing physician, and a native of this city.</p>

<pb n="Roll3-2233.jpg"/>

Deeming it of value to the Department as well as to the "National Board of Health"–to have the foregoing data, I have concluded that it would be proper to send this dispatch to the Department.</p>

<p>With renewed assurances of esteem, I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obd't serv't,<lb/>
Jno. H. Smyth,<lb/>
U.S. Minister Resd't &amp; Consul General.</p>
