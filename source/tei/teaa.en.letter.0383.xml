<p>H. M. S. "Danae"<lb/>
Sierra Leone, 19th October 1869.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>On the occasion of my visiting the 
Island of Anno Bon on the 25th August 1869, 
the Master of the American Whaling Schooner
"Herald" informed me that an American 
Citizen, by name Claude Payrott had 
been left on the Island sick and in a 
destitute condition, there being no constituted
authority on the Island, although claimed 
by Spain I took the man on board this ship 
for Medical care. He was then in a 
very emaciated condition but is now convalescent,
but hardly fit to be landed at an 
African Port; I await your decision as to

his disposal.</p>

<p>I am bound for Halifax, Nova 
Scotia; if you make me a requisition 
to that effect, I will convey him to 
Halifax and place him in the hands 
of the United States Consul at that place.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
