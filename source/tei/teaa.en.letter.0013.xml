<p>United States Commercial Agency<lb/>
St Paul 'd Loanda May 5, 1859</p>

<p>Sir.</p>

<p>On the 26th January last, I had
the honor of addressing you, enclosing the Returns
of the Commercial Agency for the Quarter ending
Dec 31st 1858 &#38; at same time drawing for
$244.07 being balance of my Salary for that
Quarter.</p>

<p>In that Despatch I gave some particulars
respecting this Coast, the arrival of Sir
Henry V Huntley, HBM Consul for this Port,
Slave Trade &#38;c. which I trust has been received.</p>

<p><sic>Accompaning</sic> this I enclose the Returns from
this Commercial Agency for the Quarter ending
March 31st 59 &#38; have drawn on your Honor for
$238.89 being balance of my Salary for that
Quarter.</p>

<p>In my last I gave an estimate of the 
American Trade at this Port, which I trust
will serve the same purpose as if I entered the
amount of the Inward &#38; Outward Cargoes in the
Returns, which estimate can be now placed at
One hundred thousand dollars per annum.</p>

<p>It is reported now that the U.S.S. "Marion"
has taken as Prizes in the Congo River a Bark

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0013.002"/>

called the "Orion" of New York &#38; another Bark
name not reported. HBM Steamer "Triton"  
Comr Burton had the "Orion" in tow, one or two
days previous to the arrivals there of the "Marion", while
at the same time the "Orion" had the American Ensign
flying. Capt Brent of the "Marion" will undoubtedly
inform his Department of the particulars in
this case.</p>

<p>It is also reported that the U.S. Government
have made a proposition to England, that they
will place on this Coast Ten Steamers of two Guns each,
instead of the Eighty Guns in large vessels. If so, it
will do much in stopping the Slave Trade on this Coast.</p>

<p>As a Depot for Coals or Provisions, Loanda has 
not its equal on the Coast of Africa. For further 
particulars respecting the advantages of this place, I 
respectfully refer you to my former despatches.</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
a despatch from your Department under date of Dec.
13th 1858 advising me of the resignation of Mr Miller
&#38; requesting me to continue in the discharge of the
duties of the office, till the further pleasure of the
President is ascertained, which request I respectfully
comply with.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Your Most Obt. Servt<lb/>
John G. Willis.</p>

<p>Hon Lewis Cass<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>May 6.</p>

<p>A small topsail Schooner name not
yet given, was towed in here yesterday by HBM
Steamer "Triton", which vessel was taken off Mazula
about 40 Miles to the North of Loanda, without flag
or papers. She was 3 months from Havana &#38; had
Six hundred doubloons on board. I have not
seen any person belonging to her; but get my information
from HBM acting Commissioner. The
"Triton" after coaling here, will leave with her Prize
for St. Helena.</p>
