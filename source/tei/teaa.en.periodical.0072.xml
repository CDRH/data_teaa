<div2 type="article">

<p>The acquittal of Rev. W. H. Sheppard, the American Negro missionary, on the charges of libel at Leopoldville, Belgian Congo, brought an end to the most important and perhaps helpful trial ever conducted in the Congo. The Belgian Government in reality admits the heinous crimes so long charged against it. Her officials tried the case. They own one-half the stock of the commission company which has a monopoly of rubber gathering in the Kasai region, and a majority of the company directors are Belgian officials. The suit has been considered as one by the Belgian Government. The prosecution of the two courageous missionaries, one white and the other black, has brought their charges of tyrannically impressing whole villages for rubber gathering, oppressive taxation and wholesale cruelty into the limelight. The American Government, through the consul at Boma, followed the case, giving him instructions to exercise appropriate good offices if the occasion required.</p>

<p>America has thus assumed in part the responsibility which is hers for the good government of the Congoes. It has not been known until this trial that she has taken any unusual interest in the reports of horrible and wholesale torture coming from many and reliable sources. Now that these informers have been vindicated by Belgium herself, their information must be acted upon. America and England, as Sir Conan Doyle recently said are in duty bound to help the Congo, America as in the past, and elsewhere, should live up to her duty.</p>
