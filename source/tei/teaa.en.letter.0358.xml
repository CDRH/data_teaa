<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Zanzibar, January 11 1891</p>

<p>Honorable Wm F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honour to
forward herewith copies of a
correspondence relating to an
additional duty levied on
imports to the German East
African Coast of Zanzibar,
and to address the Department
briefly regarding the same</p>

<p>The Dominion of the
Sultan of Zanzibar formerly
comprised the whole of the
East Central African Coast
and adjacent islands until
this year, when the Sultan
was induced by Germany
<catchwords>and England</catchwords>

<pb n="155735"/>

and England to sell
to the former his sovereign
rights in about 400 miles
of this Coast, (transferred <unclear>2nd</unclear>/1/91)
leaving for himself the
islands of Zanzibar and
Bomba and a small piece
of Coast to the North, all
under a British Protectorate.</p>

<p>By the treaties with
Zanzibar, it is specially
provided that goods which
have paid 5% duty once
shall pass free through
any ports of Zanzibar
territory, and it has been
customary to import to
the island of Zanzibar
all goods intended for
East African trade and
paying duty there, <unclear extent="one word"/>
to the various Coast ports,
the island acting merely
as a distributing center
and not as a <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<pb n="155740"/>

<p>On December 22d last,
notice was received from
the German Consulate,
that, from Jan'y 1, 1891,
"the duty" would be taken
on the German Coast
for account of the German
Government, meaning that
5% duty would be levied
on all goods imported to 
the German Coast, whether
they had previously paid
to the Zanzibar Customs 
or not. This duty is
now in force there.</p>

<p>The American house
of Mess. Roper, <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co.
hold in this city a lot of
goods destined expressly
for the German Coast, on
which they have paid 5%
duty to the Zanzibar Customs,
and on their representing
this fact to me and also
the impossibility of making
<catchwords>shipping</catchwords>

<pb n="155746"/>

shipping and storage
arrangements in the
space of eight days. I
filed a protest against
this duty being levied
with the German Consul,
as per copy inclosed.</p>

<p>At the same time
I addressed H. H. the Sultan
through the British Agency,
protesting against another
duty being allowed to be
charged on goods already
passed at Zanzibar, and
claimed a free market,
or a drawback on all
American duty-paid goods
here for export to said Coast.
In reply, the British Agent
states that he is in a
similar situation in regard
to British subjects and is
unable to make any statement 
until he is advised
by his Government, to
<catchwords><unclear extent="one word"/></catchwords></p>

<pb n="155750"/>

<gap extent="one page" reason="illegible image"/>

<pb n="155757"/>

<p>I am of the opinion
that, as the Sultan only
could sell something that
he possessed and he never
possessed the right to levy
a second duty of 5% on
goods duty-paid in Zanzibar, 
the Germans have
no legal rights to levy
such duty, and the 
Sultan is responsible for
allowing this state of things
(of course it being understood 
that the Sultan
is but a name, England
being the responsible party)
As contracting party to
the treaties the Sultan
has agreed that one duty
of 5% passes all goods free
through all ports of his
dominions, and I believe
him to be responsible for
any <unclear extent="one word"/> caused by a
transfer of any port of
his dominions

<pb n="155801"/>

without any notice whatever 
to the Treaty Powers.</p>

<p>The amount claimed
by Mess. Roper, <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co
is 5% drawback on $44,746.00
value of duty-paid goods
specially imported for-sale 
on the German Coast
and held by them in the
city of Zanzibar on the
1st of January 1891 say
$2,237.30, and in submitting
this claim to the Department 
I consider that we
have a clear case against
the Sultan through the
English Protectorate, and
trust that the Department
will endorse my opinion
and take proceedings
towards payment of the claim.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honour to receive
your communication of the
22d inst, informing me that
by order of the Imperial German
Government, the Ports of Tanga
Pangani, Saadani, Bagamoya,
<unclear>Jar es</unclear> Salaam, Kilwa, and Mickindani
only, on the German East African
Coast, would be open as Ports of

a large amount of goods
suitable only for trade with the
German Coast, which have paid
5% duty to the Zanzibar Customs.</p>

<p>These goods were imported
to Zanzibar in good faith that
the Sultan's dominions included
that portion of the Coast leased
to the German East African Co.
and by treaty are free to be sold
there without any other tax or
payment whatever.</p>

<p>No notice has been received
at this Consulate of any change
in the Government of the Coast
in question, other than is contained
in your note under advice, and
I beg to point out that, that note
gives but nine days notice to
disestablish customs of fifty years
standing.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that
no additional duty can legally
be levied on goods that have not

<p>US Consulate
Zanzibar, December 29th, 1890.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Understanding that you
have taken charge of the
Foreign Relations of H. H. the Sultan,
I have the honour to request that
you bring to the notice of His
Highness' Government the following</p>

<p>The American house of
Roper, <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co. hold in this
city, a quantity of goods on which
they have paid 5% duty to the
Zanzibar Customs. Under
existing treaties, one payment
of 5% admits goods free to all
ports and ports of the Sultan's
Dominions, and in good faith
under this treaty right, these
goods were imported from the
<catchwords>United States</catchwords>

Sir C B Euan Smith <unclear>K. C. B. C. S. A.</unclear>

<pb n="155900"/>

United States, especially for trade
in that portion of His Highness's
Dominions leased to the German
East African Company.</p>

<p>On the 22d inst, I received
notice from the German Consulate
that from January 1st 1891, duty
would be taken on the German
East African Coast for account
of the German Government, from
which I infer that some transfer
in the Coast Government has
been made although no notice
of any such transfer has been
received from anyone, at this
Consulate.</p>

<p>If this additional duty
is allowed to be levied on the
Coast at nine days notice, I am
of the opinion that a drawback
of 5% should be allowed by
H. H. the Sultan to Roper, <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co
on all duty-paid goods held
<catchwords>by them</catchwords>

<pb n="155914"/>

by them now in Zanzibar
and which can only find a
market on the German Coast,
or that some arrangement should
be made between H. H. the Sultan
and the German authorities, by
which these goods may be
imported free into the German
Coast within a reasonable time,
say six months.</p>

<p>I presume that, in the
future merchandise for the
German Coast via Zanzibar
may be transhipped in bond,
if, in the mean time, no more
favorable arrangement is made.</p>

<p>If commercial I should
be glad to receive the views of
His Highness' Government on
the foregoing, in time to transmit 
to my Government by the
European mail of the 2d port</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honour to
acknowledge receipt of your
letter dated the 29th inst. on the
subject of an intimation which
upon have received that after the
1st of January 1891, the German
Authorities will proceed to levy
<unclear extent="one word"/> duties upon the German
East African Coast Line on account
of the German Government.</p>

<p>You are of the opinion that
if these duties are to be levied on
goods already imported into
Zanzibar destined for import into
the German Coast Line and
which have already paid duty
<catchwords>to the</catchwords>

<pb n="160010"/>

Sultan under existing treaties,
a drawback of 5% should be
allowed by His Highness the
Sultan on all duty paid goods
held by American subjects.</p>

<p>You further ask for an expression 
of my opinion on the Representative
of the Protecting Power in
Zanzibar regarding the position
of merchandise that may be for
the future imported in Zanzibar
but destined for the German Coast.
Your enquire whether or not such
merchandise can be transhipped
in Bond until some more favourable
arrangement be made.</p>

<p>In reply I have to inform
you that questions exactly similar
to these which have been received
by you in your letter under reply
have naturally been submitted
to me by many British and
British Indian merchants

<p>The whole matter is
necessarily being submitted
by me for the consideration
of the Majesty's Government
upon whose advice the future
action of His Highness the Sultan
in regard thereto will necessarily
be regulated.</p>

<p>Pending the receipt of the 
reply that I may receive from
Her Majesty's Secretary of State

now addressing to him on this
subject, I regret that it is not
within my power to make any
statement that may serve as a
