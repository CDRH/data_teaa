<note>Department of State Received Dec 31 1888</note>

<p>St. Paul de Loanda</p>

<p>British Consulate Loanda<lb/>
15 November 1888.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>It is my painful duty to have to report to the
Department the death of Vice Consul Judson, who died 
here suddenly on the 8th inst. It would appear that
Mr. Judson went to the government office to get a
passport to go to Cabinda, and was seized with a fit
on the stairs. He was immediately put into a maxilla
and sent to his house which was close by. Dr. Oliveira
was called, and did all he could for him, but he died
almost before the medicine could be had from the Chemist.
Enclosed you will find certificate of death.</p>

<p>Immediately I heard of the occurrence, I went
to the Secretary who is at present acting Governor,
and requested him to allow me to take charge, and
as my appointment as Vice Consul for the United
States has not been officially advised to the Portuguese
Government as having been annulled, he said
he would not interfere. I therefore took charge of the
Funeral

funeral, inviting only the Consuls of the different Four
nations, and authorities. The funeral took place on the 
following morning at 7 oclock in the English Cemetery
the American missionary Mr. McLean reading the
Funeral service.</p>

<p>I have taken full charge of all his effects, and of the
Archives which I find are in a plate of the utmost
confusion, and I am therefore unable to send a proper
inventory of the same by this mail, but will do so by
first opportunity.</p>

<p>I shall be happy to continue in charge of this
Consulate should the Department wish me to do so</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Robt S. Newton<lb/>
HB Majesty's Acting Consul</p>

<p>Translation</p>

<p>José Baptista de Oliveira, Physician of the School of
Medicine &amp; Surgery of Lisbon &amp;c</p>

<p>I certify that Mr Judson, Consul for the United States of
America in this city, died suddenly of Congestion of the lungs
so suddenly that I did not have time to give him any
treatment.</p>

<p>In witness of the truth of which, I hereby sign<lb/>
(signed) José Baptista de Oliveira</p>

<p>Loanda 15 November 1888</p>
