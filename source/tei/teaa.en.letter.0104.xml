<p>Translation of Order No. 404
dated, 21st September 1876, issued
by the Colonial Government of the 
Province of Angola, and published
in the Official Gazette No. 39.
dated 23rd September 1876.</p>

<p>It being acknowledged
that the Coasting Trade, between
the Ports on the coast of any Country,
belong without exception to the National
flag, and it being equally a fact 
that the Crown of Portugal in the 
treaties concluded with the various
Foreign States, has not, as yet, relinquished 
this restrictive right.</p>

<p>Considering that, the navigation
between the Ports of the vast territory
of this Province whether it be occupied

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0104.002"/>

or, notwithstanding the indisputable
right of the sovereignty of the
nation, not occupied, ought in every 
way to be considered as Coasting
(Cabotagem), and as such must 
be exclusively carried on under the 
Portuguese flag:</p>

<p>Considering that at present, part
of the commerce between these ports is
being carried on by small vessels of 
different nationalities, through an 
abuse of toleration, which without 
rights being given them, or ours
being diminished, constitutes, nevertheless,
a certain usurpation of rights 
legally guaranteed to the Crown.</p>

<p>As it is important that the 
rules which govern navigation should
<catchwords>be</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0104.003"/>

be maintained in all their integrity
in their recognised forms, as a means
of avoiding confusion as to rights, and 
perhaps disputes.</p>

<p>With the unanimous vote of the
Colonial Government in Council and,
unless the Government of His Majesty,
The King ordains the contrary, I
have found it expedient to determine
the following:</p>

<p>>Article 1st. The Coasting Trade
between the Ports comprised within
the territory of this Province, occupied
or not, but which belong by right to
the Crown, is reserved exclusively
for the Portuguese Flag.</p>

<p>Article 2nd. Foreign Vessels which
are now trading between the Ports 
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0104.004"/>

of this Province, can continue in this
traffic, in order that they may liquidate
invested interests, during the space of 
six months counting from this date, on
the expiry of this period, this concession 
will cease. </p>

<p>Let the Authorities and others who
are interested take note and obey.</p>

<p>Palace of the Government in<lb/>
Loanda, 21st November 1876.</p>

<p>Signed<lb/>
Caetano Alexandre de Almeida e
Albuquerque.<lb/>
Governor General.</p>
