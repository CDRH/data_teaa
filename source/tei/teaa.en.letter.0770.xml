<p>No 103 ... U.S. Consulate Goree-Dakar<lb/>
April 30th 1889</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge receipt
of your Dispatch No 46 which came
to hand yesterday, and having a full
knowledge of Saint Louis affairs I have 
to report as follows.</p>

<p>Saint Louis is a flourishing City
of some 30,000 inhabitants, built mainly
in the European Style, and being situated
near the mouth of a large and navigable
River has considerable commerce with
the interior. Unfortunately this River
is obstructed at its mouth by a bar
which renders it usually not navigable
for vessels of large size, so that until
quite recently the place has been rather
avoided by vessels coming direct from 
the United States. Such vessels have

<pb n="20170619_144808"/>

mainly discharged their cargoes at
Goree from which place small
schooners, principally American, have
been employed to forward them as
wanted to selling-agents at Saint-Louis.
This American Coastwise Commerce
has averaged in the last decade to
60 or 75000 dollars a year and amounts
perhaps to nearly that now. The
Messrs F H Hamlen &amp; Son have attempted
to do business with Saint Louis direct,
and so far have been favored by
an unusually good condition of the
bar. A vessel chartered by them
called the Edith called here in March
1888 to have surveys held, having
damaged some of her cargo on the
passage out, and I presume that
the inconvenience of not having a
proper functionary there to attend to
American interests must be to them
very great. The reason I have 
not urged the matter with the 
Government is that in Dispatch
No 4 to this Consulate it was

<pb n="20170619_144813"/>

expressly stated that "no agencies
were then needed," and I have
received no encouragement to push
the matter since. The American
trade at Saint Louis is certainly
capable of being increased, and
if the Government is now disposed
to afford the facility of a Consular
Agent there I will make an 
early occasion to see Mr Camille
Larrouy, with whom I am not
yet personally acquainted, and
report in the course of a month
on his qualifications. A brother
of his has been President of the
Tribunal here at Goree, and as he
seems to be the trusted agent of
the American firm who have made
application for him, there can be no
question as to his character. The serious
trouble here is that no one seems
to realize that an American Consul
is required to speak and write in
English or that he has anything
in particular to do. Mr Larrouy

<pb n="20170619_144820"/>

is I believe a French West
Indian, many of whom know 
English very well, and I have
a pretty strong impression that
he will be found available.</p>

<p>Saint Louis is less than
one hundred miles from here in
a direct line, but about 140 miles
by train, and a trip there takes
an entire day. There are two
American vessels expected here
every moment, and having no
Vice Consul or Deputy at command
I cannot leave here for St Louis
until both of these vessels are cleared.
Goree-Dakar as I have pointed out
in several of my Dispatches is probably 
the most important commercial point
on the West African Coast, but its
Consulate cannot be kept on a proper
basis for lack of funds. I would
respectfully request that while the necessary
agency in question is being established
that measures be taken to place this 
Consulate on the same salary basis

<pb n="20170619_144825"/>

as that at Santiago C.V.I
and that at Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>I am Sir<lb/>
Very truly yours<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
U.S. Consel</p>
