<p>United States Commercial Agency at Gaboon,<lb/>
February 1st 1878.</p>

<p>Hon F W Seward,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
Dispatch No 11th, leaving date, October 24th 1877,
on the 18th of January 1878, almost three months from
the time it was written. Our mails during the past 
year, have been irregular, with an interval of from 
six to eight weeks, between them. The last steamer 
was just two months, from Liverpool, to Gaboon. The 
steamers, now having no government subsidy, call 
at numerous ports on the Coast, &amp; often are 
delayed for freight. There is a merchant steamer,
which will take these dispatches, that make much 
quicker passages, but it brings no mails.
This irregularity &amp; detention of our mails is my 
apology for asking for leave of <sic>absense</sic>, so long 
in advance. I doubt not the leave of <sic>absense</sic> has 
been granted; &amp;is in route for Gaboon; &amp; I hope it 
will be received by next steamer from Liverpool; 
which is due here on to the 21 inst. for the following
steamer will not arrive till about the 10th of April,

<pb n="20170615_143233"/>

and not return till May. Although I have 
nominated Rev. S. H. Murphy as vice 
Commercial Agent, &amp; doubt not his appointment 
has been made; I do not like to leave my post;
till I have received my leave of absence; &amp;
shall not, unless the state of my health 
<sic>imperitively</sic> demands it. My medical 
advisor, The French Surgeon in Chief of the
Colony, assured me this morning that my 
departure ought not be long postponed.</p>

<p>I beg to remain<lb/> 
Sir;<lb/>
Respectfully,<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant,<lb/> 
Albert Bushnell<lb/>
United S. Com. Agent</p>
