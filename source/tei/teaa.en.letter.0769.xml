<p>US Consulate, Goree-Dakar</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
George L Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>My attention has been drawn
lately to Bills which have been
drawn up with a view professedly to
reform the Consular service. Most
of these Bills, if not all, propose 
to increase the Salaries at some of
the Consulates, but no mention has
been made, so far as I know, of doing
anything for this Consulate. I beg
your attention then while I advance
some reasons for placing this Consulate,
as soon as may be, on a salary basis.</p>

<p>First. Many are already so which
seem comparatively of much less importance,
and it is also proposed to increase
the salaries at some of these. One Bill
I have seen published would give the Bathurst
(River Gambia) Consulate, where the Fees annually
are less than $45.00: fifteen hundred dollars:
another proposes twenty-five hundred for Sierra Leone

<pb n="20170619_143844"/>

where the Fees last year amounted to $114.50:
Santiago C.V.I. I have seen mentioned as
high as two thousand dollars, although the
fees collected from American vessels frequenting
all the Islands is possibly not much
greater in amount than here, and the
commerce there is vastly less important.
Probably all of the places before-mentioned
have not the capacity for American
Commerce which is embraced in this
Consular district, at least that is my
impression who have from time to time
done business in all of them.</p>

<p>At this westernmost point of Africa
in sight of which a large part of the 
commerce of Europe passes going southerly
we have one of the largest, cleanest, and
safest harbors in the world: as easy of
access by night as by day: no bar or
other obstruction to impede its entrance
and a <sic>debth</sic> of water sufficient for
vessels of any size. Three cities are
situated on different sides of this immense
natural harbor, two of which are connected
with the interior by a good Railroad
which has been in successful operation
for nearly four years through one hundred
and forty miles of extent. From twenty-<unclear>five</unclear>

<pb n="20170619_143849"/>

to forty steamers a month, according to the season of the year, afford Goree-Dakar ample
means of communication with Europe and
the outside world, and the mail and 
<sic>telegrapic</sic> facilities are excellent. Rufisque,
a city of about fifteen thousand inhabitants,
on the east side of the Bay of Goree and
within sight of the Consulate, is illuminated
by the electric light, and has a first-class
iron wharf in process of construction one
hundred and fifty metres in length. All 
of its principal streets are laid with
tramways, over which merchandise as well 
as passengers are transported, and nothing is
done in the primitive manner which was
so prevalent twenty years ago. Dakar is a 
new city with elegant buildings, wide streets
shaded with trees, and a large park which
would do honor to any city within the tropics.
Several war-vessels are almost constantly
anchored before the town, and the band
from the Admiral's ship plays in the 
Great Square quite often when the evenings
are pleasant and other circumstances are
favorable. Goree being a free port is
favorably situated for storing and transshipping
cargoes that are intended for other parts
of the coast, and consequently some of the

<pb n="20170619_143856"/>

largest firms in Senegal are here located.
By means of small steamers and schooners
goods received from Europe &amp; other parts are
distributed to all the small places between
the Great Desert and Sierra Leone, and
the produce which is received in payment
is brought here for transhipment in larger
vessels to Europe or to America. I am
not able to state the exact amount
of American trade with the French colors
of Senegal, but counting tobacco which
is received into all our ports by way
of Europe, and produce in payment
which goes back to America by way of
Europe. I am reasonably sure that <unclear>these</unclear>
figures would considerably exceed a
million of dollars annually, which figures
might also if we had more shipping and
a less protective duty on peanuts, be almost
indefinitely increased. See my Dispatch
to the Department No 28 of June 3d, 1885.</p>

<p>Much more might be said of 
the importance of Senegal to American
interests, but the foregoing remarks will
I trust be esteemed sufficient for what
I have in view, which is to show that
Senegal needs a Consulate established
on at least the low salary basis of

<pb n="20170619_143902"/>

one thousand dollars a year, with
perhaps an allowance of $300 more for 
Office Rent. Hitherto since I
received my appointment I believe
I have mentioned but once about
increasing the compensation, because
being well paid for looking after the
interests of a large American concern
I did not feel the need of it, and
my son also by giving me assistance
was learning the business. The decease
of my son has had some effect to
modify my views and feelings, but
I am also notified that owning to
age and infirmity the head of the 
firm I represent wishes an immediate
liquidation of his business here, which
in any case must reduce my income
to a very small amount indeed. It
is my intention that if the Government
will afford the salary I have named
to supplement it by a small American
business which will maintain me with
respectability, otherwise I may be compelled
to quit the coast, for at the age of
fifty I do not wish to take upon
me the organization of another large
mercantile concern, though if here I

<pb n="20170619_143908"/>

might assist others very essentially
with advice. But should the
Government not deem it expedient
to meet my need with a sufficient
salary, not only will my return to
America be in the near future
necessary, but the Government itself
will be driven to the alternative,
either of sending an unacclimated
inexperienced man out for the same
or a greater salary, or else the consulate
must be committed wholly to a
poorly qualified foreignor who
in the nature of things could
not be expected to burden himself
greatly with American interests.</p>

<p>I am esteemed Sir<lb/>
Very truly yours<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>
