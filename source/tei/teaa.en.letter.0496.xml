<p>United States Consulate,<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
February 14th, 1888.</p>

<p>To the President,
Your Excellency:</p>

<p>Although it is the
good fortune of the negroes in the United
States to be brought under the influence
of a people whose example is leading
them towards higher levels, a knowledge
of the peculiar conditions which surrounds 
their history, prevents the supposition 
that it is possible for them, at 
this early date, to have reached that
situation where they can, as a rule,
be independent of pecuniary reasons
for endeavor.</p>

<p>This being allowed
it becomes easy for me, without prejudicing 
myself, to enter into a relation
of circumstances surrounding my present
situation, from which I desire to be
relieved.</p>

<p><catchwords>The</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0496.004"/>

The public value which attaches 
to a Consulate is derived from many
sources, at some the duties are almost
only clerical, at others they become
judicial, at others diplomatic and,
so on until we touch that class
that find great, and important work in
laboring for the augmentation of our
foreign trade and this last mentioned
class is divided by the difference which
is between Consulates engaged in the enlargement 
of trade relations already
established and those whose duty it
is to open up new trade connections. The
opening up of new trade does not apply
only to those places where commerce 
already exists, but, also to those places
having a possible future commercial 
value.</p>

<p>That our growing industries
are finding new outlets in West Africa
the evidence of our exports, proves, but
these markets are open to improving cultivation 
and, under the case of Consuls
who are American Citizens, able, because
<catchwords>compensated,</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0496.005"/>

compensated, to confine themselves to
the performance of the duties of their
office, their value would soon be expressed 
in the most happy results.</p>

<p>Opposed to a Consul endangering 
his official usefulness and weakening
his influence or placing himself in a 
position preventing independent and 
unprejudiced action, by being engaged
in business, I took charge of this Consulate 
with the hope of being able to 
live upon my salary, but now after 
and in spite of every economy. I
find that it is impossible, and, unless
I can secure a larger income it will
be necessary for me to leave this service
of my country.</p>

<p>Recognizing an extended
field on this coast for the expressions
of such intelligent action as would
benefit our commercial interests, I
am anxious to remain. Familiar with
the commerce of my own country, its
industries and manufactures, I am
confident, if opportunity is given
<catchwords>me</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0496.006"/>

me to utilize the knowledge which
I have of Africa, its people and its 
trade, that I will be able to do
something towards, adding to our
foreign trade.</p>

<p>Because of the reasons as
before stated, I respectfully ask to
be transferred to Liberia as Consul
General, and I hope your Excellency,
that this request will meet with your
approbation and induce favorable
action in the premises.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Your Excellency,<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
Henry F. Downing</p>
