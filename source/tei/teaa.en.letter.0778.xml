<p>Subject</p>

<p>The interference of foreign
protective tariffs with American
Commerce</p>

<pb n="20170619_153914"/>

<note>No 189</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar<lb/>
November 18th 1895</p>

<p>Hon Edwin F Uhl<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir: In view of the late conquest
of the large and commercially important
Island of Madagascar by the French,
and the probability that when the
time is ripe for it the French Government will apply the same tariff regulations
to that country as they have done to
this, I have thought it fitting and 
proper to again call attention to the 
discriminating duty of seven per cent, 
which is levied by the Government
of this Colony, and I believe by the 
Governments of nearly all the French
Colonies, on all imported goods that
are not produced in France.</p>

<p>This tariff came into existence in
just three months after our own
Mc Kinley tariff began to take 
effect, and very quickly nearly

<pb n="20170619_153921"/>

extinguished nearly all that before remained
of direct American Commerce this way. The
rate would have been made even larger than
seven per cent, only it was feared that 
if it were then made larger the natives of the interior might by taking long
journeys communicate with the English
in their settlements on the Coast, and
thus defeat the intention of the aforesaid
protective tariff. The Coast of Madagascar
being all of it in the hands of the French
there would be in that region no such
competition to fear, and consequently
the conditions exist for nearly excluding
profitable American Commerce for the
future from the whole of that immense
Island, that is, unless the contrary
can soon be provided for by treaty.</p>

<p>I might further elucidate this
subject, but it is perhaps not
necessary</p>

<p>I am Sir<lb/>
Very truly yours<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>
