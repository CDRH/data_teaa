<note>Department of State Received Mar 29 1881</note>

<p>No. 48. U.S. Consulate at Sierra Leone Feb 21st 1881.</p>

<p>Judson A. Lewis - To Dept State</p>

<p>General Observations regarding
Commercial Relations.</p>

<pb n="607"/>

<p>No. 48. U.S. Consulate at<lb/>
Sierra Leone Feb. 21st 1881.</p>

<p>Hon John Hay<lb/>
Asst Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the
honor to address you at this
time regarding certain matters
bearing more or less upon trade
in this Colony and its dependencies.</p>

<p>I have received at
this Consulate numbers 1. and 2. 
October and November. "Commercial
Relations". and am glad to 
know that arrangements have
been made by the State Department
with Consular Officers for more
frequent Reports and <sic>provission</sic>
by Congress for the publishing
and distribution of the Same - 
<sic>beleiving</sic> that the result will have
a tendency to greatly extend the

<pb n="608"/>

the commerce of the United States.
I shall endeavor to keep the
Department advised from time
to time regarding all matters of
interest at this place.</p>

<p>We are
now in the midst of the dry 
or busy season, but the
universal testimony of Merchants
and Traders in Sierra Leone
and all the surrounding Rivers is
that trade is very dull, <unclear>unusually</unclear>
so for this season of the
year - trade does not "come
down" from interiorward.
The roads are blocked up
and one tribe or clan are not
permitted to pass through the
domains of any other.
Now this never ceasing cry
of war (I think usually bloodless)
is a great damage to trade
and a source of annoyance to 
all those who have produce
to bring down.</p>

<pb n="609"/>

<p>There are no manufactures
of any importance in Sierra
Leone - and Agricultural
industry is sadly neglected -
given entirely to trade - so
when the untutored native from
the interior is prevented from
coming to town, trade to a
great extent ceases and
the town proper is as dull
as a New England village
on Sunday - straightway
our occupation is gone.
The only remedy for this will
be to go to work and cultivate
the land.</p>

<p>The Colonial Government of
Sierra Leone has <sic>ceeded</sic> a 
large tract of land (2000 acres)
to Hon William Grant (native)
who is now making extensive
experiments <unclear extent="one word"/> - in growing
Sugar Cane, Cocoa, Cola Nuts
Ginger &amp;c - the sugar cane
grows well and the juice

<pb n="610"/>

the nature of contents, or <del>the</del>
number the packages and
have said numbers appear
on the Invoice - for when a
thousand different packages
are sent from half as many
merchants aboard a vessel
for a foreign port, its no
joke to be obliged to open
all the boxes before you can 
find a certain article for
which you may be in search,
it would also greatly facilitate
the passing of goods through
the various Custom Houses
abroad.</p>

<p>I remain Sir<lb/>
Most Respectfully
Your Obt Servt<lb/>
Judson A. Lewis<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>
