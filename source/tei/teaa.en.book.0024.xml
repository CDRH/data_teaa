<head type="sub">I. Their Basic Savagery</head>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room,</l>
<l>Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable,</l>
<l>Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table,</l>
<l rend="stage">A deep rolling bass.</l>
<l>Pounded on the table,</l>
<l>Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom,</l>
<l>Hard as they were able,</l>
<l>Boom, boom, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>,</l>
<l>With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom,</l>
<l>Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Then</hi> I had religion, <hi rend="smallcaps">Then</hi> I had a vision.</l>
<l>I could not turn from their revel in derision.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Then I saw the Congo, creeping through the black</hi>,</l>
<l rend="stage">More deliberate. Solemnly chanted.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Cutting through the forest with a golden track</hi>.</l>
<l>Then along that riverbank</l>
<l>A thousand miles</l>
<l>Tattooed cannibals danced in files;</l>
<l>Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song</l>
<l>And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong.</l>
<l rend="stage">A rapidly piling climax of speed and racket.</l>
<l>And "<hi rend="smallcaps">Blood</hi>" screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors,</l>
<l>"<hi rend="smallcaps">Blood</hi>" screamed the skull-faced, lean witch-doctors,</l>
<l>"Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle,</l>
<l>Harry the uplands,</l>
<l>Steal all the cattle,</l>
<l>Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle,</l>
<l>Bing.</l>
<l>Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>,"</l>
<l>A roaring, epic, rag-time tune</l>
<l rend="stage">With a philosophic pause.</l>
<l>From the mouth of the Congo</l>
<l>To the Mountains of the Moon.</l>
<l>Death is an Elephant,</l>
<l>Torch-eyed and horrible,</l>
<l rend="stage">Shrilly and with a heavily accented metre.</l>
<l>Foam-flanked and terrible.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>, steal the pygmies,</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>, kill the Arabs,</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>, kill the white men,</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Hoo, Hoo, Hoo.</hi></l>
<l>Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost</l>
<l rend="stage">Like the wind in the chimney.</l>
<l>Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host.</l>
<l>Hear how the demons chuckle and yell</l>
<l>Cutting his hands off, down in Hell.</l>
<l>Listen to the creepy proclamation,</l>
<l>Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation,</l>
<l>Blown past the white-ants' hill of clay,</l>
<l>Blown past the marsh where the butterflies play:&#8212;</l>
<l>"Be careful what you do,</l>
<l>Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo,</l>
<l rend="stage">All the o sounds very golden. Heavy accents very heavy. Light accents very light. Last line whispered.</l>
<l>And all of the other</l>
<l>Gods of the Congo,</l>
<l>Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you,</l>
<l>Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you,</l>
<l>Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you."</l>

<head type="sub">II. Their Irrepressible High Spirits</head>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>Wild crap-shooters with a whoop and a call</l>
<l rend="stage">Rather shrill and high.</l>
<l>Danced the juba in their gambling-hall</l>
<l>And laughed fit to kill, and shook the town,</l>
<l>And guyed the policemen and laughed them down</l>
<l>With a boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Then I saw the Congo, creeping through the black</hi>,</l>
<l rend="stage">Read exactly as in first section.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Cutting through the forest with a golden track</hi>.</l>
<l>A negro fairyland swung into view,</l>
<l rend="stage">Lay emphasis on the delicate ideas. Keep as light-footed as possible.</l>
<l>A minstrel river</l>
<l>Where dreams come true.</l>
<l>The ebony palace soared on high</l>
<l>Through the blossoming trees to the evening sky.</l>
<l>The inlaid porches and casements shone</l>
<l>With gold and ivory and elephant-bone.</l>
<l>And the black crowd laughed till their sides were sore</l>
<l>At the baboon butler in the agate door,</l>
<l>And the well-known tunes of the parrot band</l>
<l>That trilled on the bushes of that magic land.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>A troupe of skull-faced witch-men came</l>
<l rend="stage">With pomposity.</l>
<l>Through the agate doorway in suits of flame,</l>
<l>Yea, long-tailed coats with a gold-leaf crust</l>
<l>And hats that were covered with diamond-dust.</l>
<l>And the crowd in the court gave a whoop and a call</l>
<l>And danced the juba from wall to wall.</l>
<l>But the witch-men suddenly stilled the throng</l>
<l rend="stage">With a great deliberation and ghostliness.</l>
<l>With a stern cold glare, and a stern old song:&#8212;</l>
<l>"Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.". . .</l>
<l>Just then from the doorway, as fat as shotes,</l>
<l rend="stage">With overwhelming assurance, good cheer, and pomp.</l>
<l>Came the cake-walk princes in their long red coats,</l>
<l>Canes with a brilliant lacquer shine,</l>
<l>And tall silk hats that were red as wine.</l>
<l>And they pranced with their butterfly partners there,</l>
<l rend="stage">With growing speed and sharply marked dance-rhythm.</l>
<l>Coal-black maidens with pearls in their hair,</l>
<l>Knee-skirts trimmed with the jassamine sweet,</l>
<l>And bells on their ankles and little black-feet.</l>
<l>And the couples railed at the chant and the frown</l>
<l>Of the witch-men lean, and laughed them down.</l>
<l>(O rare was the revel, and well worth while</l>
<l>That made those glowering witch-men smile.)</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>The cake-walk royalty then began</l>
<l>To walk for a cake that was tall as a man</l>
<l>To the tune of "Boomlay, boomlay, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>,"</l>
<l>While the witch-men laughed, with a sinister air,</l>
<l rend="stage">With a touch of negro dialect, and as rapidly as possible toward the end.</l>
<l>And sang with the scalawags prancing there:&#8212;</l>
<l>"Walk with care, walk with care,</l>
<l>Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo,</l>
<l>And all of the other</l>
<l>Gods of the Congo,</l>
<l>Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.</l>
<l>Beware, beware, walk with care,</l>
<l>Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom.</l>
<l>Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom,</l>
<l>Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom,</l>
<l>Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay,</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>."</l>
<l>Oh rare was the revel, and well worth while</l>
<l rend="stage">Slow philosophic calm.</l>
<l>That made those glowering witch-men smile.</l>

<head type="sub">III. The Hope of their Religion</head>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>A good old negro in the slums of the town</l>
<l rend="stage">Heavy bass. With a literal imitation of camp-meeting racket, and trance.</l>
<l>Preached at a sister for her velvet gown.</l>
<l>Howled at a brother for his low-down ways,</l>
<l>His prowling, guzzling, sneak-thief days.</l>
<l>Beat on the Bible till he wore it out</l>
<l>Starting the jubilee revival shout.</l>
<l>And some had visions, as they stood on chairs,</l>
<l>And sang of Jacob, and the golden stairs,</l>
<l>And they all repented, a thousand strong</l>
<l>From their stupor and savagery and sin and wrong</l>
<l>And slammed with their hymn books till they shook the room</l>
<l>With "glory, glory, glory,"</l>
<l>And "Boom, boom, <hi rend="smallcaps">Boom</hi>."</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Then I saw the Congo, creeping through the black</hi>,</l>
<l rend="stage">Exactly as in the first section. Begin with terror and power, end with joy.</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">Cutting through the jungle with a golden track</hi>.</l>
<l>And the gray sky opened like a new-rent veil</l>
<l>And showed the apostles with their coats of mail.</l>
<l>In bright white steele they were seated round</l>
<l>And their fire-eyes watched where the Congo wound.</l>
<l>And the twelve Apostles, from their thrones on high</l>
<l>Thrilled all the forest with their heavenly cry:&#8212;</l>
<l>"Mumbo-Jumbo will die in the jungle;</l>
<l rend="stage">Sung to the tune of "Hark, ten thousand harps and voices".</l>
<l>Never again will he hoo-doo you,</l>
<l>Never again will he hoo-doo you."</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>Then along that river, a thousand miles</l>
<l rend="stage">With growing deliberation and joy.</l>
<l>The vine-snared trees fell down in files.</l>
<l>Pioneer angels cleared the way</l>
<l>For a Congo paradise, for babes at play,</l>
<l>For sacred capitals, for temples clean.</l>
<l>Gone were the skull-faced witch-men lean.</l>
<l>There, where the wild ghost-gods had wailed</l>
<l rend="stage">In a rather high key&#8212;as delicately as possible.</l>
<l>A million boats of the angels sailed</l>
<l>With oars of silver, and prows of blue</l>
<l>And silken pennants that the sun shone through.</l>
<l>'Twas a land transfigured, 'twas a new creation.</l>
<l>Oh, a singing wind swept the negro nation</l>
<l>And on through the backwoods clearing flew:&#8212;</l>
<l>"Mumbo-Jumbo is dead in the jungle.</l>
<l rend="stage">To the tune of "Hark, ten thousand harps and voices".</l>
<l>Never again will he hoo-doo you.</l>
<l>Never again will he hoo-doo you."</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poetry">
<l>Redeemed were the forests, the beasts and the men,</l>
<l>And only the vulture dared again</l>
<l>By the far, lone mountains of the moon</l>
<l>To cry, in the silence, the Congo tune:&#8212;</l>
<l>"Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you,</l>
<l rend="stage">Dying down into a penetrating, terrified whisper.</l>
<l>Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.</l>
<l>Mumbo... Jumbo... will... hoo-doo... you."</l>
</lg>

<note>This poem, particularly the third section, was suggested by an allusion
in a sermon by my pastor, F. W. Burnham, to the heroic life and death of
Ray Eldred. Eldred was a missionary of the Disciples of Christ who
perished while swimming a treacherous branch of the Congo. See "A Master
Builder on the Congo", by Andrew F. Hensey, published by Fleming H.
Revell.</note>
