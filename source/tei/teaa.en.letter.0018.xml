<p>United States Commercial Agency<lb/>
Loanda January 22 1861</p>

<p>Sir.</p>

<p>Herewith I enclose Returns
from this Commercial Agency for the Quarter
ending December 31 '60. The Journal Accounts
&amp; Certificate I have directed to the Treasury
Department &amp; have drawn on the Hon Secretary
of the Treasury for $219.12&#162; being Balance of
my Salary for that Quarter.</p>

<p>Under date of October 23rd I had
the honor of addressing you &amp; enclosing Relations
for the Quarter ending September 30 '60. The
Fever then prevailing here I am now pleased to
say, was of short duration &amp; did not affect the 
old residents much, being mostly confined to newcomers.</p>

<p>I have now to inform Your Honor that
your despatch of August 10th respecting the "disposition
made by the British Government of the
Africans captured from Slavers by the British
Navy", &amp; also as to the "disposition made by that
Government" of the officers &amp; crews of these Slavers
<catchwords>was</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon Lewis Cass<lb/>
Secretary of State.</fw>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0018.002"/>

was not received of this Agency 'till November, &amp;
as I could not send an answer in season for the
next session of Congress. I have delayed it 'till the
present time.</p>

<p>As regards the "disposition of the 
Africans", I cannot give you any reliable information,
but presuming you have sent the same circular to the
US Consuls at St Helena, Sierra Leone &amp; English
West Indies, they will be able to give such information
to the Department as is now required.</p>

<p>Respecting the "disposition of officers &amp; crews
of Slavers", I have to inform your Honor that when 
a suspected vessel is boarded by the English, such inducements
&amp; threats as given that the Master suspects
more is known of him then in fact really is, which
generally leads to the giving up the vessel, when the
officers have their choice of giving to St Helena or
Sierra Leone, or being landed at some convenient
place on the Coast. The Crews nine times out
of ten are put on shore immediately. If they are
fortunate enough to be landed near the Congo River
they can find friends among the Traders there, who
keep them 'till an opportunity offers of Shipping, when
they take this chance again. but many have been 
left in desolate parts of the Coasts &amp; if they escaped 
being killed or robbed by the passing tribes they have

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0018.003"/>

generally died of African fever or hunger.
Although it sometimes happens that one or two Americans 
are found among the crews of these vessels, yet
generally they are comprised of Portuguese &amp; Spaniards.</p>

<p>Your despatch of November 7th informing me
that "some Consular forms &amp; a Boat flag have been
sent to my address" is received. The vessel being 
the above is now in port &amp; on receipt of the package 
I am in hopes to find that instead of a "Boat flag"
I shall find one for the "Consulate flag staff," that
being what I requested in my despatch No 10 under
date Sept 15th.</p>

<p>The Portuguese have again been
fighting with the Natives North of this, burning
several Towns &amp;c. but as the Towns are built of Mud
&amp; Straw, the damage done did not amount to much,
except helping draw rather largely on the Angola
Treasury, which is &amp; has been for a long time in a 
very <sic>undesireable</sic> condition.</p>

<p>Very Respectfully<lb/>
Your Obt Servt<lb/>
John G. Willis</p>
