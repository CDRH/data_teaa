<p>Opening to Civilization.&#8212;Mr. Wm. Coppinger, Secretary of the American Colonization Society, in his third annual statement, well says:</p>

<p>"There has never been a more intense and concentrated effort to open a continent than is now directed towards Africa. From Algeria, from Egypt, from Zanzibar, from the mouth of the Zambesi, from Natal, from Cape Colony, from Benguela, via Bihe, from the Congo and Ogove, the Niger, the St. Paul's, the Gambia and the Senegal, the influences of exploration, commerce, missionary and colonization endeavor are penetrating the vast interior with so much energy and success that, with whatever difficulties and obstacles, the result cannot be doubtful. A few years will give access to the immense and varied treasures of a magnificent quarter of the globe and bring its mighty domain under the sway of Christian civilization."</p>

<p>Mr. Coppinger recognizes the energetic efforts of the French in connecting the upper waters of the Niger with Senegal by railway; their project, still urged, for building a railway across the desert from Algeria to Timbuctoo, and flooding parts of the desert; and speaks of the rapid growth of French interests and influence in the African States bordering on the Mediterranean; and of their bill before the Chamber of Deputies for creating an African army of 58 battalions, 301 companies of infantry, 75 squadrons of cavalry, and 13 batteries of artillery, with 90 guns, besides the engineer and transport services.</p>

<p>The Portuguese, too, are <sic>deveveloping</sic> fresh activity, establishing prominent stations in all their African possessions, each with a military commander, having a staff composed of a surgeon, chaplain, and a dozen or more carpenters, masons, farmers and other master workmen&#8212;the first of these stations to be at Bihé, the point chosen for the Mission of the A. B. C. F. M. The government of Portugal has contracted for a packet service between Lisbon and Massamedes, the steamer to call at the intervening ports along the West coast of Africa. The Italian government, too, is alive to African interests, aiming to secure amicable relations with King John, of Abyssinia.</p>
