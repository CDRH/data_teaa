<note>Department of State Received Mar 2 1891</note>

<note>Number 128</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar<lb/>
January 31st, 1891</p>

<p>Mr Peter Strickland<lb/>
To the Department of State</p>

<p>Subject</p>

<p><sic>Imbrobability</sic> of being able to
find a suitable person to serve as
Vice-Consul or Deputy at this Consulate
on the present "Salary by Fees":&#8212;Also.&#8212;
The inability of the Consul to at present
supplement his "Salary by Fees" by doing a
paying Commission business: this being
caused principally by an increase of duties
here on foreign merchandise which came into
effect at the commencement of this month: these
and other considerations herein mentioned being
respectfully urged as reasons why this Consulate
should be put at once in a salary basis.</p>

<pb n="20170619_150359"/>

<note>Number 128</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar<lb/>
January 31st 1891</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
William F Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>In my Dispatch to the Department
No 123, and also in some of my other 
Dispatches. I have had the honor to
suggest that the Fees collected at this 
Consulate afford but a meagre compensation
for the services which actually have to
be rendered, and as experience has proved,
they do not make it possible that the
Consular business can be conducted
uninterruptedly and efficiently, as would
seem to be desirable in a colony which
in so short a time has become so
important as this.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years since there was 
not a single steamer trading here, and
a small sailing vessel required more than three
weeks to discharge and load. Now there are
four regular lines of steamers from France,
three from England, two from Germany,
and a multitude belonging to French

<pb n="20170619_150406"/>

mercantile firms which are nearly regular
on their trips, besides the usual complement
of transients and sailing vessels.
Altogether, I judge we are now having
not less than fifty steamers a month
some of which exceed 6000 tons in
size, their equipments being of the
finest description.</p>

<p>But twice now within two years
I have been obliged to close the Consulate
for months, because for the present allowance
"Salary by Fees" not even a foreigner could
be found willing to serve as Vice-Consul
and be subject to the
Regulations which our service imposes.
Several American Vessels "arrived and
departed" during my enforced absence
one of which having cargo damaged
needed very important Consular service
but there was no one on hand to
render them. Even now that the Consul
is open for business, and four American
vessels are known to be on their way <unclear>here</unclear>
there is neither Vice-Consul nor Deputy
to serve in case the Consul from sickness
or any other cause should not be able
This seems a state of affairs which
call for a sufficient remedy.</p>

<pb n="20170619_150413"/>

<p>But there are reasons more potent
perhaps than the foregoing why something
should be done immediately for this
Consulate.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have occasionally pointed
out the growing importance of the trade
relations between the manufacturers and
shippers of the United States and the
millions of appreciative consumers who
inhabit this country. with a suggestion
now and then that it might be well
for all interested in increase the importance
of this Consulate in at least a corresponding
ratio. But until no I have been 
under no necessity of regarding the
Consulate as a <sic>Scource</sic> of income,
and perhaps I never should if the
French Government had not lately adopted
measures which will give American
trade here for the moment a set-back,
and stop me I am afraid from
prosecuting with advantage my commission
business. I allude to the augmentation of the
duties here on the Goods of foreigners, which
will be mentioned more at length in
another Dispatch.</p>

<p>These duties if continued will check
importations from foreign countries

<pb n="20170619_150418"/>

considerably, and should the same
policy be pursued by the several
European nations among which the
greater part of Africa is now divided up
American Commerce on this Continent
will not have so promising a future
as it otherwise might have. It would
seem then that this state of affairs
should be closely watched, so that 
instead of diminishing the importance
of the Consulate, these very measures,
if persisted in, will all the more call
for its continuance, and by some <unclear>one</unclear>
capable of making the requisite observations.</p>

<p>But if the Consulate affords no
adequate salary how can this long be 
done? With no business to depend on
for an income, a family at home
and not fees enough from the diminished
number of vessels which will now perhaps
be coming here to pay my rent, there
can be but one course for me to
pursue in case I do not get timely
assistance. I shall be compelled to
close up and go home.</p>

<p>If the Government however can interfere
in season with a salary to prevent this

<pb n="20170619_150425"/>

I suppose I can say without egotism
that if education and experience avail
anything I ought not to be ill-qualified
for a more advanced Consular position.
I have served here now for more than
seven years with scarce a criticism from
any quarter against my work. I am 
in good health, thoroughly acclimated,
and know all the principal merchants
and of their wants in the American
line of trade between the Great Desert
and Sierra Leone, a distance of more 
than 600 miles. Hitherto I have not
done much in the way of giving in
reports which might be useful and
interesting to Americans, because,
without a salary and being occupied
with the care of a large mercantile
business, I could not compass means
to attend to it. But with suitable
compensation from the Government, I
could now give information which
would be of the utmost value to
all desiring an outlet for Goods this
way, and communicate with such
specially when they desired it. It 
will be understood that the new
duties cannot very long check here

<pb n="20170619_150432"/>

the importation of such American
staples as Lumber, Petroleum, and Tobacco
because these and many other articles
which Americans have cannot be furnished
by France. Also, those Articles in the 
manufacture of which Americans greatly
excel, it is not to be supposed that
the present discriminating duty of
seven per cent will prevent them from
being imported. But American manufacture
will require information on this and
kindred subjects which is at once
accurate and practical, and such
information if situated so I could
I should always be able and glad
to furnish.</p>

<p>Hitherto in making suggestions for
increased compensation I have only
named for a salary the highest sum
which would allow the consul to <unclear extent="one word"/>
business. But in view of the explanations
which have been made it may rightfully
enough be thought best to place
the Consulate on a basis which will
enable the Consul respectably and
without such extra assistance to <unclear>devalue</unclear>
his whole time to the interests depending
on the consulate. Almost

<pb n="20170619_150444"/>

every mail brings me communications
from America like the one enclosed,
and if employed in business other than
Consular I could not of course give
them the attention they seem to deserve.
Large quantities of American lard have
been sold where by American firms
which ave run sailing vessels in 
this direction, but this method of
doing business seems to be more and more
going out of use, and how can 
parties like the one mentioned in
the enclosure get the information
they want unless it is furnished
by their Consuls?</p>

<p>Consulates at points like this are
it is true a tax to the Government,
but if conducted in a manner to
furnish outlets for large quantities
of American Goods, they thereby make
possible the imports from which the
Government gains its principal pecuniary
support.</p>

<p>In a place like this which furnishes
neither unofficial fees nor other
perquisites and where rents and
the cost of living are dear, the
largest salary which allows to do business

<pb n="20170619_150451"/>

would better compensate a Consul
than anything less than $2500 with
business interdicted.</p>

<p>I hope my somewhat extended
remarks on the subject I am 
presenting will not be deemed amiss
by the  Department, as it seems
necessary that the situation now
existing should be stated somewhat
fully as well as frankly and fairly
in order to be duly appreciated.
With the facts thus furnished it 
will be the province of the Government
to decide what under the circumstances
should be done, and my suggestions 
are only intended to assist in making
up the judgment, the same as the 
testimony of an eye-witness would
assist in the operations of a court.
And perhaps I should further suggest
that as I am not long at my post
after a "Leave of Absence", if the
Government should now adopt the
seemingly necessary means to keep me here. I
should not probably care for another in <unclear>less</unclear>
than a year and a half. I have moreover
the best adapted premises in the Colony
for a Consulate, and everything which

<pb n="20170619_150457"/>

has thus far been furnished me is 
in good condition.</p>

<p>Should the Government decide
in accordance with my views, or otherwise, <unclear extent="one word"/>
us at present situated it is of the
utmost importance that I should
know the purport of the decision
promptly. I am at present not
meeting my expenses, and if it is
not asking too much I would
respectfully suggest telegraphing as
a means of giving the desired
information, the only address
necessary being, Strickland, Goree.</p>

<p>I am Sir<lb/>
Very respectfully Yours<lb/>
Peter Strickland<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>
