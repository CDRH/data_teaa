<p>Mr. R. Dorsey Mohun<lb/>
To the Department of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Return to Pool from Kassai
River.</p>

<p>Abstract of Contents.</p>

<p>Visit to Lake Leopold II &amp;e the 
Loukenye River.</p>

<p>Commercial Agency of the United States,<lb/>
Stanley Pool, Dec. 23rd 1892</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you
that I have just arrived here
from the <unclear extent="one word"/> <unclear>waters</unclear> of the 
Loukenye River, and shall
leave next week for the 
Sankourou &amp; Kassai Rivers.
The country any great distance
back from the river banks it
is hardly possible to see on
account of the hostility of the
natives, and now that the Mauyema
people (commonly called "Arabs") have
declared a general war against
all whites traveling without
a large escort is most dangerous.</p>

<p>To illustrate: November 23d 
<catchwords>I</catchwords>
    
<pb n="20170614_143408"/>

was some 375 miles up the 
Loukenye slipping was a village
called <unclear>Maiyeaye</unclear>. I desired to see
the natives making cloth &amp; asked
permission of the Chief to visit
the town, which was readily
granted. I only took six men
with me armed with revolvers
under their shirts. When I had
gotten about six minutes distance 
from the town, I was most
foully attacked from the bush 
with spears &amp; poisoned arrows.
Fortunately none of my men were
struck, and before they could 
throw their arrows again we had
opened fire, &amp; drove the natives
ahead. We captured the village
and I burned it to the ground 
to teach them a lesson. The 
next day the Chief sent me some 
goats &amp; desired to make blood
brotherhood, &amp; declare peace, which 
I was more than gland to grant
This is only one of the five
<catchwords>or</catchwords>
  
<pb n="20170614_143416"/>

or 
six times I have been compelled to 
fight during the past few months.
If my report, when sent to the Department 
does not seem to comprehend 
the whole of the Kongo
State, it will be because I have
not enough of a force to penetrate 
to those parts.</p>
    
<p>The whole Eastern boundary of
the state is now shut by the 
Arabs, and all the white men who 
were in the different ports have 
been killed. Their bodies were 
afterwords eaten by the large
number of cannibal slaves attached
to the caravans.</p>

<p>So far my health has been 
good.</p>

<p>I am sir,<lb/>
Very respectfully<lb/>
Your obedient Servant<lb/>
R. Dorsey Mohun<lb/>
Commercial Agent</p>
