<note>Department of State Received Dec 22 1884</note>

<p>U.S. Commercial Agency<lb/>
at Gaboon, West Africa.<lb/>
Nov 6th 1884</p>

<p>Honorable John Davis, Assistant 
Secretary of State:</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I now report my 
arrival at my station Oct. 22nd
1884 and my entry upon the duties 
of the office at that date. I found 
everything pertaining to the office 
had been carefully cared for by Rev.
A. C. Good who was appointed to V.C.A.
but who, owing to certain expected
changes in our mission, thought it 
not best to qualify as he might not 
be able to attend to the duties of the 
office. There has therefore been no 
official duties performed and the 
regular reports have not been sent.</p> 

<p>I have made an official 
call upon the Commandant and 
have received his in return; during
which calls I have been able to gather 

<pb n="20170615_145443"/>

gather some facts regarding the 
policy of France in this colony.</p>

<p>The present Commandant so 
friendly, personally, but insists upon 
the laws being explored even while 
he expresses regret that such laws should 
have been passed</p>

<p>Benita a district, North of 
Gaboon where our mission has been 
laboring nearly Thirty years with marked
success has lately been claimed both 
by the Germans and the French, the 
natives favoring the Germans. The 
Commandant here has received orders
from France to close the mission schools 
there even before the claim of ownership 
is allowed.</p>

<p>The French have wished to get 
possession of Corisco Island now 
belonging to Spain, where our mission 
has been established for nearly Forty 
years and the Commandant wrote to 
the people asking them to favor the 
transfer from Spain to France. The 
people met, and expressed their

<pb n="20170615_145449"/> 

wishes by letter written by one of our
native preachers, Rev. Ibea L. <unclear>Kinge</unclear> a native 
of Corsico, in language more <sic>forceable</sic>
than elegant and now the Commandant 
threatens to arrest and imprison
him if he enters the Colony of Gaboon.
He however expects to attend our meeting
of Presbytery in Jan. next.</p>

<p>Towards the people here, they are 
acting so as gradually to divest<del>ing</del> them of all power,
occasionally using very arbitrary measures 
and rejoicing that they are able to show the
people that resistance is useless.</p>

<p>There are various political intrigues
reported, but I cannot at this
writing, vouch for their truthfulness.</p>
    
<p>I feel that the next few years 
is going to decide the question, whether
France is to be allowed to impose her
unjust laws and arbitrary restrictions 
upon a large part of tropical Africa,
or not; and I could wish that the 
voice of our own Government might 
be heard protesting effectively in behalf
of this down trodden people.</p>

<pb n="20170615_145458"/>
 
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of a copy of an act making 
appropriations for the consular and 
Diplomatic service of the government for 
the fiscal year ending June thirteenth
eighteen hundred and eighty five, and 
for other purposes.</p>
    
<p>I transmit herewith reports
No<del>s</del>. 100 <del>&amp; 101</del> for Quarter ending 
June 30th 1883 and No 105 for fiscal
years ending respectively June 30th, 1883-1884.</p>

<p>I remain Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Graham C. Campbell<lb/>
U.S.C.A</p>
