<p>U.S. Consulate at
Sierra Leone April 17th 1879</p>

<p>To
F. W. Seward<lb/> 
Assistant Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge 
the receipt of your Dispatch No 10 
with enclosures <sic>refering</sic> to the matter 
of Capt O'Brien of the American 
Brig "Annie &amp; Lily" &amp;c</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that I cannot 
confirm Capt O'Brien's statement 
throughout. He did not come to my 
<sic>Apothicary</sic> shop &amp; asked for his papers, 
he, on his way to his consignees, between 
7 &amp; 8 O'clock A.M., in passing my 
shop, <sic>stoped</sic> and informed me that 
he would that day go to sea.</p>

<p>I knowing that he could not clear 
from the Custom house before 10 Oclock,
and that his object was that I should 
<catchwords>get</catchwords>

<pb n="341"/> 

get his papers ready. I asked him at 
what time would he be ready to <sic>recieve</sic> 
the two seamen on board? He replied 
he would rather see the men at my 
office that I might give them orders 
that they were to work, as Consul's men 
were disposed to <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; spoil the crew, 
&amp; when told to do any thing they would 
refuse". I accordingly sent for the men. 
Capt O'Brien returned about 12 Oclock 
M, saw the men at my office, and 
"refused to take them, saying they 
were too sick to do anything on 
board of his ship." I admit they 
were a little sick, as they come to this 
Consulate under the effects of Fever, 
but were able each day to walk 
to my office the distance of a quarter 
of a mile, when they wish to do so: 
My experience of nine years in the 
treatment of the African or Coast fever 
(4 years as Chief Physician in the American 
Colonization Hospital or <unclear extent="one word"/> in 
Liberia, &amp; 5 years private practice 
on the coast.) was sufficient for me 
<catchwords>to</catchwords> 

<pb n="342"/>

have concluded that a few days at sea would set-them right, as I have frequently sent patients suffering with African fever, to sea, with good results.</p>

<p>Capt O'Brien after refusing to take 
them, asked for his papers, which I 
refused to give unless he consented to 
take them or give a written reason; 
this he also refused to do.</p>

<p>In his fit of exasperation he said that 
"the American laws governing American 
Merchant vessels were a swindle, &amp; 
that it was a disgrace now a days to 
sail under that Flag; he would 
rather give one dollar to pay for 
each sailor's coffin than to be bothered 
with them." or words to this intent. 
This took place at the Consulate and 
not in my medical office.</p>

<p>Capt O'Brien left, and in a short 
time after, the correspondence I sent 
in my Dispatch No 3 passed between us. 
At 8 the next morning Capt O'Brien 
called at this Consulate and asked to 
be directed to the seamen's boarding 
<catchwords>house</catchwords> 

<pb n="343"/>

house as he wished to take Dr Smith 
to see the men for the purpose of getting 
a certificate" I sent a boy to shew him 
their place, But he did not take Dr 
Smith as he should have done; but 
went to the house himself, &amp; finding 
one of the men in bed with a chill, 
insisted on their going to the Doctor 
to be examined. they refused, saying
they were too sick to do so. Capt O'Brien 
then informed me that the men 
had themselves <sic>admited</sic> that they 
were too sick to go to sea. I went 
to their room and <sic>aske</sic> them had they 
made such a statement &amp; they said 
"Yes." I then told the Capt that he could 
have his papers, &amp; they were delivered 
to him that afternoon, as he had to 
present his clearance from the Custom 
house first, which he did not do 
until pm. As regards the statement 
made by Mrs J Gray, I believe it to be 
true, &amp; I am sorry she is too sick to 
enable me to obtain a written statement 
from her properly authenticated. 

<pb n="344"/>

I do not believe Capt O'Brien wanted 
to take the men on board of his vessel, &amp; 
after shewing so much annoyance at 
being compelled to do so; I think the 
men were afraid to go with him 
particularly "Henry Miller, who said 
he knew him to be a bad man at 
sea" Capt O'Brien could have obtained 
(through his consignees) a certificate 
from Dr Smith, worded just as he 
wished it, I think most every one in 
town will admit this.</p>

<p>As regards the Capts remarks about my 
not being a regular Physician; I am 
quite sue he can get all the information 
he desires on that subject by referring 
to the records of Harvard Medical 
School Boston Mass, or Dartmouth
College N.H.</p>

<p>Had these men been affected with 
a <sic>contageous</sic> disease, I would not 
have asked the Capt to take them.
But they were not thus affected, and in 
proof of this I inclose correspondence 
between the Colonial Surgeon, Dr Smith 
<catchwords>and</catchwords> 

<pb n="345"/>

and myself on the subject. I beg to 
say in conclusion that the men 
were not too sick to go on board 
on the 21st Oct: for the distance 
from their boarding place to the <sic>warf</sic> 
is much shorter, than the distance 
to the Hospital, to which place they 
walked on the 23rd when they were 
admitted: the day Capt O'Brien 
sailed. I have no complaint to 
make of Capt O'Brien's private conduct; 
but as Capt of an American ship, in 
this particular case his actions were 
very <sic>inhumain</sic>: And as I have 
adopted the policy to inform the 
Department of all that occurs in 
this Consulate during my incumbency, 
I felt it my duty to state the facts 
in his case just as they <sic>occured</sic></p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your Obt Servant<lb/>
John A Parm, U.S. Consul</p>
