<p>Consulate of the United States,
at St. Paul de Loanda, Sept 1st, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform you
that I arrived at my post yesterday
Aug. 31st by S.S. "Ambaca" exactly 
62 days after sailing from New 
York and that I have taken charge
of this Consulate to-day.</p>

<p>The Governor General of Angola had
already announced my appointment
and permission to act in the official
Bulletin of Aug. 22d.</p>

<p>The archives of the Consulate were transferred 
to me by Vice-Consul Ed. Bannister, 
and we have together made the
enclosed Inventory of the same according 
to the directions contained in the Consular 
Regulations.</p>

<p>Pending the choice of a definite location

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0564.003"/>

I have taken a temporary office at
the house of a reliable friend. The 
partition in Mr. Newton's office, which
was formerly used for the U.S. Consulate
I found already occupied by the British
Consulate.</p>

<p>I also have to advise my drafts
on the Hon. Secretary of the Treasury,
one of the $82.90, for the period of instructions 
and another of $136.99, for my
transit, both in <unclear extent="on word"/> of Bywater, Tanqueray &amp; Phayre Ld. 17 Broadway, New York.
As you already know, it was
not possible for me to reach my
destination within the determined
50 days, nor have my predecessor, that
I know of, been able to do so.</p>

<p>In spite of two years of drought and
consequent scarcity of food, I find Loanda
much improved and commerce flourishing
This is due to the railroad and the 
good prices fetched by native produce.</p>

<p>The political crisis is becoming so
acute, that a joint movement of Portuguese 
and natives for Angolan independence 
is imminent, nor is it probable 
that the Lisbon government would

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0564.004"/>

or could seriously oppose such a
change. In a great meeting,
the leading man of Loanda, irrespective 
of party or color, have protested 
against the cession of the Lunda
to the Congo State, and resolved to
frustrate the permission given the
same State to contract 500 natives
in Angola. And they have done
it so effectually that the Congo State
Agent has withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Department shall soon hear
more on these subjects.</p>

<p>As, to my knowledge, there
is no American Consul on the Congo,
I take the liberty to inform the
Department of the decease at Vivi,
on the 12th Aug. of Christian
Borella a native of Denmark
and naturalized American citizen.</p>

<p>After a long career of usefulness
in and out of the employ of the
New York Seamen's Missionary 
Society, Borella sailed about
three years ago, for Liberia. Fever-worn

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0564.005"/>

he took a trip to Cape-Town,
and thence came to Loanda, whence
he went to the inland stations of
Bishop Taylor's Mission. He was 
appointed Captain of Bishop Taylor's
steamer on the Lower Congo, and
went there, though debilitated.
On Aug. 10th he was seized by 
haematuric fever, and on the 12th following, 
at 4 a.m., he breathed his
last. Bishop Taylor was with him
on Vivi hill, and nursed him; but
in vain.</p>

<p>Living and traveling at his own
expense, full of love to all men,
humble, studious and hardworking,
Christian Borella was cherished
wherever he went, his death and will be
lamented by many,in Africa as
well as in New-York.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be, Sir,<lb/>
Your most obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Comml Agent</p>

<p>Hon. William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary <lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Form No. 5</p>

<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
at St. Paul de Loanda,<lb/>
Sept. 1st, 1891</p>

<p>We certify, on this the first
day of September 1891, the services
of Ed: Bannister ceased, and
he entitled to his salary, or fees,
including said day; and that
the services of Heli Chatelain commenced

received the archives, a full and
complete inventory of which is hereto
annexed, as required by the Consular
Regulations Article VIII.</p>
