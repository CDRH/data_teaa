<p>No. 28.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States<lb/>

<p>No. 28.</p>

<p>Consulate General of the United States.<lb/>
Monrovia, Liberia 23rd Aug. 1877.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honor to inform the Department that during the months of Mar. or April I addressed a note to Mr. H. L. Crusoe, in his capacity of Commercial Agent of the United States, at Grand Bassa, in which I requested that gentleman to spare for my use whenever it is necessary for me to travel by row-boat, one of the
<catchwords>small</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Honorable<lb/>
F. W. Seward<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>

<pb n="Roll3-1149.jpg"/>

small American Flags belonging to the Commercial Agency at that point.</p>

<p>A copy of Mr. Crusoe's reply to me, in which that gentleman informs me that he has resigned the office of Commercial Agent of the United States, and given the Archives of the Agency into the possession of Mr. Cheeseman, is transmitted herewith, marked Enclosure No. 1.</p>

<p>I wrote to Mr. Crusoe the second time, requesting him to explain, for my information, the circumstances of his resignation as mentioned by himself in Enclosure No. 1. of this despatch. After waiting in vain a reasonable time for an <sic>explination</sic> 
<catchwords>from</catchwords> 

<pb n="Roll3-1150.jpg"/>

from Mr. Crusoe, I addressed a note of inquiry to Mr. Cheeseman. That note was dated 16 July and a copy thereof is enclosed (marked No. 2.) and transmitted herewith.</p>

<p>Not having received a reply from Mr. Crusoe nor from Mr. Cheeseman up to the present time of writing, I regard it my duty to visit Bassa and, in person investigate the circumstances. Hence I shall go thither, the interests of the Government permitting thereof, by the first conveyance leaving Monrovia for that point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I shall hope to have the honor to thank the Department for whatever information or instruction that is proper to be extended 
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

to me in the matter.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Sir;</p>

<p>Honorable H. L. Crusoe informed me a few days since that he has resigned the office of United States Commercial Agent of Grand Bassa, and that you are in charge of the Archives, and I suppose acting incumbent of that position.
