<p>Department of State<lb/>
Monrovia, October 3 1864</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>In consequence of
certain dangers with
which this Republic is
suddenly threatened by
the recent stranding of
our only naval vessel and
guarda costa, the "Quail"
and the probability of
our coast being, for a
long time, in an exposed
and defenceless conditions,
<catchwords>I</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon. W. H. Seward<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
&amp;c &amp;c
Washington D.C.</fw>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.002"/>

I am directed by the
President to make
application through
you to the Government
of the United States
for a small revenue
cutter or gun-boat
for which this Republic
will stipulate to pay
after a term of years to
be agreed upon by the
Chargè d'Affaires of
Liberia in the United
States, and whomsoever
the United States
Government may appoint
as its agent to negotiate
on its behalf</p>

<p><catchwords>Among</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.003"/>

Among the dangers to be
apprehended are, 1st the
invasion of our feeble
settlements on the coast
at a distance from the 
capital by predatory tribes
who, taking advantage
of the emergency the
absence of a suitable
vessel to throw forces
readily among them
would seek the slightest
pretext for plundering the
settlements.</p>

<p>Owing ton the influence
destructive of the slave
trade, which this
Republic has exercised,
<catchwords>not</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.004"/>

not a few of the older
aborigines who formerly
enriched themselves by
the nefarious traffic
entertain bitter and
resentful feelings against
Liberia, which, whenever there
is the least opportunity,
they never fail to
manifest. The younger
natives, I am happy to
perceive the superior
advantages of lawful
commerce over the slave
trade, and we may
hope that ere long not
only the overt practice
but every feeling favorable
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.005"/>

to it will be completely
annihilated within our
borders.</p>

<p>2 From what I have
just said, it may be
readily inferred that
another danger to the
Republic likely to result
from the absence of a
guarda costa would be
the revival of the slave
trade in isolated
localities. Those sections
of country would again
be the scene of the
horrible barbarities and
cruelties of former years,
and a deplorable check
<catchwords>would</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.006"/>

would be imposed
upon the growing
agriculture and
commerce of the country.</p>

<p>3 The third and last
danger, which I shall 
mention, to be apprehended
by us from the naval
deficiency in question
would be the constant
infraction of our
revenue laws by certain
European traders;
especially as there will 
likely go into operation
on the 1st of January
1865, our new law
confirming all foreign
vessels to the legally
constituted "ports of entry."
<catchwords>Many</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.007"/>

Many of the European
traders seem opposed to
this law, not because it is
not just and equitable,
but because they think
that their traffic hereafter
will not be so lucrative as
it has been; and, through
their influence, by
clandestine visits to
native tribes on the coast,
they would be able to excite
and aid them to acts of
hostility against the
Government.</p>

<p>The Government of
Liberia has never before
felt at liberty to make 
application, in emergencies,
<catchwords>to</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.008"/>

to the Government of the
United States. But such
has been the kind and
courteous treatment of
the present Government to
Liberia, that we feel
emboldened to take this
step, assured that we
have your ardent
sympathy in our efforts
to build up and maintain
an independent
Afric-American
nationality on this
continent.</p>

<p>The President and
people of Liberia have
observed with emotions of
sincere pleasure the
enlightened patriotism
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.009"/>

and exalted philanthropy
which, since the breaking
out of the unhappy contest,
have influenced the councils
of the American nation.
Among the decisions of
that Government which
Liberia and every negro
community must hail
with the most unfounded
applause, are first, the
decision that slavery shall 
not hence forth be extended
under the American flag
over territories now free;
secondly, that the African
slave trade shall never be 
revived or renewed; thirdly,
that slavery shall be
forever abolished within the
federal District of Columbia</p>

<p><catchwords>fourthly</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.010"/>

fourthly, that slaves
escaping or captured
from disloyal masters
shall not be restored to
slavery but shall be free.</p>

<p>These and numerous other
equally liberal acts fortify
us in the belief that the
United States Government
will not fail to accord us
any assistance in its
power in view of the imminent
emergencies to which I have
referred.</p>

<p>In closing this
communication, I beg to
express the hope that the
lamentable civil war
now distracting your
lately prosperous and
happy country, may be 
<catchwords>brought</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0181.011"/>

brought to a speedy
termination, consistent
with the honor and dignity
of the United States, conducive
to the welfare and happiness 
of all the inhabitants of that
great country, and promotive
of the cause of civil liberty
throughout the world.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,
with the highest consideration, 
Sir, your most obedient
humble Servant,<lb/>
Edwd W. Blyden</p>
