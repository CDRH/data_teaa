<note>No. 11</note>

<p>Consulate of the United States,<lb/>
at Loanda, Sept. 30, 1891</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State,<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of instructions
no 7. stating that my report on direct steam
communication with W. Africa had been received
and copy transmitted to Postmaster General.</p>

<p>I have also received the circulars, dated
June, 20, 23, 26, 17, 25, July 1, 14, and 
duly noted contents. I will answer the
queries made in two of them, as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>During the portion of quarter ending this
day and beginning Sept 1., date of my assuming 
my duties, no American Vessels have
entered or left this port and no fees have
been received at this Consulate.</p>

<p>For the same period I enclose Forms
No. 25, 90, 103, 159, 117, 118, &amp; 119.</p>

<p>The balance of my account for salary

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0565.003"/>

and contingent expenses is $82.91/100 for
which amount I have drawn on the Hon.
Secretary of the Treasury in favor of Messers.
Bywater, Tanqueray &amp; Phayre, 17 Broadway
New-York.</p>

<p>As the officials and people here constantly
conformed a Commercial Agent with a Consular
Agent, it will be well to have my title
changed to that of Consul as soon as possible.</p>

<p>From a letter of the Treasury Department
to Mr. Downing, it appears that he was allowed 
ninety days salary for period of 
transit. Based on this precedent, if correct,
I take the liberty to ask the Department,
if possible, to allow me my salary for the 
days (exceeding the fifty drawn drawn for) which
I necessarily spent on the way to this port.
I sailed from New York on July 1st, arrived 
in Loanda on Aug. 31 took charge on Sept
1, &amp; began services on Sept. 2, 1891</p>

<p>I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Heli Chatelain<lb/>
U.S. Coml. Agent</p>
