<note>Department of State Received Sep 29 1886</note>

<p>Department of State<lb/>
Monrovia. August 23rd 1886</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>In view of the vacancy
at present existing in the
Legation of the United
States at Monrovia occasioned 
by the loss so recently
sustained by it, in the decease
of the Honorable M. A. 
Hopkins the esteemed 
Minister Resident of the
United States near this 
Government, and not having
been officially informed
of the appointment of any 
Vice Consul here for your 
Government, I have the
honor by direction of
The President to communicate 
to the Government
of the United States the
<catchwords>following</catchwords>

<fw type="address">Hon
T. F. Bayard<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Department of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.<lb/>
U.S.A.</fw>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.002"/>

following circumstances
which in his opinion constitute 
a grave peril for
the territorial integrity,
and even the very existence
of this Republic.</p>

<p>During the year 1883,
the attention of the Government
of the United States was
called to certain suspicious
movements on the part of
the French Government
toward Liberia, apparently
looking towards a forcible
seizure of a portion of our
territory known as Kents
island, in the Mannah
River, in our northwestern
territories and concerning
which the Honorable
J. H. Smyth Minister
Resident of the United States,
while communicating at the 
request of this Government,
the contents of a Despatch No.
49 Diplomatic, which he had
received from Mr Secretary
Frelinghuysen and dated
"Department

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.003"/>

Department of State, Washington 
August 19, 1884, <unclear extent="four words"/>
"I was
pleased to enclose the <unclear>same</unclear>
and to ask that you keep me
advised, as to any nation
of France against the
territorial integrity of the 
Republic."</p>

<p>In keeping with this request 
the undersigned had
the honor to convey to Minister 
Smyth between the 1st and
2nd December 1885, the 
intelligence of the doings of the
French naval Department
Arnoux of the Gun Boat
"Gabes" at Beriby in our
South Eastern Territory,
and to request him to transmit 
the same for the information 
of his Government.</p>

<p>Our Chargè d'Affaires
at Paris was also communicated 
with under date of
8/10 December 1885, and
directed to bring the actions
of Mr. Armoux to knowledge
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.004"/>

of his Government, in order
that a stop might be put 
to such unfriendly actions
on the part their subordinates.
(See Enclosure I.)</p>

<p>On the 25th of February
1886, this Government received 
another illustration
of the hostile intentions of
France towards it, by the
visit of the "Voltigeur" Captain
Dumont, to Beriby and 
Monrovia, and his declarations 
made to the Government 
at the latter place.
In response to a note of
inquiry received from
Minister Hopkins (see
Enclosure 1a), the undersigned 
made him acquainted 
with the facts of this
new case for the information
of his Government,
and in the 3rd paragraph
of that communication
gave to the representative
of the United States his
impressions as to the
<catchwords>complicity</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.005"/>

complicity of the French
Government within the actions
of its officers, and their 
real intentions toward
this Republic. (see Enclosure 2)</p>

<p>Our representation at
Paris was again requested
to bring this bolder act of
aggression to the notice of 
the French Government, and
again to request that its 
naval officers be prohibited
in future from the exercise of
such reprehensible actions
against the territories of a 
friendly state. (See Enclosure 3.)</p>

<p>I have the honor to 
enclose copies of the entire 
correspondence had between the
United States Legation 
and this Department, and
also between this Government
and our Chargè d'Affaires
at Paris; on this subject, from
which it will clearly appear
that the French Government
after allaying the fears of 
<catchwords>our</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.006"/>

our representative, and
endeavoring to lull our
suspicions to sleep, have
at length boldly thrown off  
the mask, by declaring that
by a Treaty or Deed of Cession 
granted the Chiefs of Grand
and Little Bereby &amp;c in the year
1868, those territories were
ceded to that Government,
(see Enclosure M. Carrance
to President Johnson.) thus
fully justifying the 
apprehensions which were expressed 
by the undersigned to
Minister Hopkins in his 
despatch before mentioned, of
March 5th 1886, and apparently
conflicting with the statement 
of Commander Arnoux
and Dumont at the be the existence
of said Treaty in 
1833 and 1838.</p>

<p>The glaring inconsistency 
of this claim of the French
Government is at once apparent 
on its force. The Independence 
of the Republic of
<catchwords>Liberia</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.007"/>

Liberia was recognized by 
France by Treaty in the year 
1854. The State of Maryland
in Liberia had acquired the
territory now claimed by 
France in 1846 or thereabouts,
and was with all her territories, 
waters, debts and dues
admitted as an integral
portion of this Republic, in
1857.</p>

<p>No obligations were raised
by any European Power to
the claim of the State of 
Maryland in Liberia to
these territories, neither was
any objection made to Liberia's 
assuming jurisdiction
over these territories as a
part of the State of Maryland 
in Liberia when it
was incorporated into the
Republic of Liberia, which
facts were made public
to the world at the time.</p>

<p>If it true that the
French Government obtained 
from the Chiefs of Grand
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.008"/>

and Little Beriby cession
of these territories in the
year 1868, the cession was
certainly invalidated by
the <del>entire</del> <unclear>earliest</unclear> titles of the
Republic of Liberia to
the territories in question.</p>

<p>Again the alleged claim
of France to the said
Territories if such claim exists,
has never been published
to the world, Liberia having
been allowed, before during,
and after the year 1868, to
exercise undisputed control 
over the whole coast line
from Cape Palmas to
the San Pedro River.</p>

<p>If this new doctrine of 
France is permitted to
obtain with respect to 
Liberia, the existence of
the Republic cannot be
guaranteed for a single
day, but is in great danger of being
extinguished at any moment,
by any Power having a desire
for territorial agrandisement
<catchwords>on</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.009"/>

on the Coast of the African continent, 
and who might obtain
Deeds of Cession dating long after
those granted to the American
Colonization Society and this Government.</p>

<p>The Papers relation to the Cession
of the Beriby territories to the State
of Maryland in Liberia may be 
obtained of the Honorable John B.
Latrobe, President of the American 
Colonization Society, 
Washington D.C. who was one of the 
founders of the sate of 
Maryland in Liberia.</p>

<p>In the despatches (copies 
enclosed) from Consul General Carrance
to President Johnson, referring
to the recent correspondence
between the French Government
and himself relation to the
Arnoux and Dumont affairs, M.
de Freycinet seems to be extremely
irritated at what he is pleased
to term the interference of the
United States in the affairs
of the independent State of
<catchwords>Liberia</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.010"/>

Liberia, and demands the right
of the United States to intervene
in these affairs. He goes so far
as to assert that if these 
interferences be continued, it will
cause friendly relations to be 
broken off, not between France
and the United States which
he is pleased to term an 
"interferer," but with the Republic
of Liberia, the Government of
which has ever studiously 
endeavored to avoid giving just grounds
of offence or complaint to the
French Government.</p>

<p>We, recognize to right of the
United States to interfere in our
affairs for the reasons assigned by
you, in your despatch No 67, to
Minister <unclear extent="one name"/> Paris, of being
"Liberia's best next friend."</p>

<p>France having no colonies
or territories adjacent or
contiguous to Liberia, and
then being no commercial
intercourse either way, no
questions of boundary, ill
treatment of French citizens

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.011"/>

or any other questions ever
at issue between us.</p>

<p>You are doubtless aware
that France has for many years
been secretly endeavoring
to gain a foothold or to actively 
intervene for the purpose
of dismembering the Republic.</p>

<p>Between the years 1860-70,
under the Second Empire,
an attempt was made to
destroy the Republic, by laying
claim to Grand Bassa, a point 
some 50 or 60 miles south of 
Monrovia. Also an alternate
agreement originating with
French Government was
made with another Power
to dismember the Republic, 
one Power annexing
down to Cape Mount on the
North, the French from Cape
Palmas southwards.</p>

<p>These intentions were frustrated 
at that time by the
Franco-German war.</p>

<p>But France now finds it
convenient to recommence

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.012"/>

her aggressions against
Liberia, while professing
cordial friendship and
esteem for the Republic, we
notice the <unclear>Bullio</unclear> Affair
(evidently inspired), at Mannah
Rock 1884, the Arnoux affair
in 1885, Dumont in 1886, and
the intrigues of her Roman
Catholic Priests at the
present actively carried
on in Monrovia and last
but not least the bold
declaration of M. de Freycinet 
laying claim to an
integral portion of our
territory.</p>

<p>In view of these threatening
movements of the French
Government against us,
I am directed to acquaint
your Government with the
facts, and to solicit a
continuance of your good 
offices, to be exerted in
such a shape as will best
protect us from the ambitious 
projects of France
<catchwords>against</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0200.013"/>

against our territorial
integrity.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your most obedient servant<lb/>
E. A. Barclay</p>
