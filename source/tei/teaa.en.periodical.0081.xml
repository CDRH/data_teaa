<head type="sub">The Congo Infamy</head>

<p>At last the world is waking to the shocking truth that King Leopold's pretended philanthropy in the Congo is in reality a ghastly lie. The whole Congo country is recklessly exploited for private gain by this human monster. The report of a commission appointed by the Belgian Chamber of Deputies showed that the natives had been flagrantly robbed of their rights, that shocking and revolting cruelties were practiced in forcing the natives to gather rubber for the government and that whenever prosecutions were begun against white men for crimes against natives, the proceedings were always quashed. The Berlin Conference of 1885 intrusted the Congo to Leopold's keeping. Then, as now, he pretended to be a philanthropist and said he wanted to improve the country for the natives. His whole course in the matter has belied his words. Today there is <sic>discernable</sic> the rising of an international indignation at Leopold's indecencies. A resolution has been introduced in Congress calling for action by the United States in promoting an international investigation of the Congo. Of course, the first thing Congress ought to do is to appoint a commission to investigate the Southern part of this country. But still the Congo question deserves attention from Congress. The newspapers have discovered that Leopold has a paid lobby in Washington to prevent the adoption of the resolution introduced. The Congo Reform Association of Boston is doing great work in promoting the investigation. Leopold in the Congo is a stench in the nostrils of modern civilization.</p>
