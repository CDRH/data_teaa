<note>Department of State Received Feb 27 1888</note>

<p>United States Consulate.<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda<lb/>
December 30 1887.</p>

<p>Mr Downing<lb/>
To the Department of State.</p>

<p>Subject:</p>

<p>Trade with S.W. Africa</p>

<p>Abstract of contents:</p>

<p>Trade with U.S. almost nil., methods 
suggested for cultivation &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="Scan90015"/>

<note>No. 17.</note>

<p>United States Consulate.<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda<lb/>
December 30 1887.</p>

<p>Hon. George L. Rives,<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to enclose
herewith copies and translations of letters
received at this Consulate from the
undermentioned commercial houses 
of this city, Viz: Messrs Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co,
Messrs Baines Larsen &amp; Co.,
Messrs Palhares and Irmãos,
Messrs Souza Lara &amp; Co., and
Messrs <unclear>Sevart</unclear> &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Referring to inclosure No 1,
"Messrs Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co." it seems to me
as being worthy of study, in so far that,
although it bears the signature of the
firm above mentioned, it is an emanation 
of the individual. Mr Newton, who
is a Vice Consul of the United States,
<catchwords>But</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan90016"/>

but I fancy to do it justice, it should
be read as coming from a Consular
Officer of the British Government, and
an English merchant jealous of opposition.</p>

<p>It appears singular that after the
many years Mr Newton has acted as
U.S. Consul here, that the first merchants
in the place can say "that American
goods are not used because they are
not known," considering this, the fact
that he can see "no inducements for
American merchants &amp;c," may find explanation 
in his method of performing
the duties of U.S. Consul as far as they
relate to the <sic>extention</sic> of our foreign
trade.</p>

<p>It is <sic>apparant</sic> that the inclosure
above referred to, in its treatment of
the subject under consideration either
does not grasp its importance or is
influenced by a desire to discourage
new departures. It seems strange tho',
that a successful merchant with
large experience, in referring to

<pb n="Scan90017"/>

causes affecting the commercial growth of a 
nation, should allow his thoughts to be
confined to a question of three or four
years, or that he should limit himself
to the consideration of one product when
commenting upon the resources of a country
so rich in natural agricultural and
manufactured products as ours.</p>

<p>Enclosure No 2: Messrs Baines Lauer &amp; Co.
interested in the growth of commercial relation 
between this province and the U.S. 
adopt a tome that carries with it the
impression of honest expression and considerable 
study. I am unfortunately, because
of limited experience, unable to judge
correctly as to the value of their suggestions 
relative to the method to be
adopted to enable American Capital
to get a firm foothold in the part
of Africa, but, as far as a knowledge
of the West Coast gives me a right to
judge of here. I think they are in 
some respects, right.</p>

<p>It is worthy of attention
that this firm in referring to cottons
<catchwords>would</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan90018"/>

strengthen their statements by forwarding samples
showing that if the U.S. desires to place
cotton on this market, it will be necessary
for her manufacturers to enter into a competition 
of inferiority, but an examination 
of those used in the Northern districts
shows an improvement in quality such as
"our honesty," allows us to manufacture.
These samples with samples of corals
mentioned by this firm, I have forwarded 
to the Department.</p>

<p>Inclosure No. 3. Messrs Palhares &amp; Irmãos,
in contradiction to Messrs Newton, Carnegie 
&amp; Co. though acquainted with only one 
of the products of our country, believe
that the introduction of American
commodities is to be desired.</p>

<p>Inclosure No. 4. Messrs Sousa Lara
and Co., have an experience limited
to yellow &amp; pitch pine.</p>

<p>Inclosure No. 5. Messrs Sevart &amp; Co,
refer to England and Germany as the
countries of supply for this trade, ignorant 
of our capacity, they seem to think
that our products are only such as
would

<pb n="Scan90019"/>

would appeal to the requirements
of the European population, yet they
believe, "American goods, may be introduced 
with advantage on this market."</p>

<p>These letters are from of the
first commercial people of Loanda the
longest shippers and importers. It will
be recognized that, with one exception
they are remarkably unanimous in looking
at things in a narrow way, a comprehensive 
view of the possibilities of the country
seems to beyond their ability or desire
and to any influence beyond those 
which affect small and immediate
pecuniary returns, <unclear>these</unclear> are dead.</p>

<p>The great nations of Europe 
find here, and in adjoining districts
valuable outlets for their industries. 
Taught by experience the value of representation, 
there is not a spot of commercial 
value on the coast where
English or German houses have not
planted their need. The factors with
which these countries have excused
these gratifying results, should not 
<catchwords>be</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan90020"/>

be particular to them, but ought to be
common to all alike. Commercial enterprise 
environed by good <sic>judgmt</sic>, is their
secret. American industries can find their
way into and secure a safe place in these
centres, if Americans will adopt the
methods as practiced by the English and
Germans. Resident representative, coming
for contact with the native, learning his
needs and securing an intimate knowledge 
of the trade, a supply of merchandise,
steady in its flow and independent of
good and bad seasons alike, direct
communication, cheap and rapid. Given
these qualities, it would be seen that
in a few years our increasing industries
I would find outlets in many parts of
the world where now the reports of
our country's industries and greatness 
are looked upon as almost a romance.</p>

<p>To open the eyes of these people
to the value of our goods it is necessary
that some method be adopted to bring
them under their notice. This might
be done by the establishment here,

<pb n="Scan90021"/>

under the supervision of this Consulate,
of a Sample Room, where could be
displayed, at a nominal cost, full
lines of our commodities. This Enterprise,
preparing a way for future and increasing 
movements, would receive
valuable assistance from Messrs Baines,
Lauer &amp; Co.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir:<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
Henry F. Downing,<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<p>St Paul de Loanda 10th, Nov. 1887</p>

<p>Henry F. Downing, Esq<lb/>
United States Consul,<lb/>
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In answer to your letter of the 1st
inst., we beg to reply as follows.</p>

<p>We see no inducement for
American merchants to invest in the Angola
trade as there are too many houses already for
the trade and they would have every <unclear>thing</unclear>
against them. They would have no direct communication
and unless their good were shipped through
Lisbon they would have to pay the import duty which
is a difference of 30%.</p>

<p>We do nothing with American
goods, although a few years ago we used to have two
cargoes a year. There is however a considerable quantity
of pitch pine timber imported and this year three
cargoes have come from Pensacola, but now the port
is supplied for some time to come. We have given
up the trade ourselves as we found the profit
to be too small to be worth the time and
trouble.</p>

<p>When the Railway is finished
we have not the slightest doubt but that
trade will greatly increase but that will take

<pb n="Scan90023"/>

three or four years at least. The American
import which is timber, will, we think instead
of increasing be reduced as good wood is to
be had in the interior.</p>

<p>We have really no statistics before
us to offer you but we shall always be happy
at any time, in assisting you to get any information 
you may wish for.</p>

<p>We are sir,<lb/>
Your most obedient servant<lb/>

December 28th 1887</p>

<p>Henry F. Downing Esq.<lb/>
U.S. Consul,<lb/>
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>In reply to your official letter asking
us for information relative to local outlets
for American products we have the honor
to inform you that we have made a special
study of this question, and have for the
last year, exerted ourselves to open up correspondence 
on the subject.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have consulted other
firms in our city and have become familiar
with the local idea that American 
products are limited to Lumber and
Petroleum.</p>

<p>We take it that you wish to have
a plain statement on our side of what
can be done and how to do it. The
matter is however, a very complex one
and must be treated at length, for
our ground extends not only to this neighborhood
but to the North Coast and the
Congo River.</p>

<pb n="Scan90026"/>

<p>Angola. Loanda.</p>

<p>Here very little has come in beyond Petroleum, lumber
and occasional lots of flour and soap.</p>

<p>Petroleum. The consumption in Loanda = about 30 cases
of 10 gal. each, per diem = 900 cases per month.
Novo Redondo, Benguela, Mossamedes, S. Thomé
and Banana = probably 2500 cases per month.
Dondo and the other River and interior towns
another 1600 = 5000 cases of 10 gals. ea. per
month for this province. To secure a monopoly
of this trade it would be necessary to crush
competition, and to do this the stuff would
have to be put <unclear>cif</unclear> in most of the ports mentioned 
@ Reis <unclear>fortes</unclear> 1$250. In Banana and
Cabinda better prices rule. In Cabinda one
contrast with the Government is for Reis 1$960
per case. Custom duties in all these ports except
Banana and Cabinda, which are free = 20
Reis per kilo.</p>

<p>Lumber. There are now five Loanda forms selling lumber
and we are awaiting a consignment from Norway.
Occasional lots, say 400 tons, would sell in 
about 3 months @ an average of Reis 25$000
per 1000 ft. run. If you wish we will give
you Pro forma a/c sales. The duty is 15% a.d. <unclear extent="one word"/>
kind of lumber 5" sq yellow pine logs, match
boarding 1" &amp; 1/2" and <unclear extent="one or two words"/>. Shingles
might do well north but have no sale in

<pb n="Scan90027"/>

Loanda.</p>

<p>The one thing necessary for Angola trade
is to put "something called <unclear>Lop</unclear>" - hard, and
dark in color - on this market at a maximum
of Reis 3$000 per 50 kilos. <unclear>cif</unclear> Loanda. 
Consumption about 200 cases per month.</p>

<p>Flour. Fair quality such as that offered @ $3.50
to $4.00 in America should be put here <unclear>cif</unclear>
at $6.50 to $7.00. It sells well at about $8.00
in the Custom house. The consumption in
Loanda and interior towns average 500 
barrels monthly. By taking in the other
Angola, and the Congo ports this quantity
might be trebled.</p>

<p>Butter. Not good business in Loanda where
Normandy butter is preferred. It however
sells well North, selling price 450 reis per
lb: duty 20%.</p>

<p>Hams. In small lots have regular sales through
out. same prices and duties as butter.</p>

<p>Paints &amp; Oils. Are of importance in view of the various
Government contracts. Red lead (powder), in
kegs should arrive <unclear>cif</unclear> @ 161 to 171- per 50
kilos as a maximum, others in proportion
Terpentine and Raw Linseed oil at 5d
and 6d kilo.</p>

<p>Furniture. In carefully assorted lots, cheap and
showy stuff (best taken to pieces and put

<pb n="Scan90028"/>

up here), such as carpet seated and fancy 
chairs, wardrobes and chiffoniers, writing
tables (plain with two to four drawers), stools,
folding hatracks, commode, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. sell well
if cheap. Take for instance as a basis a
"showy" 5 ft. wardrobe @ from $35.00 to $40.00, 
(without mirror).</p>

<p>Soft Goods. Table cloths and napkins; handkerchiefs; &amp;c,
have regular sales at low prices. Duties linen
780 reis per kilo, cotton 500 reis.</p>

<p>Tea. Of fair quality (black and green) sells @
800 to 900 reis per lb. Duty 240 reis per $.</p>

<p>Cheese. Regular sales in small lots, selling @
400 to 450 Reis lb. duty 25%.</p>

<p>Canned Goods. American canned goods are not known.
Canned Beef put up by the "Armour Co" is
however much favored @ 500 reis per 2 lb
tin.</p>

<p>Lard. Good business in regular lots sells @ 220
reis per lb. Duty 20%.</p>

<p>Matches. Cannot compete with the Germans.</p>

<p>Cod fish If very dry has large sale. It would
be advisable to experiment with <unclear>Newfoundland</unclear>.</p>

<p>Cotton Goods. So far as this province (apart from
the District of the Congo) is connected there
is one great obstacle in the way of American
products, and that is American honesty.
Our cottons (equalling in value 50 Rs 500:00

<pb n="Scan90029"/>

monthly), are made up with starch and clay 
and generally falsified, a fair price for a fair
article cannot be obtained. We well give you 
samples.</p>

<p>Guns. Flintlock guns (called Lazzarino) 1 ball 3/4 ball
&amp; 1/2 ball), are supplied by England and Germany
at 5/- each. These sell here in the Custom house
@ about 5/9.</p>

<p>Demijohns. Of 5 gals. wicker covered sell @ 600 to 700 reis. Duty
25%. Sales from 500 to 1000 per month. They are
usually sent filled with rice.</p>

<p>Rice. Rangoon sells @ 1000 reis per 15 kilos. Duty
15 reis per kilo. Large consumption.</p>

<p>Sugar. Sells well in regular lots @ reis 2,200 per 15 kilos
for <unclear>lump</unclear> <unclear>chystallized</unclear> and reis 1,900 per 15 kilos for
Brown Sugar. Duties refined 40 reis kilo. unrefined
20 reis kilo.</p>

<p>Tobacco. Prohibition duties = 3$200 reis per kilo.</p>

<p>Clocks. American alarm clocks and the very cheapest
watches. good sale for small lots.</p>

<p><unclear>Candles</unclear> Are invoiced to us at 35 francs per 100 kilos</p>

<p>Cast off Army Uniforms. sell largely in the interior but
should not be invoiced at more than 400 to 500
reis per garment.</p>

<p>Barrel &amp; Pipe Staves. Sell well</p>

<p>Small Articles. We are now about to experiment with these in
great variety, and it will be better to advise
you later on.</p>

<pb n="Scan90030"/>

<p>Rum. 40° clear. Should be put here <unclear>cif</unclear> at Rs 28,000
per 130 gals. safe shipments including northern
ports about 50 pipes.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks will serve to give you some
idea of the prospects offered in this province proper. In
view of the future, however, we have to consider the probable
commercial changes resultant upon the completion of the
Loanda and Ambaca Railway.</p>

<p>The Railway <unclear>Service</unclear>,
was originally formulated with the idea of opening
up the <unclear extent="one word"/> gold fields to the North of Golungo Alto.
Its value, however does not depend upon any speculative
enterprise but upon the natural resources of the province.
The fertile districts of Cazengo, Golungo Alto. <unclear>Enconge</unclear> &amp;c.,
producing coffee, rubber, palm oil, <sic>kernals</sic> &amp;c. in great
abundance are practically robbed of their value by
the difficulties of transport.</p>

<p>At times carriers are not to be had to
the river ports, but were <unclear>there</unclear> no difficulty in this respect
the excessive rates of the Companhia da Vapor de Quanza 
would be sufficient to heavily handicap any enterprise.</p>

<p>We will give you the figures, premising that
the produce is practically unlimited; given proper
merchandise and rapid transport the trade of
Angola would assume an importance it has never
yet possessed. From <unclear>Enconge</unclear> to Donda, 5 days journey
Each carrier will take kilos of coffee, price per
carrier per trip 4$000 ries. Therefore each ton of

<pb n="Scan90031"/>

coffee requires 14 1/2 carriers and costs from <unclear>Enconge</unclear> 
to Donda 58$000 Reis From Donda to Loanda
by the Quanza River Steamers the freight is 40
reis per ton per kilametre. Donda is 200 kilametres
from Loanda, Ex. 200 x 40 = 8000 Reis x 58 Rs 000 = 66$
about $70.00 per ton over 124 miles. The natural
consequence is that the interior plantations are
continually losing money and are all <unclear extent="one word"/>
to the Bank. Here again we have the
secret of the falsified goods. Now all this
the Railway will remedy by tapping the Cazengo,
Galungo and <unclear>Enconge</unclear> districts, enabling us to
<unclear>vend</unclear> our goods up cheaply and rapidly and get
our produce down <unclear extent="one word"/> equally advantageous
circumstances.</p>

<p>The Railway will be built and will pay
well. It is however, at present in dubious hands.
If things go wrong it may be five years before
the lines <unclear extent="two words"/>: if not three years will
enable it to at least mitigate the <unclear extent="one word"/> we have
mentioned.</p>

<p><unclear extent="two words"/> the line will be built because
if the company fails in its obligation a Syndicate
of African merchants is prepared to come forward
and push the thing through.</p>

<p>District of the Congo</p>

<p>We would rather not go into detail as to the River
Congo itself as we are of opinion that any statement

<pb n="Scan90032"/>

would fall short of the reality. We have,
however, powerful friends there, and if we could
go on a comprehensive visit together much might
be arranged.</p>

<p>Outside of the Congo itself but within its
district we have outlets at Landana, Cabinda
and Ambrizette, not to mention S. Antonio on the
Congo. These places are supply under Government
Contracts with all kinds of provisions &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In this district trade is essentially different
to that of Angola proper, goods are only partially 
adulterated and falsified and there is yet
a good field for American Cottons of the lowest
quality. In Cabinda alone we can guarantee
150 tons of produce per month and with a few
more houses in the Chiloango river we have no doubt
that it could be quadrupled. As merchants we 
could sell you about 100 tons per month. Kernals
@ 400 reis per 32$, not to mention splendid hard
woods in any quantity.</p>

<p>Such produce is all bought in barter for:</p>

<p>1° Cotton as per samples, pieces 40" wide x 24 yds &amp; 24 <unclear>folds</unclear>
Handkerchiefs in piece of one dozen. Best sales, blue
boxes, checks, Hdkfs and red calico.</p>

<p>2° White and yellow metal anklets weighing 1 to 2
$ 1/2" - <unclear>plain</unclear></p>

<p>3° Cheap Bells of different sizes up to 6"</p>

<p>4° Rum 40°.</p>

<pb n="Scan90033"/>

<p>5° Red Corals as per samples. To resist heat and
hot water.</p>

<p>6° Keg powder. 2x4 <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<p>Here also can be sold regular lots of flour, <unclear>soap</unclear>
wine, shot, and sundry other article which we will
advise later. Products are kernals, Palm oil,
Rubber and Ground nuts. We think also that
a little pushing might arrange for a fair
quantity of ivory.</p>

<p>Estimated capital for this enterprise
as far as concerns establishing and stocking
ten (10) factories = $60,000.00. No American
labor required nor timber construction.</p>

<p>In conclusion we are of opinion that for 
America to be advantageously represented in
Africa it is necessary that:</p>

<p>1° A company be formed in America with at least
$200,000.00 Capital.</p>

<p>2° That an energetic and pushing firm be
appointed as African Manager with a "good

<p>Henry F. Downing, Esq.<lb/>
U.S. Consul,<lb/>
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>We beg to acknowledge your letter
of the 2d Ulto. in reply;</p>

<p>We are of opinion that the
introduction of American goods on this market
would exert a beneficial influence on local commerce
first by provoking competition and secondly by
placing on our lists a number of articles that
are not used because they are not known.</p>

<p>2. Petroleum is the only American
product we deal in. We are supplied by Lisbon
Germany, England and France.</p>

<p>3. It in probable that the Loanda
and Ambaca R'y and other schemes now being
exploited in Angola will in the immediate
future increase the volume of trade and open
up many other outlets for business.</p>

<p>We remain,<lb/>

lumber (yellow and pitch pine), as filling the
necessary conditions.</p>

<p>Loanda, Nov. 10. 1887.</p>

<p>Henry F. Downing, Esq.<lb/>
U.S. Consul,<lb/>
Loanda.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>We beg to acknowledge your favor
of the 4th inst., and have much pleasure in replying
to your various question.</p>

<p>The commerce of the United States,
altho' of great importance in itself, has only
manifested itself on a very small scale in our
possession of Angola, owing principally to the
limited market we have for any article not <unclear>essentially</unclear>
proper for the native trade.</p>

<p>This branch of manufacture
has been held by England from the outset and
include such articles as raw and striped cotton
fabrics, crocking, guns (flintlock), and powder.
We are not aware as to whether America can
compete in this line: the one known fact being
that the English and German market are
drawn upon exclusively.</p>

<p>As to other goods for the consumption
of the European population their importance
is relatively insignificant. We may however
remark:</p>

<p>1° We believe that American goods
may be introduced with advantage on our
market.</p>

<p>2° The principal articles which
have been handled by us in dealing with
America, have been pitch pine, petroleum,
<catchwords>soap</catchwords>

<pb n="Scan990003"/>

soap and furniture</p>

<p>Of these we have received consignments from 
Wilmington. It is however necessary to note that
petroleum and soap shipped direct cannot
compete in price with the same articles via Europe.
Petroleum in direct lots costs about double the
price of European shipments.</p>

<p>3° We have every hope that the commerce
of Angola will sooner or later improve in tone
owing principally to the Loanda &amp; Ambaca
R'y Scheme.</p>

<p>4° As we have already observed our relations
with the United States have been limited and
it has only been in timber that any real
business has been done.</p>

<p>We remain<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Yours respectfully,<lb/>
(S'gd), Sevart &amp; Co.</p>
