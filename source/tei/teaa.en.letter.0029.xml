others was on shore, gave them liberty
until 6 o'clock P.M. a little over their
time they came back to the Boat

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0029.005"/>

hand being stabbed in the left breast
bleeding freely I asked John Boges for
the Knife he immediately gave it to me
I also asked the deceased to give me the
Razor he refused, was obliged to take it
from him by force, soon after I saw
him lying on the deck, I gave orders for
him to be taken up and carried to the
forecastle I sent for the Doctor from the
Portuguese Steamer "Zaire," then Coaling
from my Ship and he was of opinion that
the Stab was mortal; I went aft and
then came forecastle in a few minutes,
the man was still alive I went aft again
and shortly after was told that he was
dead: during the voyage I have no reason
to suppose any ill feeling existed 
between the prisoner and deceased 
previously that should lead him to
commit the assault nor was he a 
disorderly man nor was the deceased 
after the deceased had been stabbed he
threatened to cut the prisoner being very
much intoxicated</p>

<p>Prisoner and deceased
went on shore with Captain Maxwell and
returned on board a little after Sun Set,
the Carpenter Benjamin Rees reported to me
that two of the men were quarrelling in the
forecastle I went foreward and saw the
brandishing an open Razor and swore that
he would cut any person who interfered
or came near him using at the same
time very abusive language: the prisoner
asked me to take him away or he should
hurt him I could not say whether the
prisoner had or had not a Knife in his hand
I went and reported to Captain Maxwell that
the men were quarreling the Captain then
came foreward and went into the forecastle
Witness and Carpenter Benjamin Rees
followed the deceased had been stabbed but
was still brandishing the Razor as before
Captain and Witness endeavored to take the
Razor from him and suppress the quarrel,
the Carpenter Benjamin Rees then took

the Razor from the deceased, we then laid
him down, the Captain sent for the Doctor
of Steamer "Zaire" then Coaling from us, I
asked the prisoner if he was sorry for what
he did, he replied no and would do it again
dam him, let him die like a dog and I
will hang like a man, Witness said you
have done this under the influence of Liquor
and tomorrow you will be sorry for it
prisoner replied and said I am perfectly
sober. I have no reason to suppose any
ill feeling existed between the deceased
and prisoner previously.</p>

<p>6th Witness John <unclear>Thackster</unclear> American
Citizen Seamen of Ship "Clara L. Preble"</p>

<p>I was sitting in the forecastle
about Sun Set deceased came on board
having been in attendance on the Captain
on shore, the deceased was in liquor, he
came into the forecastle with an opened
Razor is positive that it was opened I
left my seat when he was brandishing
the Razor for fear of getting cut, prisoner
came in at the time, deceased addressing
him, saying, I will cut the liver out of
you, the prisoner said go away my man I
dont want speak with you, you are in liquor
to night tomorrow morning if you
are a man I will speak with you the
deceased cut the prisoner on the thumb
he held out his hand to the deceased
and said see how you have cut me, one
of the Crew James Henry came into the
forecastle and persuaded the prisoner to
leave him, in hopes the deceased would
go to sleep. Witness thinks the prisoner
remained out about half an hour, he then
came in, leaning over his bunk, the deceased

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0029.012"/>

deceased still abusing him and laid
hold of him with the Razor still opened in 
his hands prisoner said leave me alone I
dont want to have anything to do with you
we will settle it in the morning prisoner 
then went followed by the deceased the
latter still holding the Razor open in his
hand, they went out by the Starboard
door and both entered the forecastle again
by the Port door, the deceased continued
the same irritating abusive and threatening
language, prisoner asked John
Symonds to lend him his knife to cut
some meat the deceased continued in
the same manner abusing and brandishing
the Razor: when the prisoner stabbed the
deceased in the left side with the Knife he
staggered to his bunk and fell; medical
assistance was immediately sent for
he survived only about half an hour, I
have no reason to suppose any ill feeling
existed between the deceased and prisoner
when the prisoner went out as before stated
he came back with the mate, the mate
<fw type="catch">tried</fw>

<p>I was one of the Crew of the
Captains Boat having left the Ship after
dinner and remained on shore, waiting
on the Captain until Sun Set when we 
went <sic>of</sic> to the Ship I was sober the others
were in liquor more particularly the
deceased who was very much intoxicated
and getting out of the boat I helped him
up the side of the Ship do not think he could
get up without help. when I came out of the 
boat after making her fast I saw the deceased
in the <sic>Gally</sic> talking with the Cook. I told
him to go to the forecastle. he went there.
deceased then took a Razor from his
waistband and throwing both his hands
up threaten "to cut the prisoners Guts out"
prisoner told him frequently to go away

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0029.014"/>

from him. deceased continued in the 
same threatening conduct for a quarter of 
an hour repeating the same words, but 
the razor was not opened the prisoner left
the forecastle for about five minutes and
then returned deceased repeated the
threats and language which he had
before used. Prisoner asked John
Symonds to lend him his Knife to cut
a piece of meat Symonds lent it to him
prisoner stood with the Knife in his hand
telling the other to desist and go away
deceased refused but rushed towards
him with his arms extended but holding
the Razor closed in his right hand, still
threatening the prisoner, he then stabbed the
deceased in the left side who reeled back
against a bunk Prisoner withdrew the
Knife the deceased continuing in the
same manner using abusive language
after he was stabbed. Prisoner said to
the deceased you need not fret any more
as you have had it into you (meaning 
the Knife). the prisoner then walks out of
the forecastle said he had done it for himself 

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0029.015"/>
