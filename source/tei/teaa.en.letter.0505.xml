<p>U.S. Consulate<lb/>
St. Paul de Loanda<lb/>
Washington, June 28, 1888</p>

<p>Hon. G. L. Rives<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Referring to certain changes
contained in despatch of Acting Vice
Consul Julius L. Judson of St. Paul
de Loanda dated May 16, 1888, I have 
the honor to inform the Department,
that leaving Loanda on the 17th of
March I arrived at Cabinda on the
19th of the same month where I found
Mr. Judson and delivered to him the
Consular Seal and Stamp with instructions 
to proceed immediately to
Loanda, but not to assume the duties
of his office until the 31st, when 
I would be leaving St. Thomé, the
Northern limit of the Consular district
which place I desired to visit for
<catchwords>the</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.002"/>

the purpose of gathering information
which might be of commercial value.</p>

<p>It is true that I returned to 
Mr Judson his bond. My motive for
doing this was not so much that it
was not properly made out, but
that, having no knowledge of the 
sureties named in the instrument,
I was not satisfied as to their responsibility, 
and I judged that by 
making it necessary for him to 
provide another, he would be forced 
to have it certified to by some of
the Portuguese authorities and thereby
give reason to believe in its value.</p>

<p>Against the charges as to my 
general behavior while in Loanda, I
do not know how to defend myself,
unless they are specified, but will 
say, that wherein any action of more
as U.S. Consul at Loanda, has been
subject matter for criticism, i have
to learn.</p>

<p>1st So far from being able
to take advantage of the "confidence
<catchwords>not</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.003"/>

not to say ignorance of the
Portuguese" for instance, by "paying
my bills with bogus drafts." I found
it impossible to get them to accept
good, honest government drafts, for,
with one exception, viz. Messrs Newton
Carnegie &amp; Co. There was no house
doing business in Loanda that
would handle an U.S. Consular
draft of any kind, and furthermore,
If Mr Judsons statements are to
be considered, value should be given
to that part of his despatch which
I here quote, "It is thought here
that the smallness of the salary,
is the reason that U.S. Consuls
sent here generally resort to financial 
treachery and intrigue and 
almost invariably leave in disgrace."
If this has been the experience of 
the Portuguese in Loanda with U.S. 
Consuls it is would seem that
they must be fond of having
their confidence and ignorance
again and again taken advantage
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.004"/>

of.</p>

<p>To my knowledge there has
been no business done by me with
paper, except with the well informed
houses of Newton, Carnegie &amp; Co. and
Baines, Lauer &amp; Co. and neither of
these houses are <sic>Portugese</sic>.</p>

<p>Referring to the statement
that on his arrival at Loanda, he
found that my creditors had seized
every thing belonging to the Consulate
I would respectfully inform the Department 
that in accordance with
arrangement entered into between
me, Baines Lauer &amp; Co. and my creditors,
Messrs Baines, Lauer &amp; Co. relieved
me from all other creditors but themselves, 
by taking upon their house
my debts and the seizure, I think,
will resolve itself in a matter of
an owner taking possession of 
what he was authorized by me 
to take. This is explained as follows:
I had certain furniture from
a dealer, for household use, for
<catchwords>which</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.005"/>

which I was to pay 40 mil
reis per month. To protect himself, 
Mr Quadra, the owner just
before my departure furnished 
me with an <unclear>inreceipted</unclear> bill of
sale and requested me to attach
a note to same stating in set
terms that the property was his,
and that he was authorized
to remove some at such time
as best suited his convenience.
This I did, and I suppose that
Mr Quadra acted upon his rights.
Mr Judson was cognizant of
this arrangement for he, with
me, called upon Mr Quadra and 
arranged with this dealer to carry
the contract over, on the same
terms. Mr Judson at the same 
time called with me on the owner 
of the house where was located
the Consular office, and contracted
to continue my lease. Therefore,
that this property was taken away
may be true, but, that the property
<catchwords>of</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.006"/>

of the United States was seized
I fancy a statement that should be
viewed with suspicion, particularly
that part which refers to the action
of his Excellency the Governor General, 
i.e., in refusing to take cognizance
of the matter. From my knowledge
of this Portuguese gentleman, I think
that he is too careful and well 
informed an official to subject
himself to reprimand or recall,
by encouraging an infraction
of the Treaty between the U.S. and
Portugal. Furthermore, how could
my "victims" be led to believe
that the U.S. Government would
be any more responsible for my
debts of Consuls who <sic>preceeded</sic>
me. If this view of the case is
accepted, it will seem that 
the payment of my debts, means the
purchase of household furniture
by Mr. Judson, for his personal use.</p>

<p>I would respectfully
<catchwords>inform</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.007"/>

inform the Department that
one copy of Consular Instructions
of 1881 as well as all correspondence
properly docketed and filed away,
as well as furniture somewhat in
excess of what is allowed is or 
should be at the office of the
Consulate.</p>

<p>Referring again to Mr
Judsons statement, that he has
no Consular Instruction no forms,
no products or anything I would
say that Mr. Judson was a guest
at my home there fore quite
two weeks when I tried to educate
him into the duties of the office,
and it seems quite a coincidence,
that he could so happily name
the right acct, "miscellaneous
expenses." for his draft in favor
of Mr Hass of Lisbon.</p>

<p>Mr Edmond A. Baines
may not be in Loanda, but he 
is then in Cabinda where Mr 
Judson resided, but, Mr Baines
<catchwords>should</catchwords>

<pb n="teaa.en.letter.0505.008"/>

should be in Loanda no later than 
August.</p>

<p>In connection with the
above, I would respectfully submit
the enclosed letter from Mr Judson
to me which I find, bears the same
date as his despatch to the Department.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of the Rev.
Mr. Judson, from others, that can 
reflect unfavorably, upon his
character, I have confined myself
to facts.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,<lb/>
Sir,<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
Henry F. Downing<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>

<p>List of enclosures<lb/>
No. 1 Mr Judson to Mr. Downing.</p>
