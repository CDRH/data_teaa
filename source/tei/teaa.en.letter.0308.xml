<p>United States Commercial
Agency at Gaboon<lb/> 
November 10th 1876</p>

<p>Hon John L. Cadwalader<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your Dispatch No 46,
bearing date August 17th 1876.
It was not received at this office,
till monday October 30th.</p>

<p>I regret exceedingly, the action of
Congress, that has rendered it
necessary to discontinue the office
of Commercial Agent at Gaboon.
The removal of our flag, proud
symbol of liberty &amp; right, from
Gaboon, where it has so long
floated, will be prejudicial
to American Commerce, and 
especially to the Philanthropic
and Christianizing enterprise
of the American Missions which
extends about 100 miles both north.

<pb/> 

and south of Gaboon; and nearly
200 miles into the interior of Africa.
With sadness, I hasten to comply
with your instructions, to close the
office, and render final accounts;
reserving for another Dispatch, a
request, which Mr J. H. Reading and
myself, propose to make to the Department,
that we be <sic>permited</sic> to retain
the archives, and resume the functions
of the Commercial Agency, receiving
only the Fees for our services.</p>

<p>Per last mail, I transmitted my Returns,
and Accounts, for the Quarter ending 
September 30th, but drew no drafts
for salary, or other expenses. A new
salary Account, will be forwarded
to the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury.
My salary from July 1st to September
20th amounts to $220.<unclear>10</unclear>. Since July 1st
I have received from Fees as already
returned, $21.96. Deducting this amount,
and also $20.00 "extra wages," on hand,
from the salary credit: there remains
$17<unclear>8</unclear>.14; for which amount I have

<pb/>

drawn a draft upon the Hon Secretary
of the Treasury.</p>

<p>During the period of my service
as Commercial Agent, I have presented
no account for rent, and
miscellaneous expenses; as my predecessors
in the office, were accustomed 
to do; and have now none to render.
The archives are safely kept in
an iron house, and as soon as my 
health will permit, I will take a careful
inventory of them, and sent a
copy to the Department of State per
mail.</p>

<p>The earliest safe, and direct opportunity
to send the archives to the 
United States will be several months
hence; and in the mean time,
we hope to receive permission to
retain them, and continue the
Agency.</p>

<p>In reference to my return to the
United States, for which provision
has been made to continue the
salary for 35 days during the

<pb/>

time of transit, hence to the 
United States; I am sorry to
inform you, that my medical
adviser, under whose care I have been
<unclear>serving</unclear> the last two months, decides
against my leaving at present.
I have already requested of the
Department, leave of absence early
next year; &amp; still hope I may be
able to leave by that time, &amp; should
the provision referred to, be extended
till that time, I shall be glad to
avail myself of it.</p>

<p>I have now completed a third of a 
century of toils &amp; sacrifices, in Western
Africa, in Philanthropic &amp; Christian
work, the abolition of the Slave
Trade, &amp; the introduction of Christian
Civilization into this dark
land. My life has been almost
miraculously preserved, &amp; now I
believe I remain alone, the only
white man on the coast, who was
here 33 years ago, when I arrived.
During this period it has been

<pb/>

encouraging to witness the substitution
of commerce for the Slave
Trade, the rapid exploration
of the country, &amp; the introduction
of Christian Civilization, with its
inestimable blessings.</p>

<p>Permit me to express my thanks
to the officers of the Department
of State, for their courtesy to me during
the period I have held the Commercial Agency.</p>

<p>Should my health be restored,
by a brief visit to the United States;
I hope to return and resume my
labors here; and we trust our Mission
House will continue to be a refuge
for every American citizen who may
visit the Gaboon; whether we have
the right to render official assistance
or not.</p>

<p>With great respect,<lb/>
Sir;<lb/>
I remain<lb/>
Your Obedient Servant<lb/>
Albert Bushnell<lb/>
U.S. C. Agent</p>
