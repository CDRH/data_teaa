<p>An Army in Africa</p>

<p>The Remarkable March of 100,000 Mohammedans to the West Coast.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>Secretary of State Bayard is in receipt of a dispatch from Sierra Leone, giving accounts of the movements of an army of 100,000 men in the interior of Africa. The dispatch was sent by United States Consul Lewis, who says:</p>

<p>"I have the honor to bring to the notice of the department of state the fact of an extraordinary movement among the Mohammedans of the Nigritian regions, extending from Timbuctoo to the west coast. It appears that in 1880 a Mandingo named Samudu, of extraordinary intelligence and energy, conceived the idea that he was called by God to wage a war for the suppression of paganism and the opening of the roads to the coast, which in certain districts have been for generations subjected to excessive blackmail and to the plundering of vagabond tribes. During the last five years he has collected an army, consisting of foot and horse, of about 100,000 men. Mohammedan youths, wherever he goes, flock to his standard, anxious not only to secure the reward in the hereafter promised to those who fight for their religion, but to carry off the rich spoils of time which these expeditions that battle for the faith are sure to win. It is said that Samudu's army is divided into three portions: one is operating near the headwaters of the Niger. This portion recently drove certain French troops from the gold regions of Boure, of which they had taken possession, and are now besieging Bammakoo, a large town on the Niger, occupied about three years ago by the French, who have been erecting fortifications there. Another portion of the army is operating in the regions east of Liberia, and by suppressing the disturbing elements, unfettering trade and introducing a knowledge of religion and letters is in one sense opening the way for negro emigrants of intelligence and energy from America to push out from the African American republic to the healthy and fertile regions of the interior. In another sense it is forestalling the whole region for Mohammedanism and making it difficult, if not impossible, if indeed, it is desirable, to convert that country to the faith imported from America by the emigrants. The third portion of the army is approaching the coast a few miles northwest of Sierra Leone. It has secured the submission by force or by voluntary surrender of all the tribes on the way for 300 miles back."</p>
