<p>Judson A. Lewis - To Dept State.</p>

<p>Threatened Ashantee War</p>

<p>No. 47. U.S. Consulate at<lb/>
Sierra Leone Feb. 5th 1881.</p>

<p>Hon Jay Hay<lb/>
Ass't Sect'y State<lb/>
Washington</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have to inform
the Department, of the threatening
aspect of affairs on
the "Gold Coast" - as the King 
of Ashantee has again
<sic>declaired</sic> war on the English
Colonial Government Headquarters
at Accra.</p>

<p>It is generally thought in <unclear>Some</unclear>
official circles, that if the
Ashantees fight again, they 
will be a still more formidable
foe than before - for it is believed
they are well armed with breech
loaders and not a few pieces
of artillery - they have the reputation
of being brave - standing up and

<pb n="604"/>

receiving the bullets square in
their breasts.</p>

<p>On Friday Jan 28th the Mail
Steamer "Corisco" arrived in
Port from the Gold Coast
at least two days ahead of 
time - having been specially
chartered by the English
Colonial Government to come
with all speed to Sierra Leone
making no stop on the way
in order to bring the news
of the threatened attack by the
King of Ashantee.</p>

<p>First outside of Cape Sierra
Leone - the S.S. Corisco Signalled
the S.S. Cameroon
bound down the Coast to
return to Sierra Leone for the
purpose of taking all the
available troops from this
place - after stopping an hour
at Sierra Leone for the
mails - the Corisco hurried on
to make the run as quickly

<pb n="605"/>

and place himself under British
protection.</p>

<p>It is reported that the Gamans
have paid more than £800. as
ransom for this captive Prince
on the repeated promises of 
the Ashantees to give him up,
but no sooner do they receive
the ransom money, than they
break their pledges.</p>

<p>The Kings demands were refused
by His Excellency the Governor and
we understand a counter demand
made upon the King to pay
up the <sic>instatment</sic> of indemnity
which it appears he has
failed to pay.</p>

<p>Every war like preparation
is now hastily being made
and the prospects for war
are as good as they have 
been in former times, when
severe fighting was the result.</p>

<p>About once every ten years
the Ashantees have a</p>
