<p>Bathurst River Gambia<lb/>
W C of Africa<lb/>
22d December 1857</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>I purpose showing your Excellency that the 
commerce of the United States with this place &amp; the
welfare of American citizens require the establishment
of an American Consulate at this port.</p>

<p>During the year about to end there have been Thirty one
American vessels here &amp; many <unclear extent="one word"/> sharing the need 
of some one to care for &amp; empowered to protect
American interests.</p>

<p>Seamen have been discharged from their ships against
their will &amp; without their 3 months advance, have sickened
&amp; died, &amp; once have been left behind in the Colonial 
Hospitals &amp; upon their recovery have ascertained that 
their ship had left &amp; in one case taking away the 
clothes of the seaman.</p>

<p>A case has thus come under my <unclear extent="one word"/>. A Mr Lee
2d Mate of the Bark Turk of Salem Mass was
discharged from his vessel without his 3 months wages.
Came to me in distress. I gave him employment.
it was during the sickly season. he was soon taken
ill with the African fever. I obtained lodging for 
him, sent my own Doctor to treat him (whose Bill
I now enclose hoping that I may be reimbursed)
upon his recovery there being no American vessels
here I obtained a passage for him to London.</p>

<pb n="20170615_161728"/>
    
<p>A petition in my favor signed by most of the <unclear>African</unclear>
merchants of New York &amp; many other private 
influential persons has already been filed in
the Department of State praying for the establishment 
of a Consulate here. The late Commander
in Chief of the Squadron Commodore <unclear>Crable</unclear> <unclear>was</unclear> 
quite aware of the necessity of a Consulate &amp; <unclear extent="one word"/>
me that he has communicated with your Excellency
relative thereto &amp; has recommended me for that 
post.</p>

<p>I <unclear extent="one word"/> that your Excellency will deign to give
your attention to this matter.</p>

<p>I am<lb/> 
Your Excellency's<lb/> 
Most Obdt. &amp; humble Servant<lb/>
Danl R. B. Upton</p>

<fw type="address">To His Excellency<lb/> 
The Honorable Lewis Cass<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
