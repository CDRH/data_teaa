<p>Race Superiority</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="article">

<p>The old question as to which race is superior has been done away with by the present conflict. In its place has crept a new doubt as to the superiority of any race. The <hi rend="italics">Independent</hi> says:</p>

<gap reason="sampling"/>

<p>But the war raises  the question of  race prejudice also in a broader form; not merely the claims of the Teutonic super-race but the claims of the "white race"  itself to eternal and inevitable superiority. Germany has no doubt on the matter. Inferior as are the non-Teutonic peoples of Europe in German eyes, they take rank above the "native" races of Asia and Africa to such a degree that slavery or the sword is the just wage of the latter. Note the German fury at the Allies for seeking the aid of Japan and for employing African troops on European battlefields. Remember the day when the Kaiser preached against the "yellow peril" in the spirit of yellow journalism. Read any good book or article on Germany's system of rule in her overseas colonies. It is true that private plantation owners in Belgian and Portuguese Africa, and even in a few parts of French Africa, have been excessively cruel to the native laborers in their employ. But nowhere have the officials of a government been so systematically oppressive as in German Africa. The atrocities in the Belgian Congo were the work of a soulless capitalism. The atrocities in German Southwest Africa were the work of bureaucrats inspired by racial arrogance and measureless contempt of those whom they ruled. If the preacher of race hate from the Mississippi valley or the Pacific Coast were to migrate to the banks of the Elbe, he would not only relieve us of his presence, but would find an appreciative audience and a true "spiritual home." Race prejudice is pro-Germanism.</p>

<p>If the hideous example of racial arrogance afforded by Germany does not suffice to cure us of our prejudices, there is another fact which should make us reflect. Who are the Allies? At least five nations among them&#8212;China, Japan, Siam, Liberia and Haiti&#8212;have no white population worth mentioning. An absolute majority of the people of the British Empire live in India; "white" men certainly, but also "natives" and non-Europeans. France and its colonies, if taken as a whole, contain nearly as much black as white, and French Indo-China contributes numerous yellow men to swell the total. Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Brazil, Cuba and others of the Allies have many non-white subjects and citizens. The United States, with its ten million Negroes and mixed-bloods, its Indian tribes, its Pacific colonies, cannot claim to be a racial unity. If we sum together all the people who are fighting against Germany, it seems probable that at least three out of four of them are "natives"; that is, people not descended from the races of Europe. Of course, the white race is the most largely represented on the actual battle line, but, since an army is only the delegate of a people, we should learn to think of the war was a league of all the races of mankind against the common foe of all humanity.</p>
