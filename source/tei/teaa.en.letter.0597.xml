<p>It is only for a few years past that
the exportation of Ground or Pea Nuts
has been so considerable; now it by
far exceeds all other exports in importance, 
and its cultivation has greatly 
benefited the agricultural interests
    
<pb n="20170616_095808"/>

of the Colony and the surrounding
country. France is the principal
<unclear>Continuer</unclear> and mostly for oleaginous
purposes and its importation gave
employment in the past year to 
18,800 tons of French shipping.</p>
    
<p>As is well known the quantity used 
in the United States for manufacturing 
or oleaginous purposes is very
small, owing chiefly to the heavy import 
duty of fifteen per centum ad
valorem. What an opening (in a
small way) for the employment 
of the surplus shipping of the United 
States, what a benefit to manufacturers
were those duties abolished: the producers 
in the United States would
perhaps suffer but would not the
benefit to shipping, and manufacturers,
more than counterbalance, any statement 
to the agriculturists.</p>
