<note>Received Dec 25 1866</note>

<p>F. W. Seward Esqr<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Your
communication of the 21st ult in reply to mine of
the 14th has been received.</p>

<p>I am requested
to inform the Department why my <unclear>account for</unclear>
rent of Office was not presented quarterly</p>

<p>I wrote to the 
Department while in Africa in regard the rent of 
the Office and received for answer that if I would procure
and forward to the Department a certificate signed 
by two respectable merchants to the effect that <unclear extent="one or two words"/> 
built an office and used said Office expressly for 
Governement purposes one for no other. That upon 
receipt of such a certificate the Department would 
inform me of its decision. I immediately forwarded 
<unclear>Gordon</unclear> &amp; <unclear>Bremmer</unclear> certifying to the above facts also 
certifying that in their judgment the rent of said 
Office was worth one hundred and fifty dollars 
per annum. I never received any reply to the
certificate. I delayed writing again in regard to this 
matter not wishing to call attention again to the subject which
I supposed was already under consideration.</p>

<p>I disliked too to press the claim after once fairly presenting 
it at a time when it seemed to me you must 
have so much of greater importance to occupy your 
attention. Another <del>diffi</del> reason too was the difficulty 
experienced in that far off out of the way country in 
getting drafts cashed without paying such extreme
rates of exchange &amp; then perhaps not at all.</p>

<p>The above are the plainly stated reasons 

<pb n="20170615_113529"/>

why I did not present <unclear>quartly</unclear> accounts &amp; collect next 
<unclear>quartly</unclear> for my Office. I am quite sure I want nothing
but what is just and honorable in the matter.</p>

<p>Your 
Communication states that my account cannot be
allowed until proper vouchers are furnished the
Department. The voucher before <sic>refered</sic> to as 
having been signed by Messrs Gordon &amp; <unclear>Bremmer</unclear> I think 
must have been received by the Department if so please
inform me <unclear>what</unclear> other vouchers are necessary. If said
voucher was not received please inform me; and I 
would most respectfully request your indulgence
in this matter as I have no dates of communications
written while in Africa</p>

<p>I am Sir with the highest 
consideration your most humble 
&amp; <sic>obedent</sic> servant<lb/> 
Henry May<lb/>
Late U.S. Comml. Agt.<lb/>
at Gaboon River W. A.<lb/> 
Now at Ames Story County Iowa<lb/>
December 21st 1866</p>
