<p>Consulate of the United States<lb/>
Zanzibar June 23 1890</p>

<p>Honorable William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>I have the honor to address 
the Department at this
time in relation to affairs
on the Brava Coast.
On the 7th instant I cabled
as follows viz:</p>

<p>"State Department<lb/>
Washington.<lb/>
Brava Coast unsettled
American interests jeopardized<lb/>
Pratt"</p>

<p>By letters received on
that date we learned of an
uprising of the natives at
Muka and that they had
looted the town - securing
some 150 <unclear extent="one word"/> the American
house of Roper <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co.
<catchwords>and</catchwords>

<pb facs="152924"/>

and upwards of 5000
from British Indian merchants.</p>

<p>Messrs Roper <unclear extent="one word"/> &amp; Co.
who have large interests
at stake in that vicinity
immediately consulted with
me and it was at their
earnest solicitation that
I cabled the Department.
It being understood
that my cablegram would
supplement my statement
made to the Department by
representatives of R.E. &amp; Co.
who would visit Washington 
for that purpose.</p>

<p>The primary cause of
the disturbance is the concession 
of the Coast to the
Imperial British East
Africa Company and through
them to the Italians.
<catchwords>Having</catchwords>

<pb facs="152928"/>

Having spent some
months on the Brava Coast
and having acquainted
myself with the habits and
disposition of the natives
of that country. I am certain 
that any move in
the direction of European
interference will result in
complete demoralization.</p>

<p>The Italians disclaim
any present intention of
placing Europeans in that
district, and propose to
administer affairs from
Zanzibar.</p>

<p>During a recent
interview with the Sultan
I expressed the hope that
he would discourage the
visits of Foreign ships of
war to that coast and
suggested that His Majesty 
send one of his own
ships with a commissioner
empowered

<pb facs="152934"/>

empowered to <unclear extent="one word"/> with
the <unclear>natives</unclear>. His Majesty
<unclear>proceeded</unclear> to do so <unclear extent="one word"/>
that such a <unclear>course</unclear>
will be <unclear extent="one word"/> for
some <unclear extent="two words"/> to the
difficulty in making a
landing at this season.</p>

<p>By the granting of
the concession to the Imperial
British East African Company
the estate states of affairs
has been altered. Yet
I trust that the Department
may see its way clear
to call a halt in the direction
of European occupation
of this coast since otherwise
the Americans engaged
in that trade will suffer
a great loss, and perhaps
be compelled to retire
altogether from this hitherto
profitable field of
operations.</p>

<p><catchwords>I</catchwords>

<pb facs="152938"/>

I await the sanction
of the Department before
sending in accounts for
cost of cablegram before
<unclear extent="one word"/>.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Sir<lb/>
Your obedient servant<lb/>
Seth A. Pratt<lb/>
U.S. Consul</p>
