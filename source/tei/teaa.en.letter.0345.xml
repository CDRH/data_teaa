<p>Patsy Estate<lb/>
Johanna 25 June 1889</p>

<p>Seth A Pratt Esqr<lb/>
U.S. Consul<lb/>
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I last wrote to you on the 19th inst
and sent letters by the American Whaler
"Kathleen" and no doubt you have on this
received them. I however enclose press copies
of the same herewith. I wrote to you that
three Johannamen were on their way to you
to give their testimony and to be away from the
vengeance of the Sultan. One Dray man <unclear extent="two words"/>
has got as far as <unclear>Comoro</unclear> but the other two
Aloe Shi and Halliday Shi were arrested as they
were on the point of embarking in a canoe to go
on board of Capt Giffords vessel. They were imprisoned
for the night and in the morning taken before the
Sultan who abused and threatened them all he
knew how and will not permit any more vessels
leave in the night for fear they may get on boat
and get away and give evidence against him
These two men have <unclear extent="one word"/> written statements what
I have had "Englishized" and at their request herewith 
enclose to you. It simply shows what


<pb facs="150144"/>

what means and devices this old tyrant
will use to further his own ends. The French
handle him pretty roughly at times but when
he demands pardon <unclear extent="one word"/> all over and they
are as thick and happy as bees together <unclear extent="one word"/>
I am anxious to know how the
arbitrating business in my case is to be <unclear extent="one word"/>
If the Resident and French Government
call their <unclear extent="one word"/> a proper investigation I
do not and enter every point I have
demanded is given into I certainly protest
against it. Here the Resident calls any
one he chooses and asks any question he chooses
without my <unclear>knowing</unclear> any thing about it
on an opportunity of refuting any false
statements: but so far as I can learn
they cannot bring one such thing against
me, although they would the affairs of
supplies to his brother which I think they
have given to that they have not a leg to stand
on there. They might as well accuse you as me.
But over there, that was not the <unclear extent="one word"/>
of my grievances &amp; the serious ones too. His
brother only rebelled in 1884 &amp; my trouble date from
1882. If all works well here I intend going
<unclear>hence</unclear> on this business and I am glad we
have the Hon: J. G. Blane to the which <unclear extent="one word"/>
of the Hon. T. F. Bayard. I cannot imagine

<pb facs="150151"/>

the Hon. Mr Bayard <unclear extent="four words"/>
a treaty as the French have here. <unclear>Apparently</unclear>
they are not responsible for anything and
<unclear extent="three words"/> hold the Sultan responsible.
I have been writing to the Resident about
the salve trade treaty here with the English and
requested a reply to my letter but he would
not write but came out to see me. He did not
recognize the English treaty at all. He says they
have made a treaty since which holds the slave
five years longer &amp;c. Of course the English
Consul at Zanzibar will know about this
and I wish you would call upon on this matter.
According to the English treaty all slaves are
to be absolutely free in August next, French
say free yes but they must work for their
masters five years <unclear>more</unclear> and then engage
for another five years!! I think "<unclear>Extra</unclear> <unclear extent="one word"/>"
will grow under that business. Anyone
can buy a slaves labour now for 150 <unclear>francs</unclear> for
five years if he wishes. I would like to
know the English opinion of it. Of course
slaves are bought and sold here daily and have been
ever since the English Treaty and <unclear extent="four words"/>
French have "the ball". They say the English have
not <unclear extent="about five words"/> of the treaty.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear from you soon &amp; <unclear>patiently</unclear><lb/>
I am your obedient servant
B. F. Wilson</p>

<p>Patsy Estate<lb/>
Johanna 29 July 1889</p>

<p>Seth A. Pratt Esqr<lb/>
U.S. Consul<lb/>
Zanzibar</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>Your two valuable favors of the
dates 31st May and 2nd July duly to hand
by this months courrier. The U.S.S. <unclear extent="one word"/>
was too late to be of any service as regards the
enquiry and I do not know but it is all
for the best that there was no vessel here or
no representant of my Government. I never
feared any thing but false statements and
lies and my only reason for <unclear>wanting</unclear> a
word myself on a U.S. Government Official
that could prove that but as they have had
all their own way they cannot surely
find any fault. The only thing I
fear now is that the U.S. Government will
be too <unclear extent="one word"/> and not <unclear>back</unclear> my claim.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Baron <unclear extent="one or two words"/> by
the last mail. (a <unclear>Persian</unclear>) He says that
my Government have not proved my claim
and they will have to if I am <unclear extent="one word"/>.
Do you think I should go home for
that purpose? It is now <unclear extent="two or three words"/>

<pb facs="150207"/>

and I would not like to leave here unless
necessary. Still I could do so. I could
only relate some facts and important ones
which perhaps have not been written but if
the U.S. Government observe well all that has
been sent to the Department of State since 1884
they will have my case pretty well. I know
the French Government will wish to get out of
it by saying the King cannot pay. He has nothing
they say. He could have paid and would
have paid if the French had kept out of these
islands. I consider now that they are
responsible for the Sultan and I have good
French Authority also for saying this. His
action is political and they are responsible.</p>

<p>I am astonished that the U.S. Government
and the English Government also did not
object from the first to one or two Articles
in their Treaty of the Protectorate. Perhaps they
have. Certainly Mr. Blaine will bring
them to their hearings.</p>

<p>You no doubt have had the "<unclear extent="one word"/>" with
you on this. It does ones' heart good
to see an American man of war: They
are altogether too rare.</p>

<p>Hoping to hear good news
from you and the Department of State<lb/>
I am Your obedient servant<lb/>
B. F. Wilson</p>

<p>Translation of letter of Aloe Shi <unclear extent="one word"/></p>

<p>I Aloe Shi Dreyman do hereby swear by the <unclear>Koran</unclear> that
I went to French Resident of Johanna three
days in succession and <unclear extent="two words"/> three different
times to give my testimony while he was making the
enquiry. I went to tell what I know that Sultan
Abdallah had done to Dr. Wilson and these times
I was acompanied by Halliday Shi. On the third
day the Resident told us he would not take our statements
at all. <unclear>About</unclear> the same time he was taking the
statements of men who Sultan Abdallah sent. We
came to the conclusion (Halliday and myself) that we
would go to Zanzibar and make our statements there
and intended to letter passage in the vessel of Capt
Gifford ("Kathleen") but were taken and imprisoned
by the Police of the Sultan and kept in prison until morning
when we were taken before the Sultan. who said to 
us "you wish to run away and go to sea". The reason
that we wished to go to Zanzibar was that the Sultan
sent to me one Said Omar and told me that
I must go before the Resident and swear that
the Doctor agreed to give me three thousand dollars
if I would be witness for him. I informed this
<unclear>morning</unclear> that I could not tell such a lie about the
Doctor but he the Sultan should go and tell this to the Resident <unclear/>
<unclear extent="three lines"/>

<pb facs="150259"/>

one hundred and twenty six dollars and if the
American Government does not <unclear extent="one word"/> well this
Sultan will kill us. He told me also that he would not
allow me to go to Patsy to Dr Wilson, and I want the
U.S. Consul to know all of this.</p>

<p>Translation of the <unclear extent="one word"/> letter of Halliday Shi <unclear extent="about four words"/></p>

<p><unclear extent="three lines of text"/>
I went to the Resident of France in Johanna at three
different times to tell what I know about the Sultan
Abdallah and Dr. Wilson. I went to the Resident
accompanied by Aloe Shi and on the third
day he told me &amp; Aloe Shi that he would not take
<unclear>any</unclear> more evidence at all, but when Sultan
Abdallahs men came to him he took their evidence.</p>

<p><unclear extent="one word"/> Aloe Shi and my self wished to go to Zanzibar
to give our evidence there and attempted to
go on board of the American ship of Capt Gofford
and the Sultan sent his police and arrested
us and put us in prison until morning and
said to us that we wanted to run away and
<unclear>Sultan</unclear> Abdallah called me to his house and <unclear>abused</unclear>
me and for the reason that I wished to be a witness
for Dr Wilson. He called me in his <unclear extent="one word"/> an <unclear extent="one word"/>
and all of this is true. If we do not get relief
from this man we will die. And all of his people
say that if he the Sultan gets the best of Dr Wilson in
his complaint he will cut off all of the heads that
had given evidence against him. You must
<unclear extent="about four words"/> is the truth only that I say.</p>
