<p>Whereas under the present Constitution of the Republic of Liberia, the Executive power is prohibited from granting pardons in cases of impeachment, and offenders in high places can only be reached and punished by resort to actions of impeachment; and yet as a young and growing people, it is not conducive to the well being and best interest of this Republic to be fettered with the common law practice of other nations, in such cases, which make the judgment irreversible: Therefore,</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">It is resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Republic of Liberia in Legislature assembled,–</hi>and passed by the concurrence of two thirds of the members of each branch of the Legislature, That the following shall form the last paragraph of the first section of Article III to wit: Any person or persons who has or have been impeached, or who may be impeached hereafter for any official misconduct in office, or for high crimes and misdemeanors, within this Republic, shall be privileged after the expiration of seven years from the time of impeachment to petition the Legislature of the Republic of Liberia for restoration to all the rights and privileges of any other good citizens. And should it appear to the Legislature that the person or persons thus petitioning has or have shown sufficient evidence of reformation and repentance, then and in that case the Legislature may by Joint Resolution, to be adopted by a two third vote of the members of each branch of the Legislature, restore and grant unto the person or persons petitioning, all the rights privileges and immunities guaranteed to all other good citizens. Resolved further, that this amendment to the Constitution of the Republic <sic>or</sic> Liberia pass each branch by a two third vote as required by the second section of Article II of the Constitution; and that the said amendment be submitted to the people for their vote at the biennial election to be held in May 1879 in the several counties of this Republic;
