<p>Clydesdale, Albert Park<lb/>
Didsbury, Manchester<lb/>
14 June 1885</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>I beg most respectfully to
address Your Excellency through advice of Mr.
Consul L de R du Verge, and to enclose 
originals of two documents in my possession
when acting as Vice Consul for the United
States of America, and as British Consul at
St. Paul de Loanda and I crave Your Excellency's
kind attention to my request and to the facts
as follows:</p>

<p>I have been in St Paul de Loanda
upwards of five years with Messieurs Newton
Carnegie &amp; Co, Merchants of that city and left
in March last on account of ill health, and
<catchwords>not</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0529.002"/>

not being desirous of returning to that place,
but to one a little more salubrious, venture
to beg of Your Excellency the appointment as
representation of the United States Government
at some other place should there be a vacancy.</p>

<p>When passing the Cape de Verde
Islands I had the pleasure of meeting the
American Consul there (at St. Thiago) who
told me he had suffered greatly of late
through fevers, and did not feel at all satisfied,
and desired to leave as soon as possible.
Should this be the case I may say that
Your Excellency could rely upon my faithfully
fulfilling the duties of that post, I being
thoroughly conversant with the Portuguese
language, and well acquainted with the
inhabitants of that Island, and where am
<catchwords>very</catchwords>

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0529.003"/>

very desirous of going if possible</p>

<p>During my stay with Messieurs
Newton Carnegie &amp; Co at Loanda I had ample
time to study the duties of the Consulate, and
often performed same under Vice Consul
Robert Scott Newton's supervision.</p>

<p>It has long been my earnest
desire to serve the American Government and
should Your Excellency deem it advisable to
grant me an appointment at S Thiago or 
any other port. I can only say that I
shall always have the interests of the
Government at heart, and endeavor in every
way to prove myself worthy of the honor, conferred
upon us. I am 25 years of age, and
should Your Excellency desire a personal
interview I shall be only too happy to cross
the Atlantic whenever Your Excellency may
demand

<pb facs="teaa.en.letter.0529.004"/>

demand it, and are prepared to leave England
at any time</p>

<p>I have the honor to be<lb/>
Your Excellency's<lb/>
Most obedient and
Humble Servant,<lb/>
(s) Wm S Bent</p>

<p>To 
His Excellency<lb/>
The President of
The United States of America<lb/>
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c
Washington
D.C.</p>
