<p>[ . . . ]</p>

<p>In North Africa, missions are located in Morocco, Algiers, Tunis,
Abyssinia, and Egypt. One of the most flourishing of all the missions 
in this region is that of the American United Presbyterian
Church. It has occupied the field more than thirty years, and has
many centres and a large native as well as American agency employed. 
Most of the stations are on the Nile, south of Cairo, with
sixty-five schools, and five thousand four hundred and fourteen scholars. 
Fifty-seven of these schools are supported by the fees of the
native congregations. The converts are mostly from among the
Copts.</p>

<p>In East and East Central Africa, mission work has been carried
on at great expense of money and life. It was in this region that

<pb n="p25"/>

Bishop Hannington fell, and here also the native Christians, under
Mwanga's rule, proved themselves faithful until death.</p>

<p>In south Africa, mission work has been done among the Caffrarians, 
the Zulus, the Basutos, and other tribes. In the vicinity of
the European colonies, the natives have been brought to some ex-
tent under the influence of Christian civilization. The Free
Church of Scotland has an important school at Lovedale, about
seven hundred miles northeast of Cape Town. Besides the literary
and theological course, various trades are taught&#8212;carpentering,
printing, book-binding, wagon-making, tailoring. etc.</p>

<p>On the west coast of Africa, the American Presbyterian mission 
has been <sic>harrassed</sic> and impeded by the French authorities, and
the statement is published that the work will probably be transferred
to some other point. The English and American Baptists have been
doing valuable work on the Congo, and lately an account was given
of a very remarkable work of grace in connection with this mission,
which resulted in the conversion of over a thousand of the natives.
On the river Niger the Church Missionary Society of England established 
a mission thirty years ago, under the leadership of the well-known 
African Bishop Crowther.</p>

<p>Rev. H. H. Messenger, formerly a missionary of the American
Episcopal Church to Liberia, writes: "On reading Bishop Ferguson's 
account of his reception at Cape Palmas on his return as Bishop,
a realizing sense of God's mercy and goodness filled my heart with
thankfulness. Twenty-six years ago, three married couples of us
passed through the same place; the orphan girls of the school coming 
down on the rocks and singing for us; the big waves soon after
rolling heavily in, making us catch our breath as they lifted the boat
and rushed us forward at nearly railroad speed. We were strangers,
and of a different race, yet received by friends because of the Name
of Jesus. Now what do we behold ? One of their own number, exalted 
to the highest position in the Church of God, goes back to them
to be their guide in spiritual matters. He was but a boy in school
when I was there, remembered ever since as very apt and ready at
the examinations which we attended, under the faithful drilling of
the Rev. Dr. Crummell. All the white missionaries composing
our force then, have long since ceased their labors there; some lying
in the graveyards in Africa; some in graves in America; a few yet
alive in hoary age. But the work goes on, now more certain to be
permanent, doubtless, than before; for instead of an alien here and
there striving against the dangers of the climate and doing what he
could to create a light in the darkness for a few years, and then succumbing

<pb n="p26"/>

to disease, and dying or forced to leave the mission; now
men of the same race, able to bear the climate, having their families
and all their interest there <hi rend="italics">to stay</hi>. All this promises permanence
in the work."</p>

<p>Bishop Taylor has determined to use Liberia with its settled
communities of Christian Africans, with its organized government,
recognized by the nations, its industrial and educational appliances,
and its social regulations, as a base and support of his operations.
He has arranged for opening a dozen industrial schools, the kings
and chiefs of each tribe visited agreeing to plant and attend to the
first crops of food required by the mission, and to furnish sites for
buildings, and all the land required for farming and grazing purposes;
and to build cook-houses, school-houses, and mission houses; while
the Bishop agrees to provide teachers, preachers, and all other things
necessary to put the missions upon a self-supporting basis. Five of
these new stations on the Cavalla river, which enters the ocean near
Cape Palmas, are the business centers of inland tribes from which,
thousands of people can be reached. This river, navigable by
steamboats, is reported by the Bishop as having high banks and hills
as healthy as those of our own Hudson.</p>

<p>Congo Land now has also its Roman Catholic Bishop; the Arch-Bishop 
of Paris having consecrated the missionary priest Corrie, in
conformity to an order from the Pope, Bishop of Congo Land.
Monsignor Corrie is almost forty years old, and is described as
an uncommonly active and energetic missionary, who knows how to
put his hands to everything, and in the latest field of his operations was
school-master, engineer, and all in all as a pioneer of civilization. A
few months ago he founded a mission station nearly 200 miles above
Stanley Pool. The new apostolic vicar will be accompanied by about
forty co-workers and several of the sisters of Saint Joseph, who will
open schools for boys and girls, and will teach the women the handiwork 
of civilization. The future episcopal seat will be in Loango.</p>

<p>The Bible has been translated into sixty-six of the languages of
Africa. The Semitic family has 10 distinct languages and 9 dialects:
the Hamitic, 29 languages and 27 dialects; the Nuba-Fulah, 17 languages 
and 7 dialects; the Negro, 195 languages and 49 dialects; the
Bantu, 163 languages and 55 dialects; and the Hottentot-Bushman,
14 languages and 6 dialects&#8212;the six families having 438 languages.
and 153 dialects, a total of 591. It may lead to a better understanding 
if it is stated that, of these families or groups, the Semitic, the
Nuba-Fulah and the Bantu have each two branches, the Hamitic and
Hottentot-Bushman three and the Negro four. Of these languages&#8212;

<pb n="p27"/>

of which it is impossible to <sic>gvie</sic> the names&#8212;the Bible, in whole or in
part, has been translated into sixty-six. The following have the entire 
Bible: The Arabic, Amharic, Koptic,.Ashantee, Akva, Yoruba,
Efik, Zulu, Kaffir, Sesuto and Sechuana&#8212;the American Bible Society 
publishing the Arabic and the Zulu translations, and the Scotch
Bible Society the Efik, while the Koptic translation is still in manuscript, 
and the British and Foreign Bible Society publish the remaining 
seven. As experiences on the west coast of Africa and the history 
of the English and of Luther's Bible indicate that when the language 
of a country is in a state of transition it will gravitate around a
translation of the scriptures, it seems reasonably certain that considerably
less than 100 translations will meet the wants of the entire
African Continent.</p>

<p>The Colonial <sic>enterprizes</sic> of France and Germany have awakened
a general interest in African Missionary labors among the citizens
of the French Republic and of the German Empire. The sixty-first
annual report of the Evangelical Missionary Society of Paris
gives particulars of its work for 1885-86. Its mission are five in
number, and are established in South Africa and upon the river
Zambezi, in Tahiti, in Senegal, and in Algiers. The number of
French missionaries, not including wives and lady assistants, is thirty-four. 
The total money receipts for the year were 320,000 francs.
The South African Mission among the Basutos, west of Natal, is the
largest, reporting sixteen stations and twenty-three French missionaries, 
with forty-four out-stations, manned by 142 native helpers.
The Society has decided to begin a mission on the right bank of
the Congo, where the French possess about 300 miles of country,
In conjunction with Christian teaching, the Society hopes to add,
something to the scientific knowledge of Africa, and to this end
the "French Association for the Advancement of Science" has
granted it a subvention.</p>

<p>In Germany, a number of new Missions in Africa have been commenced. 
The Basle Missionary Society has sent five laborers to the
Cameroons, where the English Baptists have committed their work
to the Baselers, and removed to the Congo. In New Guinea, in King
William's Land, the Rhine Missionary Society, the Neuendettelsauer
Missionary Society, and the Allgemeine Evangelical Protestantische
Missions-Verein, have either already commenced, or purpose to
commence missionary work in the new German domain. A new
Lutheran Missionary Society in Bavaria, one in Berlin, and a third
one, the Neukirchner Missionary Society, are making preparations to
do mission work in East Africa. The East African Missionary Society

<pb n="p28"/>

has been formed in Berlin, for operations in the German dominions
in southern Equatorial Africa and Somali-land, having in mind both
the German settlers and the native populations. A well-known
missionary, Mr. Greiner, late of the Saint Chrischona Mission, led
the first party.</p>
