<note>No 158</note>

<p>U.S. Consulate, Goree-Dakar<lb/>
August 25 1892</p>

<p>To the Honorable<lb/>
William F. Wharton<lb/>
Assistant Secretary of State</p>

<p>Sir: The Dispatch from the
Department No 68 in reference to a
special duty of 7% which has
been levied on merchandise not
imported into the Colony from
France is received, and as requested.
I shall be able to reply by return of mail.</p>

<p>The Subject in question has
already been mentioned in two
of my Dispatches, Nos 128 &amp; 129
to which I would again respectfully
call the attention of the Department.
Since they were written an opportunity
has been afforded to test the working
of the new system, which has without
doubt proved prejudicial to foreigners
and correspondingly advantageous
to French Commercial interests.
As an index to the check which

<pb n="20170619_152956"/>

American Commercial interests
have received I may mention
that my Consular Fees, which
amounted to $87.01 for the March
Quarter of 1890 which was before
the new system began to take
effect, were reduced to $53.49
for the March Quarter of 1891 and
to $23.82 for the March Quarter
of 1892, the diminution for the other
quarters being about in the same ratio.
The supply of American Goods however
has not diminished quite in this
ratio, as those which were accounted
indispensable for the trade and were
small in bulk as compared with 
cost have come by the expensive
steam route via Liverpool.</p>

<p>But there appears to be an
error in the assumption that
the Colonial Government here
is primarily responsible for
this special duty of 7%. The
party responsible is the "Minister
of the Colonies and of Commerce"

<pb n="20170619_153001"/>

in Paris. He I understand wanted
to make the special duty more than
seven per cent, but was restrained
by advice from the colony to the
effect that a greater rate might
drive the natives to the English
possessions adjoining and thus
defeat the intent of advantage.
Senegal it should be borne in
mind is not a Colony in the
independent sense that Canada &amp;
Australia are Colonies. It sends
its Deputy to the "Chambre", and 
is to all essential intents &amp; purposes
closely federated with France.</p>

<p>The motive of the French
Government in so shaping the 
Commercial policy of this Colony
is to give a greater proportion
of its now valuable trade to 
French Manufacturers and to
French vessels. And as
some success seems already
to have resulted from the
means adopted the name

<pb n="20170619_153006"/>

Government will not be
induced I think lightly to abandon this policy.</p>

<p>Concerning Senegal Gum
and whether a threatened
duty on this article by us
would cause the French
Government to relax something
in our favor or not I do not
feel qualified to give an opinion.
I do not know in the first 
place to what extent it may
be a necessity with our manufacturers.
If it is a necessity the higher 
price caused by a duty would
of course have to be borne by
ourselves, and by augmenting
the prices of such articles as
it entered into it would by 
so much incapacitate them
for competing in foreign markets.
On the contrary if cheap
substitutes could be provided
in case of an advance in
price the balance of Hedgehog

<pb n="20170619_153011"/>

advantage might for ought
I know be rather against
France. Senegal cannot export
to us its principal product,
Peanuts, because we have a tariff
which has proved prohibitive
against them. But they come to
us just the same in the shape
of "Olive Oil" which is manufactured
in France, and who knows what
might be done with the very limited
quantity of Gum Senegal there is
in the world if an enhanced
price should put it beyond
the reach of our own manufacturers?
These are merely suggestions on
my part. I do not profess to
very deeply understand the subject.</p>

Portland, Maine, July 6th 1892.</ab>

<p>Hon. John W. Foster,<lb/>
Secretary of State<lb/>
Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>Duties at the French Colony of Senegal, W.C. Africa.</p>

<p>Besides being large exporters to the Spanish Colonies,
we are very largely interested in, not only the French West
Indies, but also the French Colony of Senegal, having a branch
house at St. Louis in that colony.</p>

<p>Our Manager there, Mr. Francis Lawton, who is also
Consular Agent for the United States, under Consul Strickland
at Goree, informs us that of late the Provincial Council at
St. Louis (the capital of Senegal) have levied a special 7%
duty against all foreign importations, other than those coming
from the mother country, France, which pay only the 5% general
duty, thus making the duty of American imports 12%; or, in
other words, placing American goods, which are about the only
articles <sic>xompeting</sic> against those from France, at 7% disadvantage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this Colony of Senegal, finds its
largest and best paying outlet in this country for their
Senegal Gum, which is <sic>laregly</sic> used here among Cotton Manufacturers,
Confectioners, etc, etc, and which under our present
tariff, is allowed free entry.</p>

<p>But very little, if any other production of Senegal, is
imported for consumption in the States, consequently while we
can only ship to Senegal under an almost prohibitive <sic>protectn</sic>
duty our Government is allowing them free entry of one of
their most important, and largest production, the consequence
is, at the present time, our trade, as well as that of the 

<pb n="20170619_153051"/>

Boston and New York shippers, has been very much reduced, in
fact, almost stopped, while the Senegal imports from France
have been correspondingly on the increase, and it is only a
question of a short time when our U.S. trade with Senegal,
which heretofore has assumed to show most favorable new
openings for American productions, will be completely lost
while they will continue to enjoy the favorable market which
we are furnishing them so freely, for their large Gum productions,
all, or nearly all of which, comes here via France, where
the bulk of the productions of Senegal are controlled and
handled.</p>

<p>Yours very truly,<lb/>
J. H. Hamlen &amp; Son.</p>
